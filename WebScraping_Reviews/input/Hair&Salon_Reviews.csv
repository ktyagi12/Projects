"One of the best barbershops I've been to, with great prices. I honestly couldn't be happier with the love that comes out of this place, the environment is quite amazing and comfortable. I remember the day I found this place, they've been a success with my cuts since day 1. Thank you.",positive
Took my son in for a haircut. Barber was great he did exactly what I wanted. Very clean cut will definitely be coming in more often.,positive
"Walked in, said hi. The only barber in there did not have a courtesy to say hi back. He was too busy watching the soccer game while cutting the hair. Stood in front of the reception desk for few minutes. Nothing. Left and will not be back.",negative
I came here 10 minutes before 9am to get a haircut. They are open at 9am on Saturday's according to their hours of operation. It is now 9:15 and I left because no one showed up. There was 5 other people waiting as well and they didn't seem too happy either. I am in search of a new Barber but it definitely will not be here.,negative
"Great haircut. No fuss no muss, I asked for layers and ""V"" shape to the back. Exactly what I ordered. And the price? Awesome! Under $20 for a haircut? You can't beat it. I will be returning to this salon.",positive
"Love this place great atmosphere and energy. Very convenient place I can get everything in one stop from an outfit and accessories to mani, pedi and hair a true one stop salon. I will recommend to any one.",positive
Loved this salon. It is very clean an smells good all the clients walking out had beautiful hair. I was really pleased with my stylist Tammi Mitchell. Lots of great deals. I will definitely be back,positive
"I will never recommend this business to anyone. The owner, Lidia, was so rude and unprofessional. She belittled me and wasn't even interested in taking my name. I suppose what you look like is all that matters to her, not the money in your pocket.",negative
"I bought a Groupon from Sandra Lynn Rosendin for a mani-pedi, not realizing how far this salon was from The Strip. I actually spent more in Uber transport to the appointment than I spent on the Groupon. I was glad I hadn't done the bus--as I had planned. Too far! BUT...Sandra Lynn did a great job, and, really, no regrets. She took good care of me, and if I were a local, I would be there every week, asking S.L. to continue my great mani-pedi care. She was busy, on New Year's Eve day, and took me at 12:30pm because she had a cancellation. She had been willing to stay late to honor my Groupon--even on a holiday, even knowing I wasn't a local, and thus a repeat customer. Now, that's kindness, AND good service. Thank you Sandra Lynn! You made my day. I cannot say enough: CALL SANDRA Lynn. She will do an awesome job and has a sunny attitude. They offer a first time discount at this salon, so why not give it a try.",positive
Ester is fabulous with hair. She colors and nourishes your hair with so much care. You leave there wanting to keep running your fingers through it. I love my hair!!!! Ester is the BEST!!!!,positive
Oh my gosh....I had to post. I love my hair extensions! Thank you...the lady who did them was Ester. She was awesome. I can't wait to show my boyfriend :) I called and got prices from many salons and this one was the best for what you get. It was on W Sahara...a little out of my way because I live in Green Valley but worth the drive.,positive
"I love this place! My hairdresser Ester is the Best! She has done my 20"" extensions for over 3 years and this salon is great. The owners are accessible and down to earth. They love their clients and we LOVE them!",positive
First time at Adore and a I had a great experience. Cheryl did an awesome job. I got my haircut exactly the way I wanted. She is an excellent hairstylist. I totally recommend this place.,positive
"Risa is the best stylist ever!! I have difficult curly hair and Risa was really good about making it look great. She is attentive, works well with you in reaching hair goals like getting dead hair to a healthier state. TOTALLY going to her again. XD",positive
"First time here at Adore. It has a great atmosphere and the service is prompt and courteous. Jen Lewis is the stylist that cut my hair. She has a great eye and makes sure that the style you ask for will really work for your face shape and style. Jen is very meticulous, creating exactly the look you want. I would recommend her to anyone needing a new stylist in the Las Vegas area!",positive
Loved coming here to get my weekly haircut with my barber UNTIL they suddenly closed it down. Worst part is I was told via text! I can understand a text appointment reminder or even text cancelation but to tell me the barbershop is closing down and my barber is no long with the company is in bad taste 100%. I had higher expectations for this place.,negative
"The staff was incredibly nice and the location is beautiful. I was disappointed, however, because they did two spray tans and neither was what I was looking for. The second appointment was to correct the first but it still didn't come out. People kept asking me when I was going to get a tan bc you couldn't really tell a difference at all. I was bummed with the results.",negative
"I go to Charissa at Altered Ego and I am always satisfied with the results. I am the kind of person who has an idea of what i want when i go in, but im not always sure how it will look. She does a terrific job of taking a little guidance and running with it and she is not afraid to give her opinion or give you something to consider when you are trying something new. I love love love my cut and color! Thanks Charissa! P.S. it doesn't hurt there is a cute little coffee shop literally within 100 feet of the salon. That can be a life-saver!",positive
"Sat at the salon for an hour arguing with the stylist on what I wanted(had a picture). Then she tells me that they didn't book enough time for me to get anything done past a hair cut..I wanted a cut and balayage. When I booked I was told I was the last appt for her so she would have plenty of time and I overly explained to whoever booked the appt, that I had a lot of hair(just thick)and needed time. I understand that when it comes to color, it might take a session or two. But the whole reason I went to this place was because the last salon I talked to said that they were going to charge me $300 for what I wanted done which I know is bogus because I'm cutting off half of my hair and I'm not coloring my whole head! I went completely blonde for $150!! And it was perfect! So I tried this place and turns out they overbooked and underquoted me. I walked out frustrated, upset and will never be back. Unbelievable....if you have a lot of hair, I do not recommend.",negative
"HUGE shout out to Kasondra for rescuing my hair! After a botched balayage-turned-90s highlight job that was done at another salon, I stopped by Altered Ego for a consultation since it was on my way home. When I told the very nice receptionist what had happened, she grabbed Kasondra and Kasondra took her time in telling me how exactly she would fix it and how much it would cost. I booked an appointment for two days later and couldn't be happier with the results. Kasondra is also very sweet and made the entire process comfortable and enjoyable. The atmosphere of the place is also awesome, the decor is really pretty and all of the stylists there seemed to be having a good time and enjoying each other's company. I am so happy to have found my new salon, even if it started from less than ideal circumstances. P.S. The coffee shop is also very good!",positive
"The salon is cute, clean, and filled with chandeliers! Angie did an excellent job with my hair! She listened to my general idea, exasperated by the fact I'm pregnant and always burning up, and gave me a cut that is cute, easy to style, and, best of all, light and short enough to keep me cool! I've definitely found my stylist and will return to Angie at Altered Ego again and again. The prices are reasonable, and the salon offers a wide variety of products. I also had a coupon for a drink at the espresso bar next door with Male Ego, and my drink was delicious :)",positive
"Lauren was my stylist and she did AMAZING! I showed her a picture of the blonde I wanted and explained I didn't want it as light as the picture, but not like the golden blonde I had. She was super nice the entire time and my hair turned out perfectly. I am so happy I went today and will definitely be coming back!",positive
"This is the first salon that has gained my trust in quite a while. It's always difficult to find somewhere new after a move. However, I was recommended by my roommate to book an appointment with Mylissa and judging by the job she did on my roomate's hair, I was sold. She is the biggest sweetheart ever, loves her job, and her clients! She really worked with me and achieved exactly what I wanted. She's great at doing color corrections, color melts, ombres, and cuts. Her hands are like magic and she is an artist in the Salon world. I probably won't be visiting any other stylist while I live here in Tempe. This shop has a great energy. Everyone is so welcoming and happy to be here! :)",positive
"What was a perfect day was ruined by horrible customer service. Let's start from the beginning. I'm getting married and came to learn about Altered Ego at the AZ bridal show. At the show I was attracted to them because they did vintage hairstyles. I was given a $50 gift card at the bridal show. I called today to get info on how the bridal hair works. I was informed that for $50 I could do a trial run. They had a cancellation and were able to get me in today. Upon arriving to the shop I was greeted by two friendly ladies at the front desk. I had to wait a little longer than expected but didn't mind since the atmosphere was inviting. Nicque my stylist came out and escorted me to the joint coffee shop called Solo. Cool concept, you can order a variety of drinks and pay for it when you pay for your salon services. I get into Nicques chair and she's awesome! Easy to talk to and very knowledgeable. We did a vintage updo and it took about 1 1/2 hour. She's very detailed and passionate about her work. I decided to book my bridal party and self for my October wedding. I'm escorted to the front desk and get prepared to pay. I add a 20 tip for Nicque and I'm told the trial will be $80 instead of $50 because it was a detailed style. No biggie I hand over my gift card and the lady at the register said it wasn't working. She goes and speaks to the manager/owner and comes back and tells me unfortunately it was for hair extensions not the service I received. I end up paying $104 for a hair consult. I'm annoyed but pay. I leave sit in my car and look at the gift card. It states: To Bride- from: terri- $50- bride consult. So I go back in. I say that I'm not trying to make a big fuss but I'm left with a bad taste that this gift card is being refused when it does not state that it can only be used for extensions. The owner/manager comes out. She explains to me that this gift card is for another service and she's sorry about the miss communication but I should have let them know prior to my service that I had a gift card and the gift card says Terri but Nicque did my hair. She then tells me how nice my hair is. I am not arguing that I like my hair I'm arguing that the gift card is being refused! She talked down to me and told me she wasn't really sure what I was wanting her to do. I get upset and start to get teary eyed. This is customer service 101 I'm about to bring 4-5 bridesmaids to get salon and she's fighting me for $50! She tells me that she feels bad about the miscommunication. She then tells me that she can meet me halfway and give me $25 off on my wedding day. She states that she thinks that's fair since the gift card is for a completely different service. I just stand there tears falling down my face because I'm so infuriated. She also jokes that if they gave every bride at the expo a $50 gift card they'd not be in business. I wasn't looking for the style to be free. I wanted the gift card to be honored. She should have done the right thing and honored it. I was called after I left and my sweet stylist Nicque offered to honor the gift card on my wedding day. I now however have such a bad taste for this and I absolutely do not want to support the owner of the salon. It sucks because I loved my hair but you never argue with a customer. Also don't hand out fake gift cards that mean nothing! I left in tears furious that I spent that much for a trial and will be expected to pay more on my wedding day. They should have their pricing written down and be clear about what youre paying for.",negative
Kudos to Gaby who did an amazing job with my hair!!! I love the refreshing new look she gave and the professional subtle atmosphere that lingers in the place! Now I'm a regular client!,positive
"One phrase to describe my most recent hair experience: Pinterest Worthy! Kasondra did an amazing job creating the perfect bayalage summer hair. She is a great stylist for curly hair, and knows how to cut it perfectly every time. If you're in Tempe looking for a great stylist and salon, definitely give Altered Ego a call!",positive
"I get my hair colored and cut by Mylisa and I get my extensions done by Terri! They are both amazing and know exactly what I want! I have very fine, thin hair and they know what will look good with my hair and what won't. Terri has been doing my extensions for almost two years now and she customizes them for my hair. Makes the bond smaller so they will lay very flat and so they won't be noticeable. They look very natural! No one knows they are extensions and are very shocked when I tell them that they are! She is amazing! Mylisa is amazing with balayage and color! She has been doing mine for a while now. I love how sun kissed it looks! Perfect for summer!",positive
Mylisa was my styalist and she was amazing!! She was great to take to and did amazing work! I got a grey/silver all over and couldn't have asked for better!! If you're wanting anything a little crazy or colorful I would HIGHLY recommend her!!,positive
"This was my first trip to this salon. I decided to head over to this salon just because of the amazing Yelp reviews. To say the least; my fellow Yelpers never let me down. From the jump my experience was amazing! The ladies that helped me to book my appointment took the time to listen to what I wanted and where I currently was with my hair to match me up with hands down the most personable super talented stylist. Ms Timiko! Forgive me if I'm spelling your name wrong... Not only does she take time to listen to what I wanted, she took time to explain what would look the best on me and how she planned on accomplishing that look. She went above and beyond what any other stylist has done for me in the past. Talk about raising the bar! I'm soooooo happy with my new haircut and I sooo enjoyed all the laughs and great conversation with Timiko. I also enjoyed a hot skinny Vanilla latte that was made for me less than a few feet away while I was getting my hair done. The coffee joint is inside of this salon. A fabulous cut, tasty latte, and fantastic company to boot. Doesn't get much better than this thank you !!!!",positive
"We are spending a few months in the Mesa / Tempe area and I'd decided to get my long hair cut. On the recommendation of two friends I went to a stylist at another salon. I was really disappointed with that experience and the cut, even though I'd showed her three pics of what I was wanting. I found Altered Ego here on Yelp and was able to get an appointment with Tiffany. I showed her the same pics I'd showed the other stylist and she ""got it""! She did a great job cutting my hair and I will be going back to her next time we're here! The whole salon experience was fantastic! Thanks for rescuing me Tiffany!",positive
"I've been searching for a hair stylist ever since I moved to the PHX valley 5 years ago. YIPPEE!!!! I found her!!!! Kassondra is incredible! She's great w/ color & I hardly have to spend any time on my hair due to it FINALLY being cut properly. Once again I am getting compliments on my hair & people asking....""Who's your stylist?"" Great color, great cut.....one happy girl I am! Thx Kassondra!!",positive
"Decided to take a closer look at Altered Ego after reading their overwhelmingly positive reviews here on Yelp. It is also less than a ten-minute drive from my home. I made a trial appointment for an updo with Tawni, the owner. She specializes in updos, and I wanted to look ""done-up"" but still like me for my elopement. Tawni TOTALLY delivered! The day of the trial, we chatted about my ideas, and I showed her a Pinterest pin board I had created. We went off of one key pin, and Tawni played around with the style. Then she took tons of photos on her iPhone and emailed them to me so I could process the hairstyle at home over the next week. I decided that I wanted even more curls/texture/volume, and that I wanted the fishtail braid a bit longer than in our trial. The morning of my elopement, Tawni opened her shop EARLY for me. My hair was ABSOLUTELY PERFECT. The photos I attach will do most of the talking, but I must say that this was a fantastic experience. Tawni was exceptionally professional, as was her assistant (Megan?). They had huge smiles on their faces the entire time my hair was being done; it felt SO good to know that I was in good hands, and that these professionals truly love what they do. I would recommend any bride-to-be to check out Altered Ego and to consult with Tawni on the style you've been dreaming of. THANK YOU!

Great Salon! They do great work and have really fun events! I highly recommend Topher! He is fabulous at what he does!!!!,positive
I love this Salon! It has an awesome atmosphere and great stylists. I would highly recommend Topher. Not only did he give me an amazing cut but he also gave me tips on how to style my hair. After informing him that most days I choose extra sleep over styling he taught me how to do a ten minute blow dry. I have been doing it this past week and I am impressed with how much better my hair looks!,positive
"I am very particular when it comes to my hair and after moving to Arizona it was my mission to find a place i could go to and leave feeling great about my hair. I went to other salons before finding Altered Ego, and I have to say I wish I found Alter Ego first!! I made an appointment and was introduced to Topher. I gave a brief sentence on how I usually cut my hair and Topher went to work. He knew exactly what I wanted from a few words. It is hard to find a salon and hair stylist that can understand their clients needs from a few words. With Topher there was no issue. I can honestly say that every time I go in for a hair cut with Topher I leave knowing my hair will look amazing. Definitely the place to go if you want great service and an amazing haircut.",positive
Tiffany the nail tech at Altered Ego is amazing and does an excellent job with both manis and pedis. She is very precise in her work and is focused on what the customer wants. I have been going to Tiffany for 4+ years and I couldn't be happier!,positive
"I moved from out of state a little over a year ago and found Tina as my hairstylist! Normally it takes me a couple of tries with a stylist before finding one who truly knows how to work with my red coarse/curly hair, but with finding Tina, I never needed to try elsewhere. She is AMAZING with color. She found the perfect 2 colors that complement my natural red and I love it! I am constantly getting compliments while out and about on my hair color. Tina definitely knows how to make your hair look great!!",positive
I have seen Tiffany for a little over a year and she has been my saving grace for my nails! Such a sweet and outgoing women! The salons energy is upbeat and extremely fun! All of the staff is efficient and friendly. I was in love with this place from the first time I went! Outstanding!,positive
I absolutely loved this salon! I went with my sister to her hair appointment because she was nervous to try a new place. When we got there we were actually greeted by the stylist KASONDRA and she was incredibly sweet and energetic. She accommodated me and made sure I was comfortable even though I was not her client. The damask decorations and fun upbeat music was an added plus. I loved it there so much that I traveled from Peoria to Tempe again the next week so that Kasondra could cut my hair too. She did such a thorough an fantastic job on both mine and my sisters hair that I will be continuing to drive and hour just to see her! I'm going to get my hair colored by her next so I will add to my review with comments from that too :),positive
Went for months - I have baby fine wavy hair so no texturizing - apparently this is not something they understand as I left in July with a head full of texture - never went back.,negative
"After much stylist turmoil and almost a year without a haircut because I was in denial I came to yelp and found Altered Ego. It's close to my house and had great reviews. I booked an appointment with Marla and went in for a much shorter cut. She took her time and made sure it was what I wanted. Several hours after my appointment I realized that I just didn't like it. For the first time in my life I called and asked if I could come back to have some adjustments made. Marla made time the same day and gave the cut more ""wow"" and an edgier flare. She followed up with me TWICE to make sure I still liked it. The final product was fabulous and I have received many compliments on my new ""do"". I will be returning for furture cuts!",positive
"I went to this salon yesterday, and Billy booked me last minute because I could not stand one more day with my hair or I was going to cut it myself. LOL. Amor was kind enough to stay late to accomodate my haircut and color. I really had no idea what kind of color I wanted so Amor helped me choose a brown that was a bit lighter than my mousey hair. Only, once it was on, it had a very orangish tint. So she went back and put a toner on it and it helped calm down some of the brassiness (sp?) However, its still kinda orange, when I ask my friends what color my hair is...they say...""hmmmm I can't put my finger on it. It looks good though!"" I think I will wait a few days to see how it sets...I think it will work out great. The best part though is my haircut. I LOVE IT! I have thick hair that cannot be touched with thinning shears, Amor really took her time to make sure all my layers flow seamlessly together, and she thinned my hair using regular scissors. It has been a long time since I have had such a great hair cut. It usually comes out disjointed and frizzy, and blunt looking. Overall I had a great experience, and will definately come back to see Amor in the future. Oh I saw some lady get a spray tan...it looked so real! I think I will have to try that out too.",positive
"Unfortunately, my hair stylist from hair pollution, Darcy, moved up to north Scottsdale and this would have been too much of the commute for me so i had to start looking for a new place and stylist. This place is absolutely awesome, the staff is super friendly and were kind enough to accommodate my sister who just needed her ends trimmed, oh and the stylist didn't even charge her for it! Anyways, they took me in right away and my hair stylist Rebecca is this cute brunette with long locks and I have long hair so I was very comfortable with her cutting my hair. She washed, cut, and styled my hair in 45 minutes and my hair looked fabulous and healthy oh and the price wasn't bad to boot! This is my new place!",positive
"I received my first haircut here as a curly girl! Terri cut my hair, using the Deva technique ( wedge cut). Of course I was a bit nervous at first--but after having a short consultation with her before having my hair cut I was totally comfortable. I loved the results and she even told me to come back if I had any straggly ends. I love everything about this salon, everyone is friendly, unlike some salons, where you walk in and the shop goes completely silent. LOL. The owner is awesome too! THANKS TERRI!",positive
"GREAT SALON! I was looking for a fresh new haircut and one the the stylist, Tyler Colman, helped me out with the exact look I was going for. Ask for Tyler, he is a super hip guy that knows about the latest styles and is very experienced.",positive
"Stephanie is the best! I have extremely thick, curly hair and she always trims it perfectly for me. I even trusted her with shaving my undercut a while back. She comes up with the best designs to shave and the cutest colors to dye. Whether your hair is curly or straight, you want a cut or color or just a wash, Stephanie is your girl",positive
"I have now been coming to Amazing Cuts for about a year or so. Every single time I've come, I've had a different stylist work on me. I have yet to have a single experience where i didn't leave with a smile on my face. Each stylist, including the manager or owner or so friendly. They say goodbye, and call you out by your name. They look you in the eye and treat you with respect. This place opens up early too. 8:00 or 8:30 am at the latest. They are open 7 days a week. They have high quality work. And to add a cherry to the top of the sundae, they are extremely affordable. They make it easy for this goofy looking guy to feel good. Thanks Amazing Cuts!!",positive
Steph has been doing my hair for years. She does any hair type and isn't afraid to do some crazy colors. Highly recommend this salon. Then entire staff is super friendly and inviting. It is easier to make an appointment as the salon stays busy all day.,positive
"Being going here for a year now and I haven't got a bad haircut yet. Anesia always leaves me with a perfect fade/cut that I get on a weekly basis. All the staff here are friendly, remember your name, and make sure your appointments are accurate. I highly recommend this place to anyone, both male and female, who value their hair and appearance!",positive
"I love this place, my son found it with his friends and he is very picky with his hair. I finally gave it a try and love it, I got hair and color. Took me forever to find a place I like.",positive
Go see Misty at Amazing Cuts. I've followed Misty from another salon and wouldn't let anyone else cut my hair. She is knowledgeable and professional all the time and is always has a great attitude.,positive
"Amber did a last minute cut and beard trim on my husband and it is fabulous! He gets so many compliments and I love it. She got us in the same day and we couldn't be happier. She'll definitely be his go to stylest! Ryan also got me in last minute for a women's cut. I got an aline bob and didn't want to lose any length because I'm growing out a Mohawk. She was awesome and understood exactly what I wanted. My hair is healthy and now has a cute style with clean ends. She's definitely my new stylest! The place is clean, modern, and extremely well priced! You can't go wrong here.",positive
"I've been going there for about 2 years now. I've gone through several stylist and they all were good, but then I discovered Darian she's the best! Great Charming attitude always makes sure that you're satisfied with your haircut, and cuts it the way you want, doesn't rush.",positive
"I came in today on the verge of tears with a hair emergency. My dry damaged frizzy hair was out of control and I was slated to give a talk in the morning. Darion was a miracle worker! She took her time and did an incredible job treating and styling my hair, even going so far as to make sure it looked just as nice the next day. She's easy to talk to and wise beyond her years. I highly recommend her as a stylist and a person.",positive
"I took my 4 yr old here for her first hair cut . It was busy, but they got us to someone with in 10 mins. Her name I believe was Taylor she was very nice. My daughter has an extremely soft head and very rough hair to brush bc of the curls but she did it so gently my daughter didn't cry or fidget. It was quick and easy . She recommended products outside their store for a hopefully easier experience when we brush it. Will deff go back.",positive
"Unprofessional I won't spend my money here again!Over a year ago I had my hair done by Jessica she damaged my hair so bad I had to cut my hair to my Collarbone and my hair was under my shoulder blades. I'm still trying to grow out the damage she did to my hair. Today I went to get my daughter a hair cut and the girl at the front desk remembered me and I told her about the horrible job Jessica did to my hair and that's why I haven't been back. She apologized....Then the girl went and told two other girls at the front desk and the two girls began to gossip and kept looking at me and I was staring directly at them to let them know that I see you talking, and maybe you should be professional and gossip when I leave. Then one of the girls called my daughters name and she seen it was me and looked over to the older lady with bugged out eyes and they began to gossip again as my daughter and I walked over to her. This place is so unprofessional! Your hair stylists damaged my hair so bad and you sit there and gossip and looking directly at me as your doing it with not a care..... disgusting! Great customer service.....I wish I didn't even have to give them a 1 Star!",negative
"Amber cut my hair today, she did an excellent job. I am very particular about my hair and was a little reluctant because I've never seen her work before. She made me feel very relaxed and comfortable with her pleasant personality and confident demeanor. I would recommend her to anyone sceptical about who cuts their hair. I would recommend making an appointment because she's in high demand.",positive
"My family and I have been coming here for a few years now and have always had good experiences. We now have been making appointments with Darion, she does a excellent job and always makes sure we are satisfied with our cuts. Thanks Darion, keep up the good work!",positive
"I had a few experiences here. Both times was with Vanessa!! She's awesome!! $13 for a cut and style. The first experience was with a friend of mine. She needed a haircut so we came here to amazing cuts and got Vanessa. She did an awesome job on her hair. So I decided that day that I will make an appointment to see her soon. The second time that I came was for me, I needed a haircut because I wanted to donate my hair as my hair was way too long! She did a great job cutting my hair as I showed her a picture of a hair style that I wanted and she went above my expectations of a haircut! It's been a week and I love my haircut. I will be back next time!! So will my friend as she will continue to see Vanessa!! Keep up the great work.",positive
"Great prices and products available. Janka is amazing, she color & cuts my mom, grandma and myself. She also does my husband's hair.",positive
"Wow. Amazing cut is right!! I took the advice of another fellow yelper and stopped in to this place in the hopes of getting a decent trim with no appointment totally last minute. Tall order I know, but based on the reviews I decided to give it a try. I'm super glad that I did!! I was able to be seen by Vanessa and she is so great! Super friendly, great cut and style too! I already made my appointment for color next week. Do yourself a favor and check this place out but if you want the amazing Vanessa I recommend that you make an appointment because I'm pretty sure that I just got lucky today.",positive
I have been put on hold by a snappy lady and left on hold for 1 hour and 20 minutes. Then I asked for the owner and she hung up. I called back to speak with th eowner Robert who was very rude and hung up on me too. Very unprofessional.,negative
"Great shop with $11 haircuts, good for a trim for my long hair and bangs where elsewhere it is at least $25. Cecilia helped me, took her time and made sure I was okay with what she was doing. Definitely a place I would go to again",positive
"Great customer service, close to my house and a very good haircut. Me and my 3 boys have been coming here for two years and walk out with good haircuts every time. It's hit and miss on how long the wait is and found that it's hard to predict a good time to walk-in as some weekends are busy while some are not and weekdays go the same way. Be sure to ask about the military discount. Good hair cuts at affordable prices.",positive
"It was my first time going there today because I didn't like the services from Great Clips on North Durango and also was close to my house, boy it was worth it, I get uncomfortable when I go to any haircut places because of too many eyes ha anyway, I had Jessica and she was amazing, made me felt comfortable and helped me feel calm & relax by chatting with me, she did a great job with my hair and couldn't be happier.",positive
"I been going to amazing cuts since day one, Also David has been cutting my hair and my wife for years now... All of my friends are now going to see David... I love this place....",positive
"Took both my boys for simple hair cuts. Ive driven by the spot a few times and decided to try them out. Each boy went with a different stylist. The one lady was super quick and didnt clean him up or put talc to remove the cut hair off his neck. She didnt even style his hair with gel, she just basically did a poor job. As for my other boy, the lady that cut his hair was a bit more detailed, but she still managed to give the kid a crooked part line. Looks more like a thunder bolt than a part line! LOL. With that said we probably wont be going there again.",negative
I cannot speak more highly of DAVID (the owner) He is so friendly and AWESOME. I would not take my boys ANYWHERE else. He knows EXACTLY what we like. My hair is long and getting a shampoo with a trim is the best scalp massage ever. Love this place!!,positive
"I recently let a friend currently attending beauty school make an attempt at coloring my hair. It was a terrible decision and my head looked orange and horrible. David, the owner at Amazing cuts got me in right away and did a corrective color on my hair that looked AMAZING. My cut and color were both beautiful and on top of it, my hair didn't feel completely dry from bleaching it twice and I walked away a completely satisfied customer. I cant stress enough how happy I was with the results and how much fun I had at the Salon, I will call David for all of my future coloring need.",positive
"This was the best haircut I have received in Las Vegas since I moved down here last year. if you are looking for a great place to get your haircut, look no further. The staff is friendly and they do an amazing job on your hair making you comfortable the whole time.",positive
"Close to my house, super friendly owner in David and great overall customer service. Walked right in and was taken care of immediately. Special thanks to Autumn for great friendly service and an excellent haircut.",positive
"Spotted this place on a drive by a while back and figured I'd give it a shot when it was time for a trim. It is conveniently located for me and the sign on the window says ""Haircuts $9.99."" Can't beat a cut for ten bucks, right? I almost walked out when I saw how busy they were, but decided to stick it out. I put my name on the list and rolled the dice with whoever was available next, as I didn't know anything about their stylists. It actually didn't take very long to be seated and I was soon getting my do done. Granted, there is not a whole lot of complexity when it comes to my hairdo, but Pricillia did a great job. It was one of the best cuts I've had in a while. She was attentive and got through the haircut efficiently without rushing through it, with just the right amount of conversation. All of the staff members I encountered were friendly and it was a relaxed atmosphere with music playing at a modest volume in the background. Apparently they get very busy in the afternoon and on the weekend. I was told if you want to avoid the wait, you need to plan on getting there early in the day. I will definitely be back.",positive
"this place is the only place i go for my haircuts!!! i love this place and i have been loyal to amazing cuts since it opened. I would recommend to anyone. The prices are great, it is a very clean location and David the owner is really a great guy. Dont go to another chain place but instead support a small business and go to amazing cuts!!!",positive
"Beware, I went here when this location first opened since they were having a special and a friend recommended Amazing cuts since her hair dresser for years was now the owner. I had an appointment set for my sister and I, when we got there we weren't greeted until someone just yelled for us to write our names on the bored and they'll be with us in a minute. After waiting 20 minutes I went to a gentleman (go figure was the owner) and told him that I had two appointments and we were yet to be seen or at least acknowledged. He quickly apologized and said he'd be with us once he was done with his client; mind you he was doing highlights and was in the middle of it. After another 20 minutes or so waiting we decided to just leave. The next day I had mentioned to my friend the horrible service we were given and she quickly called her friend (David the owner) and he said to come in again and wed receive a discount. After being talked into it Again my sister and I went there that very night to get our hair done. Boy were dissatisfied. Let me tell you the ""owner"" of the salon still needs more training my hair wasn't cut even and the 1 highlight I wanted in my hair after washing it once turned GREEN. My sister wasn't better off she saw someone else (don't know their names were) and her hair was just as bad. My sister which before had beautiful long hair now had orange hair and about 5 inches cut off for a Trim. Mind you after we were done and both in tears they expected us to still pay for you damaged, over processed and uneven hair. This place is joke, they can't do anything right not even customer service. Since then I have known a few other people who tried Amazing cuts to only be super disappointed and to never return. Word of mouth won't get you anywhere if you can't perform the service properly.",negative
If you want to get a crappy color job for a very cheap price this is the place to go to not only are they horrific on haircuts they're professionalism is not there at all. I tried to go to the owner my highlights were spotty and uneven all they talk about are drugs cursing and going out all the girls that were good moved away and for a reason. Priscilla was the only good one for a while but she left to Sola salon. I just don't know how they stay in business.,negative
Andrea was so amazing and really worked with me to get everything I imagined for my makeup and hair a relaity for my wedding. She did an incredible job and if I could give her 10 stars I would :),positive
"Andrea was absolutely amazing! I am so happy with her work and would recommend her to anyone wanting to look great! Thanks, Andrea!",positive
Andrea is a true artist! She had great suggestions on the best makeup for my photo shoot and I was so happy! Quick to respond and confirm our appointment. Her experience and knowledge of hair and makeup is impressive! She made me look and feel young again! Thank you.,positive
"Andrea was a superstar at our 12-hour corporate shoot today. Not only did she do a superb job with making up each of our 10 models, but has a great energy and made everyone feel totally comfortable. Thank you, Andrea!",positive
"Andrea does such amazing work. She did our hair and makeup for our family photos. She arrived on time and was very professional. My mom, sister in law, and myself we're all going for different looks and she nailed each style! I would highly recommend her! Thanks Andrea!",positive
"We flew in town for a wedding. Andrea did an amazing job on hair and makeup for my sister, mother, and myself. She was punctual, easy going, and a genius in her craft. I highly recommend her!",positive
"I found Andrea on Yelp (for my wedding) and I highly recommend her for hair and makeup! She is extremely talented, professional and yet very down to earth and friendly. I couldn't have asked for better results - she did outstanding makeup/hair for myself, my four bridesmaids and my mother. We all LOVED her!",positive
Andrea is very professional from our first phone call. She quickly understood what I wanted and was very accommodating. She was on time and we had FUN!!!!,positive
"Andrea is an extremely skillful and talented makeup artist. I recently got my makeup for my wedding photoshoot, henna party, and for the brunch after the wedding by Andrea. Several guests got their makeup applied by Andrea as well. As our wedding was heavily influenced by Indian culture (clothes, jewellery, and decor for the henna night), I felt Andrea struck a fine balance in knowing exactly what makeup would work with my skin tone and my overall outfit for the occassion. I realized Andrea is very versatile. I would recommend her instantly as I appreciate her talent, her professionalism and the fact that she is very personable and warm.",positive
Andrea did my makeup and hair awhile back with I believe a 2 day notice and was absolutely amazing. I am more of a bolder type girl and she nailed it. She also did my mother-in-law who isn't much of a make up wearer but she also loved the natural look she did on her. I have a best friend with the wedding coming up and I thought of nobody else but Andrea to do our hair and make up. She made us laugh the whole time and was such a positive energy to be around. You'd have to be silly to pass that up. A super plus was when I texted her about the wedding she was nothing but helpful giving me all the information I needed as well as being totally excited to have my business again. She is certainly personable and very professional and caring. I'm very lucky to have found her.,positive
"Andrea did an amazing job with our make up. I hired her to do make up for my mom, sisters and me for my bridal shower. I have never seen my mom so pretty before. Andrea clearly has a true gift for doing make up that lasts all day long and I didn't feel like it got caked up at all!!! The other thing that I really liked was how she did our eye make up. My eyes were my favorite part.",positive
"We just love Andrea! When you find a creative artist that can make a 50-something mom and a 17 year old teen each happy with the way they look and feel, you have an amazing stylist. We've called on Andrea on several occasions and each time we have been more than thrilled. She translates what we are looking for into a natural look. We never feel heavily ""made up"" or uncomfortable. People always genuinely compliment us after we have seen Andrea. She is very accommodating and comes to our home or location of the event. She is worth every penny. We cannot say enough good stuff about our experience! We highly recommend her!",positive
"Andrea is amazing! I found her on Yelp as I was looking for a makeup artist to do my face for my birthday party. When I found out she could do my hair AND my makeup I was sold. When I told Andrea what I envisioned for my look she was totally enthusiastic and helpful. The appointment was great. We started on time and she walked me through everything that she did. My hair ended up looking great and my makeup was flawless. She made sure to ask if I was happy with the outcome and tweaked anything I wanted. While her portfolio mainly shows natural looks, she totally achieved a glam look for me and I couldn't have been happier. Totally recommend!",positive
Andrea is awesome. 10 stars! She is friendly and made this experience super enjoyable. She gave me honest feedback on the looks I picked out. Had an amazing kit. I highly recommend her!,positive
Angela is by far the best I've seen in a long time . She's classy has flair and the-sweetest heart. I walked in a mess and walked out smiling from ear to ear . Which these days is close to impossible . Bless her for making my day,positive
"Angela is the best hairstylist I have ever been to hands down! My mom and I have been going to her for many years. Even now that I live out of state, I haven't had any other stylist do my hair. She really cares about her clients, and has the skill to make your hair look however you want, from bright purple to ombré, etc.! She is a perfectionist, too, and goes above and beyond to make her clients happy. :-)",positive
The only person I trust to do my hair. She always goes above and beyond for her clients. I've been getting color and extensions from her for years,positive
"I've been going Angela for almost a year. She's a talented stylists, colorist and knows her stuff. She takes her time and doesn't rush through any part of her service. Great personality!",positive
"Angela is wonderful, she spent so much quality time on my hair and helped me to transition from one type of extensions to the other to help me obtain my personal goal of not wearing them forever. The color is perfect, the blending of my hair and extensions is perfect. She is the best beautician I have ever been to. I will never use anyone else after the tender loving care she provided to ensure the integrity of my natural hair.",positive
"Finally got a massage and it was excellent, Natalie did an excellent job. Totally relaxed and feel so much better. I had troubles finding a good place and this place is excellent .",positive
Lisa Jacob is the best. She has been my hairdresser for the last 10 years and I will follow her here to Aqua Salon! She is always responsive to my needs and is always on time.,positive
"I have been in search of a hair stylist for years! I couldn't have been happier when I stumbled upon Lisa. She is absolutely amazing! Super friendly, funny, hospital, & (most importantly) slays my hair each and every single time I always look like total a bombshell when I step out the door! I will follow her anywhere & everywhere Call 702-807-2141 to get beautified",positive
I have been coming to Lisa Jacob for ten years and she is amazing! She has saved my hair for me many times & is amazing at color & hair cuts. She also does my moms hair & my mom loves her as well. My mom is very picky about her color & only trusts Lisa to do it. I highly recommend coming to aqua salon to see Lisa. She will make your hair look amazing!!!!!!,positive
"I get my haircut by Ashley M. The haircuts are flawless. The salon is very nice and comfortable. Also they have the best esthetician in town, Teresa A. I highly recommend both of these girls. I'm 100% satisfied.",positive
"I went here awhile ago to get a facial wax done and for 40 bucks all they do are the eyebrows, Upper lip and side burns. I looked so stupid with blotches of hair all over my face i had to go buy wax and finish the job myself! A few months later I booked an appointment to get my hair dyed not realizing it was the same place but having a wedding to go to i went in. Big Mistake! Stylist was 25 minutes late for our appointment. She colored my hair ""As light"" as she could get it then just starts chopping at my hair! I tell her i did not pay or need a haircut. She said i know im just cutting your dead ends, after cutting so much I asked her to just follow the pattern of my hair and finish the cut. (I was growing my hair out but at this point she had cut so much) I KNEW she messed up the back as far as the cut because not once did she show me the back of my hair. Which is very unusual when you get your hair done. When i got home my husband and daughter were in shock because she has butchered the back of my hair!! Not to mention I still had gray hair in the front and all over the top! I paid her 170 for this!! Never again will I give this place a chance!! I wont mention her name because she was really nice but thats it.",negative
Ashley is so awesome in her craft. She loves cutting hair and makes great conversation. She is a gem in Henderson. Get a haircut by her!!!,positive
"I had originally bought a Groupon for the tanning, I loved the tanning and it was always easy to just stop by and get in to the bed I wanted. I asked the receptionist if she had any recommendations for a nail apt, and I am so glad I made that first appointment with Cory!! It has been almost a year since she started doing my nails and I would recommend her. She listened to what I wanted, we tried a couple of different options, and she ""nailed"" it. After being in Henderson for about 2 years, I was so glad to find someone that I could make an appointment with, actually listened to what I wanted and does a great job!! I would highly recommend Cory!",positive
"Chelsea did a great job on my color, highlights & cut. I have short hair which is difficult to do. Its exactly what it should look like. Nice friendly in the shop.",positive
"Christine Costa at Aqua Salon expertly takes care of my fingernails and toenails, giving me a fresh and unique look every time. She's professional, prompt and friendly, never disrepecting my time by taking phone calls, gossiping with co-workers, or speaking in another language with someone else instead of giving her focus to the customer. She doesn't proselytize, trying to sell an agenda, but instead makes this a relaxing time for me. She always confirms the appointment and it is rare that appointments have to change, but when needed, she promptly coordinates and makes it happen. I have been her customer for over 15 years, and I've followed her all over, and will keep on doing so. Give yourself a true gift and let her take care of you! You'll never go back to the nail hack shops.",positive
"I went to see Michelle after purchasing an amazon local deal for $59.00 and it included full highlights and a hair cut. When I arrived she said she was confused booking the appt and had put me down as a men's haircut and therefore she didn't have time to do my hair. I asked if she could at least cut it and I would come back for the highlights. She agreed and proceeded to rush through a shampoo and as she sat me down in the chair she said she couldn't blow dry or style my hair and so she wouldn't take my amazon deal and she would owe me a hair cut. She then cut my long and very thick hair in about 5 mins claiming that she has been cutting hair for 10 years and can do it quickly. Before I knew it, she whipped off the apron and said call me when you want to schedule your appt and then walked straight out of the room and greeted her next client. I went home thinking that her service was terrible but if the hair cut was alright then it was OK. I blow dried my hair and realized she butchered my hair and that I would have to cut at least 3 more inches off to fix it. I called the salon to speak with a manager. They took down my name and never called back. Luckily amazon gave me my money back and I will never go there again!!",negative
Andrea is my hairstylist and she is amazing! She is very attentive and does what I ask every time. It has taken me a REALLY long time to find a good hairstylist out here and I'm so happy I finally found one. If you book an appointment with Andrea you will not be disappointed!,positive
Was looking for a new salon. The customer service was great here and I loved the new color of my hair! I would definitely recommend this place to friends.,positive
"This is an amazing salon. They have friendly very qualified staff. Its is extremely spacious, and VERY clean. I recommend this salon for hair and tanning its amazing. So nice having a great local salon that I can trust with my hair.",positive
"I made a appointment for the same day while visiting Vegas. I saw some good reviews on stylists here so decided to give it a go. I asked for Kerri, Ashley or one of their best. The girl said Shelby was good had worked there a long time and done hair a long time. I got there and told Shelby I was in serious need of a mini makeover. Darken my base color add blonde highlights and give me a new hairstyle that was sassy. She said absolutely. She showed me a color chart and I picked a medium brown. I was there for over two hours and when she was done I looked exactly the way I did when I walked in. She barely trimmed some ends of my hair while the base was the about the same blonde I had. Then she added highlights that were almost same color as the base. Worst rip off I've had. $130 for nothing.",negative
Marissa Turgeon has been our stylist for a year- myself and my 2 daughters. I get highlights & haircuts and my kids get haircuts- we all love Marissa! She is friendly and never cuts too much length if we don't want her to. If we want to figure out a new style or how to keep our hair looking nice during a grow out time she gives suggestions based on our hair type and amount of time we want to spend styling.,positive
Marissa is my stylist and she does an amazing job. She is a great communicator and really listens to her clients. She is a very bright individual who is knowledgable about the ins and outs of hair styling. She regularly attends hair shows to maintain a high level of skill. I have been going to her for years and Aqua Salon treats her and the clients very well!,positive
I usually go here to tan and they are very nice with great prices so I thought id try a haircut. I don't remember the lady's name but she took an hr to cut it and then style it I was headed to work so I didn't have time to play with it much after it was until the next day that I washed it I noticed how bad the cut was I was so embarrassed to wear it simply straight because you could notice the uneven cut I had asked for a U -V cut and when I asked for a refund and showed them pictures they said they would call me back and ask the manager they ended up refunding me but the graceful tip I had left stay with the highly inexperienced stylist .by the way I had taken 4 inches off I don't even go tan there anymore because it was so disappointing pictures are in next review (red hair),negative
This was my first time to this salon yesterday. I had a Groupon and thought I'd give it a try. Ashley was my stylist. She did an amazing job. I walked out super satisfied. The salon is really pretty inside. I can't wait to try the tanning salon this summer.,positive
"Wanted to try out a new salon close to home. Groupon had $25 special that Aqua honored without having to buy a Groupon. You get what you pay for. We booked 2 appointments yesterday. I had Julia and she did a decent job on my hair. Nothing too complicated, just trim and layers cleaned up. Overall, a nice experience. My wife had Ashley and we were told that she had experience. Her haircut was a disaster. Apparently it was Ashley's first day at this salon after taking a hiatus from styling. My wife wanted to cry afterwards because her beautiful long hair was hacked up and the expensive ombre she had gotten months ago was completely chopped off. She asked for a trim of no more than 2 inches and ended up having 5.5 inches taken off. She kept reminding Ashley that she didn't want her length taken off but Ashley kept cutting anyways. She appeared out of her element and we noticed that even the more experienced stylist looked on in horror at what she was doing to my wife's hair. All the while, a very annoying and pushy man kept taking her scissors to sharpen them...IN THE MIDDLE OF A HAIRCUT?!?! Well, we learned our lesson in getting what we paid for. Never again.",negative
"Purchased a groupon for cut, full highlight and conditioning. They booked me with Shelby, so I proceeded to explain that I like my blonde highlights BLONDE not apricot, not caramel but blonde. She seemed to understand and after talking with her we agreed that I only needed partial highlights. So she went on to say that they bleach she used has a toner in it but if my blonde came out too brassy she would put more toner on it. She said that normally toner was an extra $10 but since I paid for full highlights and was only getting partial she wouldn't charge me for it. WELL, I left there extremely brassy, she didn't offer to put toner on it and I honestly don't think I got any special conditioning treatment! She is the ""professional"" so she should have realized it needed toning I shouldn't have to point it out! Live and learn!",negative
"I had a Groupon and the salon is close to my house. The Groupon price package made it worth a try. The first time the ""new"" receptionist gave me the wrong girl's name for highlights but that was straightened out. I ended up with Julia and with my pictures of the haircut, I pretty much got what I wanted. It was okay. The second time I had a pedicure and then another Groupon haircut price package. The pedicure made me have sore feet and a cut on the side of my foot. Never again on the pedicure. I had to walk 3 days on sore feet in downtown Vegas showing company in town for the week.",negative
"Had a HAIRCUT/SHAMPOO/STYLE for both myself and my 7 year old daughter by Marissa. I loved the decor of the salon and I was greeted quickly by the staff upon arriving. I went first while my daughter read her book on a massaging chair that she thought was so cool. This was the first time for my daughter to get the special treatment. Marissa was so patient with her as she kept striking poses in the mirror, very pleased with how she looked. My daughter had an Gymnastic tournament and Marissa curled and put her hair up for the event. This is the best she has ever looked since I don't know how to style hair. For me, I couldn't be happier. Marissa took time going over my current cut and making suggestions to me what she thought while listening to my requests. I am very pleased how my hair and my daughter's hair turned out. I will go back for sure.",positive
"I have been going to Horizon Sun/ Aqua Salon for about 6 years now and have NEVER found a salon in Henderson that can compare. I was born in Henderson and my mom owned a salon here as I was growing up, so I have seen my fair share of Henderson salons. Not only do they offer every service you could ever want, the staff is extremely friendly and welcoming. My hair stylist is amazing (Kerri Hunsaker, soon to be Torrez!) I would have to say my most FAVORITE service is the spray tans by Stefanie Williams. I have been a bed tanner forever and have recently been turned on to these personal spray tans. They are amazing! It is the exact, even color I have been trying to achieve for YEARS! Stefanie makes me feel comfortable during the sessions and makes it easy to book. I could go on and on for days about Aqua! Love, love, love this salon! I would recommend Aqua to everyone, and I do!!",positive
"I purchased a Groupon Now for a massage, to be redeemed before 9 PM. I called for nearly a half an hour and received a busy signal on their line. Finally the receptionist picked up and said she would call me right back. A half an hour later I called to follow up and they said that their massage therapist was not working that night. So, I basically wasted an hour of my time trying to get a hold of them based on a Groupon that they posted to generate business.",negative
"I'm not impressed with Aqua at all. Not the location. The atmosphere, the product they carry, that it's attached to a tanning salon, the people who work there. None of it! I ONLY go here & I ONLY gave it 5 stars because this is where my trusted stylist works. She was my stylist elsewhere & I moved to Phoenix for a year. When I moved back I tracked her down to Aqua. Ask for Chelsea. She's awesome!!",positive
I get my hair done by Lacey every 4 weeks and she is AMAZING! I was nervous to go to someone new since I had been going to the same stylist for most of my life. Lacey is so personable. She's very kind and sweet and her work is amazing! She cuts my hair exactly how I ask and she is very precise. We have done quite a few different things with the color of my hair and I have been absolutely in love with it every time! I also bought my boyfriend a facial and a massage for Christmas and he loved it! The prices are very reasonable and you get your money's worth. I highly recommend Aqua salon and Lacey.,positive
"I went recently for a massage that I had purchased thru Living Social or Groupon. My masseuse was very sweet but the rub was just so so. Maybe she's new to the industry and needs to hone her skills a little. I'm not really sure. I requested firmer pressure but received light pressure. My guess is that they want to up-sell you to a deep tissue which in actuality is an entirely different massage. Swedish, firm pressure shouldn't be an additional charge. Anyway, the massage was ok but not at all memorable and my muscles really didn't get worked. Beyond that, the room was freezing cold. There should be a small heater in the room and a table warmer at a minimum to ensure client comfort. A little bummed as I was hoping for more.",negative
"DO NOT GO TO THIS PLACE!!! HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE!!! I'm from San Francisco, and came to Las Vegas to spend the weekend with my mother-in-law. I decided it would be nice to take her to a salon, and have her get a facial, and I was gonna get my haircut and colored. (Bonding experience) Thinking ahead, I made the appointment about a month in advance, and was very excited to go. The day came around, and that morning I called the salon around 10:30 to confirm both of our appointments and they said we were both still scheduled for 2:00pm. So that afternoon we drove about half an hour to this place (because from the yelp reviews, it sounded the best in Henderson....boy was I wrong) and got there and they told me the girl doing the facials had a ""family emergency in California"" and they had nobody to cover. Now...when there is an emergency, isn't it the first priority to call that persons appointments for the day and let them know this?!?!? DID I RECEIVE A CALL? NOOO! When asked why they didn't call me they laughed and said they didn't have my phone number? HOW DO YOU NOT HAVE MY PHONE NUMBER? I GAVE IT TO THEM 3 TIMES!!! I can tell you what really happened, the lady that did the facials came in on a friday morning, worked until noon, and decided she didn't want to hang out any more and told the front reception to make up a good excuse for her! What really irritated me was the fact that there was 4 girls standing at the front desk, and they all laughed when I checked in. Personally, losing $300 from 2 clients isn't something I would laugh about if I worked there. Needless to say I walked out and didn't have my hair done because I was so irritated, and didn't feel like carrying on a happy conversation with the hair stylist. I'm sorry these girls didn't have what it took to make it on the strip, so they decided to become an esthetician.",negative
"I've been a client of aqua salon since they have opened. Actually had a tanning membership before they had the salon! Not only is the front desk staff the friendliest I've ever encountered, but I always walk out with a smile on my face! Shelley, my hair stylist always makes sure I am 110% satisfied when I walk out the door! The owners are friendly and it has a very family like atmosphere! I really don't understand how anyone could be unsatisfied with any service unless your just a miserable and unhappy person by nature! My girlfriend and I have had every service they provide, with the exception of the massage which I've heard from many is AMAZING and a great deal! Keep up the good work aqua! If I could give more than 5 stars I would!",positive
"Theres something to be said about old school, no nonsense barbershops...I've been searching for a good barber since I've moved back to TO in February and I think I may have found it. I came here on the recommendation of a friend and was very happy with my experience! You walk in and see two older gentleman who have been barbers for 50+yrs...check one for experience. I was a little concerned that they wouldn't be able to give me an updated cut but I was pleasantly surprised..shame on me for passing judgment. I was greeted by a very nice man - Tito who has been barbering for 50+yrs and been with the company for 13yrs - he advised me that they take CASH ONLY, which was fine with me. They only take walk ins but the wait wasn't too long - I went Saturday at around 12:15pm, and right after I walked in it started to get busy...I waited about 20mins or so, not too bad. Tito took his time to understand exactly what it was I wanted and constantly checked in with me, and also offered his opinion about certain styles. He took about 45-1hr to give me a cut and beard trim which cost me $40 + tip - about what I would pay at other hipster joints. I was considering getting a shave but he said that its an extra $12 and would take an extra 30mins or so, so I passed...considering it for next time though All in all, If you're looking for a old school, high quality cut with fantastic conversation then this is DEFINITELY the place to go!! Haircut: $28 Beard cut: $12 Shave: $12 I'll see you in a couple weeks - Thanks Tito!",positive
"I took my boyfriend here,, wanting to try out something new like downtown style .. new trend,new style. Didnt have to explain much, the stylist did an excellent job,.. me and my boyfriend were really happy and satisfied with the make over.. amazing staff and excellent service.",positive
"Probably the worst haircut I've had. Found this place on Yelp and decided to give it a try. An older Chinese lady gave me the cut. Very basic short-hair look and she couldn't complete the job without leaving an obvious uneven part seen from the front. For $27, to not even be able to get the most basic cut, is very disappointing. Not to mention that the price was just for the cut, no shampooing or styling. I might add that one of the scissors that they used even seemed dull. If there's anything nice to say, the lady was very friendly and chatty. If you do decide to visit this place, definitely try a different hair stylist.",negative
"Friendly guys and ok haircuts but they talk so much they're half as quick as someone at Terminal or other pro shops. Price is consistent with other shops downtown. Cleanliness is not the best. Feels like it's in need of a revamp and a manager to crack the whip. If you've got an hour to wait around and you like to talk a lot, maybe it's a good place. If you're busy and want a primo haircut quick, there are far better choices.",negative
"I might be biased because I really like the folks that work here. They're all very nice, genuine people that enjoy a good chat. The shop is pretty standard fare. A couple chairs to be sheared in, a couple chairs to wait in and a bunch of men's magazines. Maxim and car magazines I mean. The photos on the wall for style suggestions are priceless and go way back for a nice nostalgic kick but if you're really there for a proper barbershop cut, clean and short is the order of the day. It can get really busy at lunch time as the area is filled with offices on all sides so if you're going to go I find the best time is after the lunch rush around 1:30 or so.",positive
"I have gotten my hair cut here over the past two years and have never had a bad experience. Don't let the name fool you, this place is more 'barber shop' than 'hair stylings' (that's a good thing!) The inside is nice and there is plenty of reading material to peruse while you wait your turn (no appointments here, just first come first serve). Usually I hate making awkward small chat with the person cutting my hair, but there are two older gentlemen who work here who are a pleasure to chat with. At $21 for a hair cut this place is great. They also offer other services such as a wet shave (I have never had the pleasure of having one, maybe one day.) They are open until 6pm Monday to Friday and 5:30pm on Saturday. I would definitely recommend Aristotelis!",positive
I had an amazing body exfoliation & facial from Marissa. So relaxing from beginning to end!!! Highly recommend Marissa for services she was all around great!,positive
"The salon pricing is not worth the quality of styling. I have not gotten my hair cut there but I have gotten it styled for weddings twice. Both times my hair did not look much like the picture I showed them. Most of the other bridesmaids also said that their hair did not look like the picture they showed them. I liked the make up but I was not told the price of the fake eyelashes before they charged me for them and put them on. After they put them on I found out it was about $40 for the lashes and $15 to ""put them on""... I could have bought drug mart eyelashes for $5. My hair fell out long before the end of the day and it did not hold up for pictures. The stylists were nice and the wedding coordinator is very nice.. but I would not recommend for any wedding parties.. It just doesn't seem like the stylists are very experienced and the salon is not worth the prices.",negative
"Absolutely amazing experience! I moved to the Cleveland area a year ago from Columbus, and didn't realize there was an Aveda salon close enough to me. I had gone to another Westlake salon once last summer, and it left me unimpressed. I went to Arz, and I am so glad I found it! Lauren did an amazing job taking me from long hair to a great short hair cut! I've never gone short like this, and she kept asking my opinion and making me comfortable with it the whole time. My hair looks awesome, and everyone that's seen it loves it! Everyone at the salon was so nice, I've found my salon up here!",positive
I went here for a pedicure. It was fabulous! I was looking for a salon that did not smell of too many chemicals and this was just perfect! They use Aveda products. Salon is very well laid out. A few stations for every service. Lindsey did my nails and she did an amazing job. Very thorough and meticulous. All the staff was friendly and made for a very welcoming environment. Will definitely recommend!,positive
Went to Brianna for a Brazilian. She did the service in 30 minutes flat and it was virtually painless. Plus she's so nice and she made me feel comfortable. I definitely will go back.,positive
"I went here after moving to town off a recommendation from a friend, and I was very happy. The prices are very reasonable but it's a little far of a drive. I recommend Isabel, she does a great job and listens to what you want...",positive
"I had a wonderful day of pampering here! I got a haircut and a facial, back to back. Only down side is that it takes a lot longer than a typical appt because, after all, they are students and evaluation is part of the process. I wasn't sure if they would be giving all the complimentary treatments at the institute but they did! My stylist gave me a chair massage, hand massage and offered a mini facial. She washed my hair and gave me a choice of products to try (no up charge!). I asked to have my hair thinned and a supervisor came over to do that at the end. It was a great experience! The facial was perfect. I had asked for extractions which my esthetician did but they don't remove milia so that was disappointing (not her fault though). She offered to talk me through each step or just let me relax and I appreciated that. I opted to relax! My esthetician had a soft touch and soothing voice. I thought it might not be very relaxing because it's in a large room divided with hospital room curtains, lights dimmed and candles everywhere. With the peaceful music playing, I didn't hear anyone else even though I know there were other clients and students in the adjoining spaces. The facial started with a foot consultation (basically a foot wash) as well as an arm and chest massage during the service. It was great! Afterwards, there is a touch up bar for sunscreen, cheek color, etc. All in all, it was $75 for something that would normally be closer to $200. It did take 3.5 hours for both services. It's located in a strip mall so plenty of parking. They offer tea and water and sell their full product line. No tipping allowed.",positive
"No you're wrong. I was actually a student here. And for the most part ALLLL OF THE SHEETS were stained AFTER washing. Including the towels. ALSO! We did go 3 months without laundry detergent. That is super disgusting and unsanitary. If I could get my tuition back I would without hesitation. It's really sad how you guys cheat the ""customers""",negative
"I've been here 2x for blowouts and deep conditioning treatments . First time it was the girls first time ever doing a blowout so it took 2 hours . Second time I called And asked for a senior who would be graduating . Alex did a scalp treatment and deep conditioning and blowout . Alex did a great job and she was a natural . She was very soothing and sweet . It was so cheap too, $25 after I unlocked the Yelp 20% off . I've never had a color or cut because everyone screws up my hair when they have 10 yrs or more experience, so I would never trust a newbie . But overall I liked the Aveda school .",positive
"My facial with Evelyn was excellent. She was caring, knowledge and catered to my skins needs. I didn't even think she was a student but a professional. Thank you for making my skin glow.",positive
"I'm a few weeks late but Crystal M was amazing! I love my haircut and I got soooo many compliments! I really felt like she cared what I wanted and she did such an incredible job! I'm a super happy client, will be back again!",positive
"I would like to preface this with the fact that I emailed Aveda guest services about my negative experience, and weeks later, I've never even received a response. That being said, I had the worst possible experience during my visit a few weeks ago. I realize that the stylists on the floor are still learning, and although I have a tremendous amount of patience, I still expect a certain amount of professionalism from my student. I did not have an appointment, but was happy to get in as a walk-in. I was assigned to Mark. I wouldn't have actually known his name since he never told me, and I had just overheard it from others. From the very start, I was never offered any rituals. I explained to him what kind of cut I wanted and he said he understood. His teacher came by, and when she asked if he had given me my ritual, he said that I just wanted the haircut. Okay.... He shampooed me very roughly and many times kept stabbing me in my ears with his fingers then laughed about it. He used many curse words while talking with me, he told me all about the crazy old ladies he has to service, and kept cutting me off anytime he would ask me a question. It was very apparent that he was going to cut my hair how he wanted it, with or without my input. When he was ""finished"" and I expressed to him that it wasn't what I wanted, he continued to tell me how I needed to style it and that if I cut it the way I wanted it, I would look BAD. Excuse me? Thank heavens for the teacher who noticed how uncomfortable I was with the situation. She came over and asked him to shampoo me again and she would show him how to do the cut. I then got the roughest shampoo, yet again, and back to the chair. The teacher was very thorough, and took great consideration for what I wanted. Meanwhile, this Mark character sat next to us complaining that he had been there for 2 hours with me to his buddies. He didn't pay any attention to his teacher who was trying to help him at all. In the end, the teacher (I wish I knew what her name was), did an excellent job with my hair, and I love the cut! I wish I could have her attention-to-detail all the time. Mark decided to take a video of my hair, without even asking me, to post on his instagram, even though he didn't even cut it!!! If I can report the instagram photo, I will. I would like to say that I'll return again, but I seriously hope that issues like this are addressed. I would rather spend my money somewhere else for actual pampering and relaxation than take a chance with getting someone who clearly doesn't get it, again.",negative
This place is Sth else. I came here for a blow dry and style and they assigned me a guy to do my hair. I am very intuitive and I felt he was going to mess up my hair and I was totally right! He was extremely slow and took more than an hr to dry my hair and it turned out that it was still wet. I highly doubt that if they really teach their students here. I feel so regret to come here and maybe I was just in a very bad luck. I think their instructors need to be more responsible and teach their students what to do to their customers. No one wants to pay for bad service. It was my first time here and it's going to be my last time!,negative
"I just moved from South Pasadena, CA and wanted to advance my career and just so happen to be paying cash because my Dad agreed to pay for my schooling. I called to inquire about the Aveda program and a lady in charge(can't remember her name but I believe it was Gale or Debra?) of admission seemed very sweet so I was excited. I had an appointment scheduled and was assured that I'd be reminded. Unfortunately I got no reminder call and everything hit me all at once that day and ended up missing my appointment by mistake. When I finally remembered and called the next day, she was very curt, rude, and unhappy to talk to me. I was devastated as Aveda was my top tier choice in what school I was picking. When I asked to speak with John the owner, I got the run around and could not get to him directly. I finally gave up and am looking for another school. Super disappointed with Aveda.",negative
"I love this place ! It was my first time here and it was great . I came for a haircut, my girl was April she was great . The cut was $19... $19!!!, you get a wash a facial a massage and a style . I will definitely be back ! Next time I think I will get a color . And I found my new go to hair products !",positive
"Well having loved Aveda in the ABQ I figured I'd go to the one in Vegas. How different could it be? Surprise it was very different. I waited for my person in the lobby and then he came out ... This very tall and robust guy who was overly friendly. A queen if I ever saw one. Then he started with the touching. I don't like strangers touching me, sorry not my cup of tea. I don't know you, keep your hands to yourself. So he washed my hair and asked me a thousand questions. Finally the blow out.. I told him that my hair was not dry. He then put some cream on my head to settle down the flyaways ... Long story short .. Upon Checking out I told the front desk that my hair was not dried properly. They said they would have the teacher come out. The teacher was also very touchy! WTF? She did take me back and finished the job. But jeeze all that touching and all those questions? I'm done with this place. No thanks. And I won't even talk about the strong up sell. Yikes this place was weird with a touch of inappropriate behavior.",negative
"I come here usually every week to get my hair done, simply blowout or blowout with flat irons. Pretty clean establishment, but sometimes it can be a little chaotic. I get my hair done by Tacari who does an amazing, professional job every time. It's a very convenient place for people have busy fluctuating schedules like myself, which is why I choose Aveda. Front desk needs work and organization, so don't be surprised if your appointment isn't booked, cancelled, or incorrect. Lots of potential for this establishment, but needs apparent leadership. I will continue to come to Aveda, despite all reoccurring booking issues.",positive
"Got my hair colored. Got a massage, a mini facial and great color. All my friends tell me that my color looks so natural. Also had a great blow out. will definitely come back",positive
"My first time there today! They squeezed me in for same day appt. it was such an amazing experience! Excellent quality work very focused on quality. They offer you tea or coffee upon arrival. After that you get your hair washed and have ""rituals"" done which includes a hand massage, mini facial, neck message and hair cut with style....all for 19 bucks!!!!!!!! My student Lupe did such an awesome job with my hair and the instructor Phillip was great with teaching and making sure everything was going smoothly. Overall awesome will definetly go back!",positive
"This is my review as a student and I would give this place zero stars if I could. If you are considering going to cosmetology school in southern Nevada, you may be better off attending elsewhere. I enrolled into this school under the impression that I would be getting an amazing education for the 20K that I paid but instead, I am being taught by teachers who just graduated from this very same school about 2 years ago! I don't feel very confident that they know what they're doing. You have a handful of good instructors but the bad outweighs the good by a ton. They really do put customers ahead of you when you are also a customer--a 20K paying customer. They'll make you take customers that are flat out racist and very openly so no matter how they make you uncomfortable with the slurs they say. Not only that, they'll also make you take the extremely homophobic ones and these teachers will not defend you. They claim they are preparing you for the real world when in reality, in the real world you can deny service to such disgusting people. There are teachers that love to abuse their power, send you home early for no real reason and pull you off of your lunch break early just to service a customer because you, as a student, are not their priority. Worst of all, their are higher ups that will mess you up when you apply for a job within the Aveda network. If they don't like you? They'll tell the salon not to hire you. The teacher turnover rate here is astonishing. Several experienced highly talented ones have jumped ship. I almost forgot to mention, they will not teach you about two of the biggest money makers in the beauty industry right now: acrylic nails or extensions. They don't even teach you how to properly apply nail polish. If you're thinking about enrolling here? Run, run away, run away and never return!",negative
"Nice. Came in, got a cut, left happy. Of course, there were bumps along the way; but, for the price I was paying, I couldn't care less. Yes, their professionalism needs a little work. It can be awkward. I spent my entire washing with an armpit in my face, but hey, I got a cut I would usually pay $70 for, for only $14 w/ my UNLV discount. Most negative reviews seem to be related to ombres and other complicated cuts that I've had friends pay $200+ for a professional to screw up lmao... you get what you pay for?? I have a side cut, but it was handled very well. My side cut length is actually the best I've had. Impressed. Already scheduled my next appointment!",positive
"Based upon first-hand experience, I'm giving this institute 5 stars. I lived and worked in a paid, Federal internship at NAFB in Las Vegas for 6 mos in 2013, and got my brows and color done at this institute. Keeping in mind that this is a school and it will take a long time for the service, I was always really happy with my appointments. I was happy with the customer service and skill set of the students. The students asked questions of me, and that's a GOOD SIGN. They asked ME about MY formula and I was able to explain that I'd had this same formula for yearssss, so it was safe to use. They questioned why 30 vol was used on a natural blonde (me), which is not a typical formulation for blond hair, and I explained that in my case my hair could handle the 30 vol as long as it didn't overlap. This is in stark contrast to an experience I had with Aveda institute Phoenix's Aveda certified Educator, Team Lead, and Color Specialist, Angie Perino Nelson. My advice is to discuss at length with the student and Educator what you do and don't want so that you're all on the same page. Don't hesitate to write down your thoughts, bring in photos and a ruler! If you don't already have an Aveda formula to give them then have them write down the one they used for you so you can have consistency from visit to visit.",positive
"The ONLY reason I'm giving 4 stars rather than 5 is bc it did take quite some time for my partial highlights and hair cut to be complete but I was waited on right away, I received a mini facial and relaxing mini massage. The student was very good about making sure she understood exactly what I wanted and she did an awesome job!!!!!!!! I honestly couldn't have gotten better color or a better cut anywhere! I am super picky and have very straight fine hair so any mistake is very noticeable! My hair looks great and the service was beyond reasonably priced! This is def my new go to! Just make sure you don't mind spending a good portion of your day/morning there if you're also getting color!",positive
"Love this place for a huge price savings!! Misty was awesome, she listened and did her best and I honestly got better service and treatment there than Kelly Cardenas Salon who charges an arm and a leg for exactly what these students can achieve. I had a Highlight and a Blowdry with style service and it was GREAT!! Highly recommend to anyone who wants to save a HUGE amount of money. The BEST $40 I have ever spent on my hair!! I will never go to another salon again. Aveda Institute is my go to salon from now on :) :)",positive
I have been here twice for haircuts. Both times left me feeling confident and refreshed! Mandi is amazing and so is Kim (an instructor). Can't beat the price or the customer service!,positive
I had a Groupon for a cut & partial highlights. The student & instructors did a great job. I have hard to cut hair and not only did the color come out exactly how I wanted it but the cut was one of the best I've ever had in Vegas. I'll be back as a regular (non-Groupon) customer for sure!,positive
"I don't recommend this place at all. Not only was I skipped by another customer. But the manager only had to say that I had no choice to wait, since many stylists had called in. Don't punish the consumer because you don't know the basics on running a business. Or at least, acknowledge the mistake by offering a discount or free products. Is it that difficult to at least be politely or courteous to another person?",negative
"I have been going here for about 3 years. Most of the visits were good ones. Along with that, 2 bad ones, a few awesome ones and a few so-so ones. That's not a bad risk. This is a school and each student is a different person. Some are more talented than others. Great prices for the services you will get.",positive
"I bought the groupon and i didn't know they were students, I was scared for a little bit but I really liked this place. I went with my friend, she had massage and pedicure and she really liked. I had highlights and a hair cut. My student was 15 days for her graduation and she was really nice. I like the color of my hair very much but I ended up still having gray hair, I should have told her that was a big concern for me and I would like to color and hide them, but it was fine. Overall they try to help the costumers, just make sure you are very clear about what you want.",negative
"I went in to get my highlights updated and my over all color. I booked an appt on FB then drove down there and the students were doing their ""mods"". I was kinda upset telling the receptionist that they should block their days out so no on can book appts on the days the students would not be available for service. No brainier right? So she tells me to come in the next day right when they open and they will be able to do my hair. Arrived at 9 Am and got out of there at 1:30 i had a meeting to make at 2 and the student did a great job of keeping tract of time. I printed off a coupon for a free botanical treatment and when i went to pay they said since they are a school they dont accept coupons. Why not print that at the bottom? NOT ACCEPTED AT OUR SCHOOL? I wasnt too happy with that or the fact the woman at the register gave me a total without really explaining my bill to me. $80.00 My hair was still fabulous! Thats why i go back. Not really for the customer service.",negative
"Got my highlights done here. My hair dresser was very nice, and did a great job on my hair. The prices are amazing for the service they offer. She also straightened my hair at the end. She was very patient, considering I have thick curly hair. I think she just hated me a little at the end, since my hair was so hard to work on. Still, not my fault and hopefully this was a good learning experience for her.",positive
"I am new Vegas but not new to the Aveda Institute. I have been going to the one in Tempe for years and never had an issue. My stylist was in a mood and was fired or dismissed right during my color, sat for another 45 min waiting for another student to finish when my scalp started burning. New stylist informs me I have ""hot roots"" which she preceeded to fix, nightmare is an understatement. Supervisor was rude, charged me the full price of not only service 1 but the repair of the mess that stylist 1 did to my hair. I was there a total of 6.5 hours and was never offered a drink or an apology plus had to pay for orignial service plus repair service. I wrote to the owner and never heard a peep.....not worth the price folks!",negative
"I knew about this Institute, thanks to groupons, I got a haircut, very pleased and satisfied with my look, the point is you have to be patient and tell the student exactly what you want, the instructor will also come and finish the final job I paid 15$ for a very nice hair cut, I used to pay 60$ to have the same look, but now only 15$ with hand massage and facial treatment, No tip is accepted at school, thanks to Aveda, and thanks to LAs Vegas Updated on Jan 05, 2011 : Okay, I got a lots of compliments about my hairstyle, girls love it, guys love it :), so TOTALLY WORTH IT :)",positive
"I had the following services done today: -brow and lash tinting: Results were great. The service student was very nice -haircut and makeup: the student who did my hair had only 3 weeks until graduation...Thank GOD! She did a good job, consistently ask me if I like it. She was like a pro with another pro checking her work. When she did my makeup, she was very nice and made sure that my makeup was to my liking. She did exactly what I asked of her. In addition to the haircut, I got a nice little scalp and shoulder massage, a mini facial and hands massage, which were definitely good. My poor bf, however got a new student, in which it seems to be her first time cutting a real person's hair. He didn't get all the perks that I did. He also told me that she took FOREVER. The person you get to cut your hair is like the luck of the draw. I had an awesome experience, all for $45, while my bf vowed to never come back. Poor him. But, I will definitely come back.",positive
"Sure, it's cheap. But how much is your head of hair worth? I had the world's worst experience there and warn everyone not to go, especially at day's end when the students are distracted. I had a student who was almost done with her training. That scared me - she should not be allowed to cut hair. If she is so bad, imagine the new students. All she did was bitch to her friends instead of acknowledging my existence, let alone pay attention. She did tell me the instructors were all people who couldn't get salon jobs. That explains a lot, including why the instructor cut my bangs so short that I look like I just got out of an insane asylum. I would have had better luck with a monkey cutting my hair with a kitchen knife.",negative
"My friends and I decided to go to Aveda, since one of our classmates recommended it (and she always had nice hair). She mentioned that the haircuts were cheap too, only $15! When I arrived there, I was greeted by one of the junior students. She was very friendly, and would explain everything that she was doing. She also explained about each fabulous AVEDA product that she used on me. What's nice about the haircuts are that there are a lot of COMPLIMENTARY services included in that $15. First, they give you a stress relieving scalp treatment (you can choose from 3 different scents like energizing, calming, and beautiful. I chose CALM because it had a lighter scent). After that, they shampoo and condition your hair. During the conditioning process, the student would ask if I wanted a mini facial (complimentary!), and a hand/arm massage (complimentary too!). If you were wearing makeup, they would even offer a comp make-up touch-up. The students here get about 11 weeks training to do hair, and are later allowed to take clients. They each get about 2 clients a day. Most of the students are only there for about a year (Tuition is like $17K a year for them!). Make sure you get at least a junior or senior. You don't want to be getting your hair messed up! There are usually about 4 instructors on the floor, so many of the students would have to ask their instructors for some tips or advice when they encounter certain dilemmas. Don't worry! These instructors are very experienced, and make sure the students won't destroy your hair! No tipping is allowed here. However, when you buy any Aveda products, it goes to the stylist/haircutter (especially if you really wanted to tip). All of the students took their time with my friends and me (We were there for about 2 hours+!) Please be patient if you have one of the students who is VERY careful. The students were very responsive and friendly. I would definitely come back here again for my stylist to do some coloring/highlighting or even perms. They also offer Esthetics, which include relaxation packages (oil massages), stress reliever packages, exfoliating back facials, pure focus facials, and awakening wraps! Maybe a wrap in the near future?",positive
"I love the level of professionalism at this place, I was greeted promptly as I walked in and received my service really quickly. The staff is super knowledgeable and goes the extra mile ensure that you have a comfortable and relaxing experience. I got balayage done as well as a deep conditioning treatment by Paula, and she really took her time to make sure that I got the results that I wanted. She also took the time to answer all of my questions. I would definitely get my hair done here again!",positive
"I have to admit I'm a sucker for Groupons, especially for things I need such as post summer mani-pedi! 4.5/5 if I could give a 1/2 star. This place has a new owner apparently thus the Groupon and I had to book 2 weeks in advance! As they were accommodating new and existing customers which is understandable. Plus the Groupon deal was fantastic so I wasn't going to complain about waiting plus they're open late at least 2 nights a week. Ambience: nice, lots of white, quite a large place as they offer hair services, waxing, and soon o offer laser hair removal as well. The pedicure stations (two of them) are in the middle, closer to the back and separated from the from by a floor to ceiling wall. They don't have massage chairs but given that those are cess pools (of bacteria), I was relieved to see a pleather bench. The esthetician was very experienced and well groomed with lovely shellac manicure. She was very pleasant and chatty. I was getting a standard mani-pedi and they had the usual selection of Essie, OPI, etc nail polishes. Half empty bottles I might add. Deduct 1/4 of a star for that. Although perhaps I should bring my own polish. She had to put 4 coats on my toes in order for the colour to be as vibrant as it looked in the bottle. God bless her patience! I was happy with the end result. It didn't feel rushed and we had a nice chat (myself and the esthetician). And she was ready to take me as soon as I got there. She offered me tea, coffee, or water which I declined but was a lovely touch! I was happy with my pedicure and she did a good job on my heels which are in rough shape (no pun intended). I deducted another 1/4 of a star because the clear coat on my finger nails (I don't like colour on my finger nails) was peeling off the next day. I didn't notice what brand it was. I understand that we wash our hands a lot but I've never had a top coat/clear coat just peel off like that. Bonus: they give you your Emory board and bugging square, if you want it, for hygiene reasons. That's always a good sign. Given that I had the pedi first and then had to walk over to mani station in fabric open toe slippers they provided, my toes has plenty of time to dry :-) I neglected to ask they're regular rates but imagine that they are posted on their website. It's now 1-week post visit to salon and my pedicure still looks great (like I just had it done). And my mani, well, most of the clear coat is gone unfortunately. Some of my hang nails are back but that's no fault of this salon as this tends to happen to me one-week post manicure. As for colour selection....I wish there has been more colours. It felt a bit limited. Or bring your own if you're selective or want to be able to do touch ups at home. Would I come back? Yes! Would I recommend to a friend who lives in the area or drives by there? Yes! (I wouldn't go out of your way as there are comparable nail salons all across the GTA ;))",positive
Amazing haircut by Mary Grace. Everyone there was super friendly and accomodating. I reached 10 mins late for my appointment and wanted to leave early (basically i was being a difficult customer) but Mary got onto it and I was out in 50 mins :) and she dint compromise on the service.. My hair looks great and She gave me some good suggestions on how to keep it healthy.. Would recommend it to all :),positive
"A facial by Sharon was a delight! It surpassed my expectations. What I really liked, was that she was willing to teach me much more about skin care. So I left looking great, but also empowered by some simple changes that I could make to my daily routine. I am giving Sharon a 5 star review, because it was the best facial I've ever had and it was a pleasure to be in her company!",positive
"Argh, I thought I had submitted my updated review back in July! Okay, so after my horrible experience of trying to use the Buytopia voucher to no avail after it had expired - as per my first review, I had received horrible service when I tried to use the $29 towards other services like you would with a Groupon. Several months later I was contacted by the owner with an apology and an invitation to return, and with a promise that they would honor my voucher. I was still pretty pissed off over the whole drama, so I hesitated for over a month - and finally I decided to give them a call. I was impressed by how willing and adamant they were to try to fix the situation and ""make it up to me."" I really did not want anything beyond what I had purchased, and would have been more than happy to just use the $29 towards a service and not get the actual deal I had purchased. I knew I had let the deal expire and wanted to own up to that. But they were persistent about giving me the deal. So I went in and got a mani-pedi (shellac for my nails and regular polish for my toes). The service was friendly, efficient, and I was very happy with the results. The only reason I am not giving the experience 5 stars is because the shellac did not last as long as I am used to, but then again, I may have been washing and using my hands more than usual. Who knows. But also, when I got to the salon and told them what I was there to get, they did not believe me when I told them that I was there for a mani-pedi and it could be shellac for both (the deal I has purchased was for a shellac mani-pedi - though I was happy to settle for regular polish for my feet). Apparently the deal I had was an old one (they could not remember it), and the one they most recently offered was for a regular mani-pedi with a massage. But once I showed them a copy of the deal, all was well. Overall, I am impressed by a business that is willing and adamant to make a customer happy. Too often businesses don't want to bother with one person that had a bad experience or that was unhappy for not getting their way. But this certainly was not the case here. Thank you for turning a frustrating experience to a positive one!",positive
"Would Definitely recommend this place. I got a mani pedi, massage and facial. Great service and wonderful staff. Inside was very clean and days later my face is still silky soft.",positive
"I found the prices reasonable compared to salons in the area, but the quality is superior . . I always go to Paul Mitchell salons and I'm happy to have one in my area without having to pay downtown prices. I've never left there without an amazing experience.",positive
"Never going back!!!! Mind you, my hair turned out amazing, they charged me $300!!!!!!!!!! For not a full set of highlights, but a half set. Along with a cut and style. Never in this city have I paid more than $200 for that same request, and with the same product they used!!! Furious with myself for accepting to pay for this, but even more furious that they think it's okay to spend 3+ hours on your hair and charge you that outrageous amount. (bye bye groceries for the next month or two)",negative
Moving here from Texas and leaving my hairdresser of 18 years was hard. I totally lucked out finding Michelle. She is a master at hair coloring and styling as well. Her shop is private and decorated so well. Also she's like talking to your best girlfriend! Can't recommend Blondies enough!!!,positive
"I've been nervous to leave Michelle a review for fear more people will find this hidden gem! Well, not so hidden anymore. She's right in the heart of old town, and is an absolute color expert. I've gotten to the point where I don't even have a plan before I get there, but instead just tell her what I'm feeling or what I'm ""going for"". I've been super dark brunette, ombre, beachy blonde...you name it. And each time I've loved it more than the last. She'll play fun movies to watch and lounge while you're getting pampered and is always super entertaining. She's become a great friend (probably just by being a great listener), and couldn't say enough great things about her work! PS, have her style your hair before a big event. It's the bomb.com.",positive
Michelle is the greatest! She does an excellent job with my blonde highlights. I love getting my hair done by her she is very personable and makes the experience comfortable and fun.,positive
Been going to MICHELLE for about 7 years. Nothing but spectacular can describe her artistry .. Hair color and brows she is a true master.,positive
I cannot tell you how AMAZING my hair looks now. I was a dark brunette with lots of color in my hair and she was able to pull out all my color in one session and make me a wonderful platinum blonde. I highly recommend this salon! 5 stars all the way! I've never loved my hair more.,positive
"This is a really neat salon center with many tiny one-room salons. Michelle got her hands on my fiancée's hair for our wedding and she did a great job in making her blonder (and I mean that as far as color goes, not intelligence). Meanwhile I was languishing for 2 1/2 hours, so thank you Mark Zuckerberg for your social networking site.",positive
"Michelle at The Color Room is a miracle worker, and an amazing stylist. She transformed my brown hair into a beautiful blonde, and was such a professional about everything. We had a 20 minute consultation about what to do, how we were going to do it (and by we I mean her). She completely understood what I was looking for, and was a great listener. Overall the whole color, cut, thinning out process (I have extremely thick hair) took a little under 4 hours, and Michelle never once seemed tired or annoyed that I was there for so long. I even offered for her to just blow dry my hair but not style it if things would take too long, but she refused to let me leave without looking anything but fabulous, even if was almost 10pm at night. I am in LOVE with my color, the cut looks great, the layers make my hair fall really well, and I had a great time chatting with Michelle the whole time. By far the best hair experience I have ever encountered in regards to color, pricing, and everything in between. I will be a regular from now on.",positive
"Wanting to go with something different and more professional for the holidays than the local Great Clips I was recommended by a few friends to go to Michelle at the Color Room. I was definitely impressed. Great little location in Old Town amongst a whole bunch of other beauty and hair related businesses in the Total Image Beauty Mall. Michelle was very friendly, professional, and a good listener which I find important in a stylist. I thought she did a great job with my hair and I will definitely be returning. My (girl)friends get their hair colored and cut here and it always comes out great. Prices were reasonable and I came out with a great look.",positive
Hair cut was great. Salon is really professional looking and pleasant. Michelle listened to what I wanted and accomplished the result I was going for. Good job,positive
I can see where other reviewers thought staff was a bit on the stuffy side. I got a great haircut! I found the place a little lacking in warmth or friendliness. Felt a little like an outsider as opposed to a valued client whom they wanted to know better.,negative
"I went to have a haircut and color with Sarah on Tuesday and I couldn't be happier! Not only was the salon accommodating with an appointment at 6 pm, but the level of professionalism and expertise by the stylist was very clear. The salon was very clean and welcoming and I will continue to make the hour long drive from Mesa just to know I am going to get a great haircut and color.",positive
Shanelle is great! I had a haircut I wasn't happy with and she fixed it for me while I wait until it grows out. Plus she did fabulous color on me! I would definitely recommend her to anyone! Ask for Shanelle!!,positive
I have had Shanelle Hill as my stylist for 2 years. I had tried several salons since moving here 5 yrs ago. Finally I found a great stylist who actually listens to what I want concerning my hair cut .style etc. Shanelle cares about what the client wants.I have had many compliments and questions about who my stylist is..I was so fortunate to have found Shanelle and have recommended her to many acquaintance s.,positive
"I've known a lot of these girls for years and they are most definitely the most talented hairstylists I have worked with and had my hair done by. Beth is my hairstylist and my sisters and she is amazing. Tara, Alia, Patti, and Shanelle are all great hairstylists and have all at one point done my hair. I did hair for over 10 years and I know what to look for, and I trust all of them. Aveda is gentle, and a great product line.",positive
"I not sure what to say. I should have read the yelp reviews first. So disappointed right now. I've been growing my hair for almost a half a year. I requested someone with experience. The girl said oh this girl has over 12 years exp so today I go to get my hair cut with my daughter and I got the worst hair cut ever. I ask Kristen how old she is. ""21"" she said. Okay so she has been doing hair since she was what 9? I was so mad I couldn't even say anything. We should have had my 15 yr old cut our hair and saved $80.00. We both felt like we just went to a chop shop. These girls need to learn how to cut hair and how to treat customers.",negative
"I have been going here for the past few months and seeing Amber for brow waxing. She is a lovely woman and typically does a fabulous job on my brows, and that's saying something because I'm extremely picky. This last time I saw her, it seemed like she might have forgotten what I typically like my brows to be because she ""notched"" one of them which I can't stand. The other problem I have had, is that the receptionist is ultra snobby and rude. She looks down on everyone that seems to comes through the door. She is very unpleasant to deal with on any level...like by making an appointment I seem to be wasting HER time? Get real. She made me an appointment for 11am. I got there at 10:50 am. she gave me an attitude because I was early. Really? Not sure if I will continue to go. Most likely, I will be taking my business elsewhere",negative
"I will never return again. You lost a customer. This would have been my 4th visit to the salon. After trying all weekend to make an appointment for my mother and self I finally got a call Tuesday morning 12/10 the day I wanted my appointment. Made the appointment for 1 and the receptionist said she would have her other girl shanell come in early so we could both have a stylist. Upon arrival shanell sat me down and asked me what I wanted done. When I started to explain the color I wanted she said ""whoa whoa I thought you just wanted a cut. Hold on"" she went to the front (where my mother was waiting to be called back) and checked what the receptionist wrote, then my mother heard the receptionist say that I had told her I only wanted a cut. LIAR. Then shanell went to the back and started complaining to whoever was in the back and after a few minutes finally came back to me. She said ""I can color your hair, maybe cut it, but I don't have time for anything else so you can just sit under the dryer. I came in early to help you out and I just don't have time"" we decided against it and left. Clearly your employees mistakes are my fault and I should feel bad for her having to come in early? No thanks I'll take our business elsewhere.",negative
"I bought a groupon online I liked my haircut but the whole experience was just okay. My stylist who never introduced herself to me, she wasn't personal or friendly and said barely 10 words the whole 45 min I was there. I won't be back.",negative
"I bought a Groupon for this place because my regular hairstylist's dad was real sick. I was ten minutes late for my appointment which I called to give them a heads up about. When I got there the receptionist said the stylist had just run to Starbucks. When she walked in, she said, ""Is this it?"" (Meaning her appointment) and the receptionist said yes. First of all, THIS??? Is this it? Um, I'm a human being thanks. Then, she never introduced herself, I still don't know her name, and she wasn't very chatty at all like I'm used to hairstylists usually being. She made it sound like my ten minutes was a HUGE inconvenience for her. I finally had to break the ice and start talking to her which she did talk to me, but still didn't really engage. The salon itself is really nice. Their hair washing stations are super comfortable and don't hurt your neck at all. Oh but did I mention she washed my hair with cold water? Brr!! I won't go back.",negative
"I really hate to tell everyone how awesome Tara is at Botanicals. When I first started seeing her, I could get appointments in a day or two. Sometimes even the same day. Now she's become so popular that it takes a week or more to get to see her. Totally worth it. I trust her with my hair. I can tell her my vision and she sees it. I've never gotten a bad cut from her. In fact, now I just tell her to do her thing and she knows what to do. I've started taking my daughter with me as well. It's $15 for a kid's cut and that includes the awesome shampoo/massage with the lavender shampoo. My princess is spoiled. My daughter has an asymmetrical bob with choppy sides. Very fashion forward. Others have totally failed to do it right, but Tara rocks it out every time. I don't know about the other people at Botanicals, but Tara is, hands down, amazing!",positive
"I have never had a worst experience getting my hair done. I actually cried! I have short blonde hair that I asked for the roots to be touched up and toned to be a nice beige-y blonde. Not something anyone has ever been confused about before. I come out looking like a lemon-frosted cupcake! Absolutely awful! I asked for it to be toned down...my stylist and another looked at me so confused and had NO clue what to do. Then they said they'd fix it. OMG...it was worse! It was orange AND muddy looking!? I was again very disappointed and feeling defeated at this point...they were blaming MY hair. Then the owner comes over with an attitude acting like I didn't tell them what I wanted. So I had to pull out old pictures of myself just to show what my hair SHOULD look like. After over 5 (yes 5!) hours of this I left with dark hair and steaks of blonde (which i expressed several times that i didnt want streajs)...i left with a wet head. PLUS they charged me for everything!!! I didn't even know how bad it was till I got home. It looks grey-ish and muddy! I went from a vibrant blonde to muddy, old looking hair. The cut was horrible, too. This is an Aveda concept salon. I would expect higher quality! I called today to speak with the manager or owner and the receptionist was rude (like every time I've called) and basically told me someone will call when they get around to it. I have no idea how much this will vist me to fix. I'm devastated.",negative
"Worst Owner/Manager, terrible receptionist. Don't ever buy a gift certificate, difficult to use, improper handling of appointments, rude receptionist and owner.",negative
"Absolutely the worse highlights & haircut EVER. The front of my hair was totally blonde, the ""highlights"" went down to my ear on the left side, stopped at the crown on the left side & stopped midcrown in the back. When the stylist (Kristin) said she would cut 2"" off I thought she meant she would only cut off 2"" - my hair is now 2"" long - she did not clean the back of the neck & left the nape long. After going home & crying I paid another stylist to totally recolor my hair & trim the back evenly. The cost is outrageous at Botanicals - I would NEVER, NEVER, NEVER GO BACK THERE. PS: the receptionist is snotty",negative
I've been coming here for 3 years and I love it!!! Beth is absolutely amazing and no matter what she does I walk out smiling. Katie and Alia are also good. The staff has always been super sweet to me and I've never had any problems. Thanks for everything Beth!!!,positive
"I am new to the area, and was looking for a new stylist for my daughter and I. I chose this place because of the location and that it wasn't a run down old place like some of them in Surprise. My stylist\colorist was very nice and talkative, but in the end she was rushing through cutting and stylingbecause her next client was waiting. Very disappointed! I am a paying customer! My daughter had the most unlikable stylist! She said 5 words to her the whole time, blow dried it with no style! Wow and the receptionist checking us out, was even more unlikable, no smile no thank you! We will never go back and I will give this business bad press as much as possible!",negative
"This is the third time I've been here and certainly the last. I had a spa pedicure and the nail tech didn't say 5 words to me the entire time I was in the chair. It was extremely uncomfortable as I felt like I was imposing on her time by being a paying customer. My nails didn't turn out any better than if I'd done them myself. I do get regular pedicures at a more expensive salon/spa but thought I would try Botanicals again since they are closer and less expensive. I guess you get what you pay for. When I was finished and she led me to the counter she said ""nice meeting you"" while looking distantly out the window. It couldn't have been more impersonal. Then I was checked out by some teen eating her drive-thru breakfast. Appalling. Will not return ever. Also, before I wrote this review I left a message for the manager to call me so I may discuss this. I never received a call.",negative
"I got a groupon here, and I got services with Amy and I liked the job she did so much that I became a regular customer. I really think they are reasonably priced, and I also love Aveda anyway so I always come here now! Great to find a nice salon when you are new in town.",positive
"My father had purchased groupons for my mom and me to use here. When I called them in, it turns out that by select stylists they meant two. Just two. I was hesitate about this one especially since they wanted new clients only. It seemed like a desperate attempt to try to drum up business. Not that all salons on groupons are like that. In DC I've seen some very good salons just trying to attract more clients while catering to their base. The receptionist on the phone was not friendly about it and they refused to be accommodating. The price of color isn't that high but due to their customer service, I wouldn't care if they happened to be the best stylists in the Phoenix area, I still wouldn't go to them. I have an appointment set up with someone who costs more but both she and the salon were friendly and very accommodating. Based on customer service I would not recommend this salon. Two stylists for something that would bring in as many customers such as Groupon is unintelligent as a business move. This obviously leaves disgruntled clients. For anyone else with a groupon, we were able to get our money back because Groupon agreed that this behavior was wrong.",negative
"If you need someone to save your eyebrows, visit Karla here, she is excellent. She also spends the time to teach you how to pencil them in and make them look amazing.",positive
"Once again Butter worked their magic! After getting my hair literally hacked off at Distilled Beauty Bar, I didn't think Butter could do anything with it for my annual Christmas party. Trust me...I warned them when I made the appointment. They allowed for extra time and assigned me to Sara She was a bit shocked at the cut I received a couple months ago. We discussed and looked at a few pics on the iPad. After looking at my outfit and getting a feel for what will work, she went to work. She nailed it with a messy, sexy, updo with a couple of fishtail braids and a low, off to the side knot!!! It looked fab with the shape of my face, it hid the hack job perfectly. Most importantly, I felt amazing! Let's not forget to give a shout out to Karla! She's been doing my makeup for my Christmas party or any occasion for the last four years! She makes me looks gorgeous! If I want to do something different, she does her all to deliver. If its too cray, cray, she'll tell you no...but a polite no. I'm self-conscious about my eyelids...again she enhances and beautifies what I think are my flaws. Butter Beauty is a definite go to for any occasion! Not only for the price, but for amazing artists who definitely listen and take care of you!",positive
"Karla is amazing! If you're looking for perfect brows, she is your girl. Not only is she so talented at brow shaping, she is also an all around wonderful person and I look forward to my appointments with her.",positive
"I'm extremely impressed with Butter! Sitting here drying after my pedicure as I speak. My esthetician Anna was phenomenal. You can tell she loves what she is doing and is very experienced, I've never been happier with a pedicure. Kelsey did my blowout, great conversation and my usually flat, limp hair looks voluminous and fresh. Will be returning!",positive
"I absolutely love Butter. Just had the most amazing pain free Brazilian from Robyn, she is awesome I would highly recommend anybody to her especially those who dread getting waxed as I do, Robyn is my go to girl. Pain free, quick and really clean. I will defiantly be back for my wax again.",positive
"I am very disappointed with Butter.I went there for trial run prior to my son's wedding, well it turned out to be 5 tries and 3 stylists later and still my hair was a mess. I showed them pictures and everything was yes we can do that, but no they could not.I have very long and curly hair, when they put product in it ( a lot of product ) my hair did not last.I was told by the first stylist that the back looked great, yes it did for the hour, but I told her pictures are taken from the front. The price was reasonable for the first 3 tries ( $38.95) and yes I had to pay for all even though they could not style my hair. The day before the wedding they charged a fortune ($ 110.00 ) and the day off the wedding the price was crazy ($ 210.00). The day of the wedding the whole wedding party was there (that is the only reason I went )and at the end my hair was taking soooo long to do that my bride to be had to finish it.. What a shame that these people do not take more styling classes to deal with all kind of hair types. My stylist told me the bangs were to long and she did not have scissors to cut them, I did not want them cut just styled. No one there was able to offer any help, they certainly do not work as a team and help each other out. My make up girl was very good!",negative
"My new go to nail salon. All of the staff are always welcoming and friendly. Love being offered a tea, coffee or pop each time I arrive, and love the modern decor. Robyn dies an amazing job every time!",positive
"The decor is impressive. Great service. I am very happy with my pedi and medi. Mila did a lovely job, and she gives an awesome foot massage, too.",positive
"Just had my first wax at Butter salon. I really liked the look of the place so was excited to go. The first receptionist I met was great really warm welcome, and the girl who did my service, Zoe was friendly. I explained to her what I wanted, which is a specific and small area, basicly under crotch and behind! she did it okay, Ive had better. It was more painful than most other times ive had it done and felt longer. although I like shabby chic the treatment room was dirty. like it hadnt been cleaned overnight. There were random eyelash extensions everywhere on the towels and sheets which I could forgive in a lower priced place at the end of a busy day. the sheet she on the bed had loads of stains on it, one looked like a coffee ring?. Its just wasn't clean enough. Afterwards my friend decided to get an eyebrow wax, the same girl did it . Again she was great to talk to but she didn't do a very thorough job, afterwards we noticed alot of random hairs which should have been tweezed. It looked a bit half finished. He recieved $10 off for my referring him, and thats good because he paid $11, which befits the level of service he recieved. Full price is $21. I was charged a for a bikini wax which I never actually had, my esthetician told the receptionist that I did not have a proper wax, just a small area and the second receptionist said thats the price for a bikini wax. I thought she would have offered me the $16 miscellanous wax (which is printed on the price list) but she didn't. She had a bit of an attitude when I asked her about it too. Overall I'd say I was dissapointed with my negative experience. I think this place looks great, but its a little style over substance. I could have been over charged someplace else, with slightly less dressy surroundings and still have left happier.",negative
"I had a great first experience at Butter Beauty Parlour. A very fun afternoon of pampering! I had a gel gloss pedicure and my hair styled. The pedicure has lasted for almost a month and I'm very happy with it. I'm pretty particular about how my hair is styled - the stylist did a good job, but I felt put too many products in my hair. It's very thick, so if it's weighed down with product, the style will fall out...which it did and I had to fix at home. I enjoyed the pedicure so much that I've already booked a spa afternoon with co-workers. With the 5 pedicure stations and 4 manicure stations, it's a great place to book a girls' day for a birthday party, stagette, or just because!",positive
"Wow. I love Butter! Tessa is my go-to-girl for all my hair wants, needs, and dreams. Not only is she a hair magician in creating exactly what I want, but also an amazing teacher with helping me recreate my look. I get more product knowledge from that girl than I know what to do with! Im already looking forward to my next visit, see you soon girls!",positive
"This place is great. Efficient and well-priced, I will be going back! It feels clean and trendy, and I was quite happy with my services. They sell lovely products - Bumble and Bumble hair care (no shock as Hedkandi owns Butter), and a few other lines including lovely candles that I was quite tempted by (next time!). Like Hedkandi, Butter offers online booking, which I love. The place is a little bit hard to find - it shares the building with WURST, and they don't yet have their signage up!",positive
"I am beyond amazed with how my hair turned out! I definitely needed to do something. My hair before was dull and lifeless, and was in desperate need of a trim. Joey brought it back to life! I got some highlights and a trim. My hair is completely transformed! I love my new hair so much. Just in time for new years too! If you are looking for a new look or even looking to get your hair done for a New Year's Eve party, ask for Joseph Volpe! Thank you so much Joey!",positive
I just went in off a Groupon and Arend was outstanding.. I had all over color done and a haircut.. He advised me accordingly and my hair turned out the way I wanted.. I highly recommend this salon.,positive
"Had my hair done by joseph v. Amazing ! I did a red ombre with cut and hit it on the spot. he styled it for a couple minutes in the end it turned out sooo beautifully. I had so many compliments already ! Best part, during the whole process, he took his time which I appreciate even though he had another client waiting. (Which the other client didnt even mind waiting because thats how good he is) thanks !",positive
Love the atmosphere here. Friendly staff and very clean! I've had my hair done by Nasana and Tina they are both great. I also love the Njoy(spellcheck?) products Nasana uses in my hair. My hair always comes out so healthy looking and soft.,positive
"Yelp has never let me down, until now. Haircut by Larry. Very personable..unfortunately, WORST haircut in my life. I always ask new stylists if they know how to cut bangs as I have pretty heavy bangs similar to Zooey Deschanel and it seems to be rocket science to cut them correctly. He said it would not be a problem. I even showed a photo. I told him the last guy that trimmed my bangs did a terrible job and foreshadowing: whenever I said I didnt like something he did, he blamed it on the last guy. Anyway, here you go: At first he took off a tiny amount to the point where my bangs were the same length as when I walked in. Told him to cut it shorter which he did but the triangular shape was not there. I described to him how my hairstylist (who unfortunately moved out of town) would frame them and then cut. He did not understand. I needed them to flow into the rest of my hair, almost like a wide upside down U. So my already thin hair was then cut like a ""sex kitten"" as he put it where he glided the scissors down my hair to create a weird layer which will just end up looking like a bunch of flyaway strands. I told him I didn't like it and I am assuming that was end beginning of the end, he CUT the hair off. I didn't realize he bluntly chopped off hair that was not part of my bangs (see picture). SO pissed. Had I noticed this, I would not have tipped. Learned my lesson. Enough with the bangs. I told him I wanted about 1-2 inches off cut totally straight as my hair reached mid back. My request turned into him cutting it like a U. Long story short, I have to wait for these extremely short pieces of hair to grow out the length of my long hair. Good luck if you take your chances with this place.",negative
"Specifically Joseph Volpe, seriously amazing stylist, articulate, experienced and up to date on styles, cuts and of course color. Over 20 years experience and has clients from day one of his career. The salon is simple, open and always plenty of parking . His prices are very affordable and he takes c/c or cash. Mostly works Tuesday thru Saturday but will makes appointments on Sunday and Monday if needed.",positive
"I recommend this studio! The staff is friendly and our stylist, Sarah, does a great job without taking a long time. I am fussy about my bangs. None of the other stylists I have been to will cut them the right way to flatter my face and keep my bangs out of my eyes. Sarah listened to me carefully the first time I went there, and she makes them look perfect each time. My boyfriend gets his hair cut at Capelli as well, and he always looks wonderful after the cut. The stylist trims his hair to make his face look handsome and manly. The prices are reasonable -- it costs more than Great Clips (ugh!), but it's worth it",positive
"Went in to get my hair cut yesterday as my first time there. Service was excellent. I was very happy to see how clean everything was, as well as how friendly the staff was. This is the only salon I go to from now on! Hair stylist: Michell.",positive
"The more I thought about my review I wanted to update. First, the business is gone now. Second, I stopped in a few weeks ago to get a manicure and ended up walking out without an appointment because the owner couldn't manage to pull herself away from her phone long enough to even greet a customer. Further, she was screaming at a customer for missing an appointment. She sounded abusive. I mean, who the heck gets that irate at a person and calls them a curse word? Get some help with your issues, lady. I'm happily getting my hair done across the street at a salon that is clean, has nice employees, and not run by a woman who could be a case study in psychopathy.",negative
"Short version - Stay away even if you have a gift card!!!! How this place stays in business is a wonder. The products they use look like they came from someone's junk drawer. This place tries to look fancy but it's all cheap low quality stuff. There is clearly a lack for training for these nice girls. The quality is very very poor especially for the prices. My polish looks like a 5 year old did it . I would have no problem paying these prices if the quality actually reflected the prices. The music was extremely loud, I don't know how someone would find a massage relaxing. We didn't have the joy of seeing the manager in person, however we did over hear several of her phone calls to the staff. All she seems to care about is making a quick buck. I don't think anyone is actually licensed. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone and I would never come back even if it was a free service.",negative
This place was absolutely horrible and the owner could not justify the additional charges that she was charging us. I would call the IRS and let them know of her unjustified charges so they can put a stop to this. This is by far the worst place I have ever seen and the owner treated us horribly.,negative
What an awful experience. The owner was rude and the service was terrible and overpriced. It was not relaxing at all. A complete waste of money.,negative
"I really wanted to like this place. I spent a lot of money on a massage, facial, mani, and pedi. Probably more money then I should have to begin with. The massage was excellent. The facial was subpar. She didn't ask me what concerns I had with my skin. She didn't ask what I was after. She didn't even ask if I had oily or dry skin. While a mask was setting she gave a leg/foot massage which was so hard I have bruises four days later. She never asked if the pressure was ok. The manicure was horrid. They didn't trim my cuticles or offer any massage that comes standard with any other manicure I've ever had. It was literally polish and that's it. And to top it all off it chipped after 3 days. Gel manicure that's supposed to last at least 7 days, chipped. The girl was also nice enough to apply shellac on my skin around my nails so it looks pretty rough. The pedicure was great excerpt the polish. They didn't put any dividers in my toes so it was smudged from the start. The owner is super sweet and spent a lot of time talking to me but in the end I paid way to much money for totally subpar services.",negative
The workers were great and the salon was nice. We went for the 189 facial and massage deal from groupon. We decided to purchase it directly from the salon. I should have asked about gratuity and sales tax prior. The owner rung us up and charged us gratuity and sales tax from the original price not the discounted price. We walked out paying 295. I hope that the girls that did the service actually receive the tip. I wanted to hand the cash over and felt akward asking to do so. The owners daughter was at the checkout counter and even though she was young it is not an excuse for her to not have better manners while talking to clients. We will not be back. To many hidden fees akward situations.,negative
"I received a gift certificate to Carlitta's a month ago, the message was fantastic. My shellac manicure wasn't the best, lasted less than a week. However, the workers were very nice and wanted to ensure I had a great experience. The real problem is when it came time to pay, the owner wouldn't accept my gift certificate. She insisted I didn't mention I got the certificate when I called to make the appointment, but I very well did. I don't understand what is the difference from a gift certificate to actual money? The owner seems like a person who is always trying to make an extra penny and probably wanted me to have to schedule another appointment so she can make twice the amount. One of the worst customer service experiences from a greedy person.",negative
I would not recommend this spa. Every word out of the owner's mouth is a sales pitch. Made me very uncomfortable. Tried charging me for bogus services. Our manicures were so had I went somewhere else after to get them fixed. Never again!,negative
Had a great experience! Had a brow waxing and haircut. Got an appointment the same day. Mary was very nice and I got a great look!,positive
"I was chose this salon to host an ""appreciation event"" for some of our business partners (financial industry). We invited our guests for ""Mani's & Pedi's"". There were 7 of us total and the event was setup from 3pm -5pm. Overall, our experience was just ok, but I would never come back here. A few things I wanted to address: Price: This place is extremely over priced for the quality of service you receive. I received a polish change and a pedicure from Jenn. She was sweet and while I did enjoy talking to her, the french tip that was done on my nails was NOT worth $20 (plus tip) My pedicure was fine but at $48 I would expected to be WOW'D! I assume they can charge so much due to location but the quality of the product and the overall experience should be up to par. Salon: When I first walked in the Salon I wasn't sure if I was in a retail store or a Salon. They have a mini-shop setup in front which is cluttered and quite honestly, disorganized. They are selling items from tea, to clothing, to purses to hair products. Is this a SPA or a retail shop? Honestly, I think the owner is really missing the mark here. if you are going to call yourself a DAY SPA and charge DAY SPA prices, you should probably focus on the SPA atmosphere and not what random item you are going to try and sell me. It was painfully obvious within a few minutes of arriving that the owner Carla was really clueless. Not only was she dressed inappropriately (black mini skirt & open-toed stilettos) not once did she follow up with us to make sure everything was running smoothly and to our expectations. I get it, she's busy but if you are going to be present in your salon it's really a good idea to make sure your guests are happy, especially, when a company chooses to hold their event and spend hundreds of dollars at your salon. When 5 o'clock rolled around and our event was over, we asked for our bill. We had to ask a total of 4 times for our bill, which is when everything just fell apart. Not only did they attempt to charge us for services that were not performed (Spa Pedicure when it was really a polish change) the girls who were cashing us out, were clueless. Bless their hearts they were just trying to help, and where was a manager or the owner? Carla was giving someone a pedicure, and did not once offer to help the poor girl who was trying to cash us out that did not know how to operate the systems. When we finally received our bill; which was hand-written on a notepad, we were never offered to include gratuity when they ran our credit cards. So of course, they had to run the card twice. Finally, when we called the salon to follow up on our dissatisfaction, not one apology. Ultimately, we will never be back here, and I do not recommend this salon for anyone looking for good quality services.",negative
"I had previously spotted this place while stopping by Melt and Panera in Independence. I happened to notice it was open late and stopped in for a quick manicure to try it out. I was a little surprised to find out that they offered 15 minute massages, but didn't have massage chairs. My manicure was good and held up for well over a week (which is really good for me!). I do plan on going back when I have time to try out a pedicure. They also have a boutique selling some clothing items and gifts that are worth checking out.",negative
"Such a beautiful salon! Right from the moment you walk in! It's very lux and upscale, and everyone is so nice. Came in as. Walk in for my pedi, basic pedi is $30, a little more than your typical nail salon, but def worth it! As the look and feel makes you feel very fancy! They make sure to provide you with a beverage of your choice ranging from water, coffee and eve champagne! Hence the name! This is an awesome place to come if your really want to feel pampered. Can't wait to come back with my ladies, to relaxed with a pedi and some champagne! The lady that did my pedi was really sweet too",positive
Brittany is an amazing stylist who is professional and stays current in the industry. She truly knows what she's doing with color and cuts and her blowouts are beyond belief! It's the first time I've ever had a blowout last for 3 days! The salon is pretty and the people at the front desk are helpful and very nice.,positive
I got a haircut by Brittany! She was very kind and knowledgeable. Felt so comfortable. Honestly the best layers I've had yet! She knows what she's doing!,positive
Just recently moving here I had no idea where to go so I took a chance and I LOVED the outcomes!! Super cute place too. For never having my hair done professionally I was a little scared but they take great care of you and have great service.,positive
Gorgeous salon with all the bells & whistles! Brittany took such good care of me & gave me the exact look I was asking for! Coached me on how to better take care of my hair. They have great deals other salons don't offer like a membership for blow outs!!!! I look forward to coming back!,positive
"It's been three weeks since I last visited this place. I must say I would prefer this place over the other location. The staff here are very welcoming. I was not impressed with the last location. They were not sure on prices and gave me such expensive deals. The lady I spoke with was saying their location is different and much better nail-techs but not according to Yelp. Anyways, the atmosphere of this location was fascinating. It allowed me to feel I was at a 5 star nail salon located on the strip. The lady who did my nails was Kayla. She was very funny and sweet to talk to (i enjoy conversations during my manicures; it's less awkward lol). I was impressed and amazed by the way she did my chrome nails. They lasted me for about 2 1/2 weeks. Definitely going to recommend this location to my friends.",positive
My hair was really damaged from a hairstylist not from Champagne's and i desperately needed to get re-done. I went to Carla who re bleached my hair and colored it. I don't know how but its healthier than ever before. She took her time and was really patient even though I had no idea what i wanted to get done. Overall I love my hair and Carla is the best!,positive
"AWESOME place!! I wanted a new hair style, something fun but not too wild. CARLA was my stylist and she made my vision come true! I showed her a simple picture I found on Pinterest of black and blue hair. She informed me of SO much and the different ways she could accomplish getting my hair to turn out that way. She let me know the safest ways to color change and what would be best for what I was going for since I didn't want to go to full black hair from my brownish/ blonde hair I currently had. Once we figured out what we were doing, she poured me some champagne and I just sat back in the chair and waited for her to do her magic! A few hours later, she did an awesome blow out, took some photos and then FINALLY let me see the final product! I LOVE IT!! My hair is freakin awesome! It's not loud, looks natural in normal light, but the blue POPS in the sunlight just right! She did a fabulous job! Seriously, anything you're looking at getting done, even if you're not sure exactly how you want it, she can guide you in the right direction and I guarantee you'll love the end product!! CARLA WAS FANTASTIC!!!",positive
"I went to a budget hair salon and had the worst haircut ever. When I got home and realized the damage I immediately called up Champagne salon to see if I could be seen for an emergency visit. They got me in right away and we're sympathetic to my awful experience. The salon is beautiful and the staff is incredibly accommodating. I walked in distressed and they offered me a complimentary glass of champagne immediately. What a wonderful touch! Free refills too ;). I was taken care of by Irene and she did a fantastic job. This is a full service salon and I'm already looking forward to my next visit, possibly for a mani pedi. Thank you so much for saving me and squeezing me in. I will be a customer for life!",positive
"Totally love this place. Erika & Tabitha are amazing! A bit pricey but, you get what you pay for right? they completely fixed all my dry dead hair and put my extensions in. i go in monthly for a tightening on them and they all know me and its so friendly :) 10/10 would reccommend.",positive
"I have been extremely disappointed with this spot several times now. The first time I got a pedi here one of the girls cut my skin by my nail and it got infected and turned into a three week ordeal. In good faith i decided to try it again because it's a cute place and conveniently located. I had a couple of decent experiences until this last time... The girl rubbed my skin so raw That I haven't been able to wear close toed shoes for days now. I have never experienced any pedicures as terrible as these girls have given me at any other place. For the cost of this spot, you'd think they'd have some girls that knew what they were doing. To top it all off, the girl finished doing my nails and just got up and left. Never massaged me or said anything indicating that she was done... She painted the last layer of paint and just got up out of nowhere and left to go gossip with coworkers. So disappointed",negative
"This place is fantastic! Everyone who works there is so friendly and welcoming. The pedicure chairs are very comfortable. I love the layout. It's nice and open and doesn't feel cramped. I had multiple services done and loved everything! Plus, they actually have champagne!",positive
"I came here for my first time today. I absolutely LOVE this place. I got a cut and shampoo & blow dry. The girl who did it I think her name was Kazar? ( something like that) She was nice and genuine which is like never heard of in Vegas, lol. She took her time, explained everything to me on what she was doing & my hair looks and feels great !!! The girls at the front desk are also very nice and friendly. I would definitely recommend Champagne Salon & Spa #2 to everyone. This place is downright awesome! Going back next week!",positive
"I follow Miss Tabitha wherever she goes and I'm so excited that she's now managing this new location right by my house. They really are a full service spa or a one stop shop, as I like to call it. From the moment I came in, I was warmly greeted by the beautiful receptionists and I love that the salon stays true to the name and offers champagne and also coffee n water. They practically cater to my every need - quick trim with Ms. Peggy (absolutely amazing and super funny), fill with the beautiful Miss Tabitha (always does me so well), pedicure with the lovely Miss Kim (very accommodating and fast) and they even fit in a girlfriend of mine last minute and have her being treated like a queen while she gets a Mani/pedi at the same time so we can both make it to work. Tabitha keeps a tight ship and I greatly appreciate her attention-to-detail when it comes to her nail shaping and artwork. More importantly, she pays close attention to the staff to ensure every client has the best experience.",positive
Absolutely this is as good as it gets with nail salons. I accidentally booked my mani/pedi at the wrong Champagne location but kept the appointment any how. I've only had one mani/pedi at the other location so don't have a certain girl yet. This location like the other one is AMAZING!! Everyone there was just as friendly and nice as the other location. Great job guys!!! Thanks so much for an amazing experience!!!!!,positive
I was looking for a Salon close to home. After reading some reviews I scheduled my appointment with Brittany. She did an awesome job cutting and styling my hair. I have short hair and like an unconventional cut. I made my next appointment for six weeks. The front desk ladies were also very friendly. Thank you!,positive
I love my manicure and pedicure! The staff was so nice! Very clean and a very good atmosphere! Definitely enjoyed my champagne! Also had my eyebrows done and they are perfect!!! Def will be back!,positive
"Hey Zee, thanks again for my beautiful nails and great conversation. You are amazing. The whole staff was a pleasure to be around. This salon has amazing people working for them. The whole staff was pleasant.",positive
"Yup, hands down Champagne Salon is the best! Fantastic customer service, upbeat atmosphere and a friendly, united team. The Ice Cream Pedi is a must due to the yummy scents to choose from and the products soak deep into the skin. My skin is still soft from yesterday! Oh, and did I mention they have Bubbles!",positive
Sitting here getting a pedicure drinking a glass of champagne and completely relaxing! Eileen is fabulous. She gave me the best foot/ lower leg massage I have ever gotten during a pedicure. Friendly staff! Not very busy on a Thursday afternoon if you are free. Will definitely be back! Wish they had more polish to choose from but it's okay! And they have packages which is unique to this Salon. I would love to do them if I had the extra money. Worth it if you get multiple services done a month.,positive
"Had my first pedicure here with a good friend. We had Jamie and Zee and they were both AaMaaziing!!! First of all the place is beautiful and immaculate. Treated with champagne which can be bottomless BTW! Upgraded to the ice cream pedi and did not regret it, product was amazing. The girls were so fun and did a wonderful job. Will definitely be back!!",positive
I had the most amazing experience ever the staff was absolutely wonderful. Zee did a great job on my nails and I will Never go anywhere else! Hannah did a rockstar job!!! She hooked my husband up with a new due she is awesome this is my new favorite place to go!!!,positive
I went to the salon for a mani and pedi today and it was an amazing experience. The salon is absolutely beautiful and the staff is very friendly and professional. The massage chairs during the pedicure were very nice and gave you a nice soothing massage while you get your toes done. Z did my pedicure and she is an absolute doll. She was very professional and gave me an awesome foot massage too. Karla did my nails and she was a sweetheart. Both girls were great and I definitely will be coming back to this beautiful salon for all my beauty needs.,positive
Brittany did my hair and it is so beautiful! This salon is top notch. And so beautiful you feel like royalty every time you step in the door. Love this place I won't go anywhere else!,positive
This place is amazing!! I got.my haircut from Jamie and I must say it's probably the best haircut I have gotten. Make sure to stop by and check it out.,positive
Brittany cut my hair and gave me a mani/pedi. She is fantastic!! Highly recommend her. Finally found a great stylist! The salon is full service and super clean.,positive
"I recently got my hair cut and beard trimmed/styled here. The salon is very nice and provides a comfortable atmosphere. Jamie is terrific! She does a great job, and is extremely friendly and welcoming. It's like spending a half hour or so with an old friend who just happens to give great haircuts.",positive
"Scratch other spas and salons! This is it. Why oh why do not more of these places exist? Beautiful atmosphere, crystal chandeliers, smells like heaven. Lifestyle monthly memberships to fit every taste! Eyelash extentions with mink! Yes! Found my new happy place in the desert. Eileen is bomb diggity with pedicures. Hannah the OGM is fantastic....",positive
I recently experienced my first facial at this new salon. It was quiet a amazing experience! The staff was friendly and treated me very well! I was happy with the service and the special deals they had! They have full service of just about everything. Definitely will be going back to experience some of the other services that they offer.,positive
Amazing service. Aileen was my nail tech and she was very professional and did exactly what I asked for. Was also very fast. Great staff overall!,positive
I can't say enough good things about Jennifer - she is AMAZING. She has turned my hair into what i could only dream of before - she is incredible! Take my word for it....go to her! You wont be disappointed!,positive
"Jennifer is the hair goddess!! She is always so on point with what I want. She is super knowledgeable about anything relating to hair, beauty, and so much more. Her salon is always clean and super cute. She also sells her artwork which is super cute. I highly recommend her if you are looking for a new stylist.",positive
"Jennifer is amazing!!! Champange Strands is the perfect name for this salon since she specializes in blonde hair. I have always had long blonde hair for years. I decided about 2 years ago after lots of processing of my hair that I would go au nautrual. Recently, I went to my friends wedding and Jennifer had driven from Charlotte to about an hour and half away to do her hair and makeup. I new from that moment she was going to be my next stylist! My friend looked the best I have ever seen her in our 25 years of knowing one another. I could not be more pleased with how my ""champange strands"" turned out. She took the time to listen to what I truly wanted. I even still have extremely healthy hair. Not only is she a great stylist but she is sweet too! I will never go anywhere else but to see her. I have nothing but positive things to say!",positive
Jennifer is a true artist. She customizes the cut to your face structure and hair type and gives you color that works with your skin color. She is super relaxed and knows her stuff!,positive
Jennifer is awesome! She always does amazing with my cut and color and was absolutely beyond amazing doing my wedding updo and make up! Definitely worth the drive from Greensboro!,positive
You can rest assured that you're in good hands here! Jennifer is amazing at hair and makeup. I have long blonde hair and I'm very particular about my color. She made my hair look better than ever. If you're looking for a new and trendy place in the uptown Charlotte area then you definitely need to check this place out :),positive
"I am a terrible hair owner- the only thing I can ever be bothered to do with my hair is wash and sporadically brush it, and I generally only drag myself into a salon once or twice a year. Since I discovered Chic Effectz, I've been so much more motivated to get my hair done a bit more regularly, because this place not only does a wonderful job, but they don't over charge for their services. Because I neglect my locks, I usually need quite a bit of work done when I actually do get into a salon, and I have gotten a number of finger wags and ""tsk-tsk's"" from some stylists who assert that all hair must be cut every 6 to 8 weeks, which is probably an excellent habit but not one I will ever adopt for myself. There was no judgement from the stylists at Chic Effectz, however, and what I got instead was a comfortable atmosphere, pleasant conversation, and the exact hairstyle including hi-lights that I had asked for. I don't know for sure when I will next set foot in a hair salon, but I do know that when I do find my way back to a stylist's chair, it will be at Chic Effectz.",positive
I took my mother in for a wash and set. She was given a blow dry and iron as the stylist Mary Jo said she has been doing this since the 70s and knows how to do one as well as a set. It was a faster appointment for Mary Jo and only lasted less than 2 days and was a waste of mom's money. Also Mary Jo took a personal call while attending to my mother and stopped what she was doing for 10 minutes all the while leaning over my mom and resting her elbow on the shelf. She said it was a very important call about a quote for her backyard. Funny enough though when the salon phone rang she let it go to voicemail. When mom was paying the stylist shoved a card at me and said I should come by and try them out.........not a chance.,negative
"I was very disappointed with the ombre I got done. I had recently lost a lot of weight and really wanted something WAY different! I was told I could not do a bleach blonde but a caramel colour she would do. Since I always have caramel highlights put it I thought whatever. I was never showed the colour it would be, just went straight onto my hair before I even realized it. Anyways cost 200$ for nothing different, nobody noticed or anything. My friend said my ends looked a little light but that's it! Very very disappointed and felt like I was totally ripped off. Right after my appointment I drove straight to the reliable salon that I knew and the girl couldn't believe what was put in my hair as 'ombre'. Scheduled an appointment and will not return to Chic Effectz. Everyone that works there is nice but wouldn't recommend it to the younger clientele Middle age +",negative
Great place. Carol is a great stylist who listens to what you want and gives you the colour you ask for. She's also lovely to talk to - warm and gentle. They are all are so welcoming - makes you want to go back. Really look forward to my appointments. They also have a great sulphate free product line.,positive
"Went there because I bought a coupon for cut and colour, I didn't expect much because it's going to be a coupon service, however, after a brief chat about what colour and cut I wanted, Carol did exactly what I asked for, I was very happy coming out of her salon, I'd recommend it.",positive
Today Ashley worked miracles on the mess of hair I had. She took the time and listened to what I wanted and gave me advice on what I should do. I am so happy with the outcome and will always get my hair cut at Cleo's.,positive
I went here last week to get a digital perm. The staff were nice and they did a good job. It was worth to drove 22 miles to get my digital perm there!,positive
Friendly and fast service. $25 flat rate for women's hair curt. I was a bit nervous that there would be a language barrier but she was very respectful of what I wanted. Would definitely go here again.,positive
"I booked the same day appointment at Cleo Salon with Ashley, the best decision ever. She really took her time and cut my hair and listened what I want. I used to have to fly to LA for hair cut, but not any more now. Thanks for the service Ashley!",positive
They gave me the haircut i wanted Ashley Whenever i asked for the haircut i wanted at the other salons they always fucked up the length of my bangs but here they cut it to perfection First time here but GOD DAMN they good ~~~,positive
"I probably waited too long to post this but 2 weeks ago I got the Japanese straightening treatment I was worried the chemical used for the treatment would damage my hair a lot but nope it's fabulous and silky straight, I love it. I'm definitely coming back.",positive
I always come to Mr. Kim whenever I need a haircut because he is simply the best in the valley! I will not trust anyone else with my hair because he is the only one that gets it right every time. I would definitely recommend this place to everyone!,positive
I have recently moved to AZ and so glad I found Cleo beauty salon. Kim has done a wonderful hair cut and high light for me. Thank You Kim!!,positive
"Had my first digital perm few days ago. It turned out much better than I had hoped for. You can choose the size of the curls and since I had shoulder length hair, I opted for medium sized curls. Very pleased with how it turned out; not your traditional perm. It's what you call beach wave or curls you get with a curling iron, but right out of the shower. Very easy care as well. Just twirl your wet hair in large chunks and let it air dry. So simple. I am in love! Best part is my hair is still very healthy.",positive
"I love my hair color and haircut! Mr. Kim and Saki were very professional and very pleasant. Mr Kim did an excellent job and he knows exactly what I wanted to do with my hair. Not only that, he gives the best advice and he is upfront in telling you on what is good and damaging to your hair. Price is reasonable. Im happy and very satisfied with my hair. Will definitely recommend to my friends!!",positive
"They're one of the best I have been to in the Phoenix area. I had a haircut and digital perm today. The hair designer is so professional. He has been in the business for 27 years. He knows what to do. I was also impressed to hear that he had lived and worked in Japan before coming to AZ. Honestly, I feel like the price is a kind of expensive. But I was satisfied what I got. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PLACE.",positive
"I've been coming to this salon since I've moved to Arizona and have always remained loyal. This man seriously knows what he's doing. I barely have to tell him what I want done, yet he does exactly what I want and more. If you say you only want an inch off, he listens well and will only cut what you want. He is also the sweetest man. I could rave about how amazing this salon is all day. I highly recommend this salon to everybody! Y'all NEED to get your hair done here, if not... You're a fool.",positive
"As a Japanese, it was very difficult to find the suitable hairstylist in U.S who knows how to treat Asian hairs and Asian hair styling. He is very experienced with Asian hairs and styling and he speaks Japanese fluently so that I can communicate with him about my order in my own language smoothly! His cut is very quick and great quality! I truly recommend this salon to Asian girls especially! Thank you very much!",positive
"I knew I wanted The Japanese hair straightening treatment early last year so I thought I'd start saving up and growing out my hair. I'm a person who gets easily persuaded out of things and that's exactly what everybody was trying to do to me. I'm so glad I stuck to my gut and got this treatment done. I got it done on July 22 2015, I arrived 30 minutes early (due to not wanting to be late, because it's an hour drive) and mr Kim was more then generous to get started on me. He prices the treatment based on the length and density of your hair. (I have long frizzy thick curly hair) after an hour of working on my hair his wife showed up and they both went at it. And thank god because I was there for a total of 5 hours!! It's now the 25th and I just washed my hair for the first time and this is the best decision ever made!! TIPS. Buy a satin pillow to keep your hair looking brand new the two days you can't wash it. I will update my review in s week or so to let you guys know if I'm still able to curl and how it's holding up.",positive
"So I have tried many hair stylists in Phoenix and some have been ok. Generally, I have not been 100% satisfied with any of the cuts. Most stylists don't get that I need volume on top to balance out my round, asian face. I am half asian and really have had the best luck in the with asians cutting my hair. I did some research and found Kim. He is very nice, but take note - this guy has skills. He was trained at Vidal Sassoon in London so he knows what he is doing. The first time he cut my hair, admittedly it was too short, but even growing it out after 3 months - the style looked good. I went back for a trim and I was pretty clear about what I wanted to do (not go too short) and he nailed it. I am so happy with my cut. Even the people who color my hair were impressed with his technique. Most stylists in PHX do not have his level of skill and charge outrageous fees. A wash, cut and blowdry was $25 - you can't beat that with a stick. It is not a fancy salon, but I don't want to pay for atmosphere - I want a cut I am happy with. If that is your goal (Asian or not) Kim is worth visiting.",positive
"My first time here. I have very thick and coarse asian hair. I have another stylist that cuts my hair but at $75 for every monthly visit it gets expensive. So I ventured out and found Cleo. This isn't a 5 star luxury place, but he will listen to you, input his opinion and do the job right. I like how much lighter my hair feels. I look much younger now lol. The chair at the shampoo station is very comfortable. It's actually the same chair at the salon I used to go to. He's very fast. I will be gone for 2 months and when I come back I will try his deep conditioning treatment. Overall I'm very happy.",positive
"I have been straightening my hair from the last 10 years. Have tried a number of salons. As there were not many salons with experience in Phoneix, I usually used to get it straightened from LA or SFO. Thanks to Yelp I found Cleo Beauty salon. I am so glad to find some one so much closer. The owner Kim who did the straightening uses Yuko and seems to have good amount of experience using the product. They were quite meticulous going through each step with a lot of care. The end result is really impressive. Yuko is a great product and with the right stylist the outcome would be great. Though Kim doesn't have yuko conditioner or shampoo, I would recommend getting those products from amazon or any other retailer. It smells great and is really good for chemically straightened hair. I highly recommend this salon.",positive
"This is a really good place. I've had my hair digitally permed four times now and he has done the best job of all the others. I like the team of husband and wife working together it did help it go quicker. He also really did understand what he was doing, he took his time trimming and a layering it so that it would lay nicely when it was permed. And it was also cheaper than the others even though he took just as much time to really cut it and blow dry it and stylet. Looking to find this so close to my house.",positive
I am completely happy with the results. The Salon owner cut my hair and did a great job. Making this place my Salon for all my future hair needs.,positive
Been coming here for many years for the Asian straight perm.. Never fails! Hair is so silky smooth. He is always looking for the best hair products to use on his clients. I enjoy when his wife washes my hair..feels like a nice head massage lol.,positive
"I had the best experience here. It's not fancy or anything, but Mr Kim is incredible. He's got decades of experience, studied in London. He's the only stylist I would trust in the state to do Japanese Thermal Straightening (Yuko) on my hair. Now my hair air dries sleek and gorgeous, and so shiney! And it was so affordable! I will drive the 45 minutes every time - so worth it!",positive
"I just went to Cleo Salon to get my hair cut for the first time. Hands down, I got the best haircut of my life. A friend recommended Cleo Salon months ago and I am kicking myself for not making an appointment sooner. The other reviews are pretty much spot on. The salon is located in an unassuming strip mall in Glendale and is far from the posh salons in Scottsdale and other areas of Phoenix. What you get is friendly, professional service from someone who is truly an expert in Asian hair. I called earlier today and was able to get a same day appointment for this afternoon. When I arrived, there were a few other clients in the salon, but I had only a momentary wait. A woman washed my hair and the stylist, Mr. Kim, was ready to cut my hair as soon as I was done with the shampoo. As soon as he started working on my hair, it was clear that he ""got it,"" in terms of what I was looking for in a style. The wash, cut, and blow dry took about 25 minutes and cost a total of $20. Overall, I had an incredibly positive experience and will be going back there in a month or two for another cut.",positive
"I love Mr. Kim! I was so scared to digiperm my hair for the first time ever...or to really just do anything with my hair because I'm obsessed with healthy smooth hair, but honestly this was the best decision I've ever made, hair-wise haha. I repermed my hair after about 6 months, because my hair is naturally super straight. My hair felt slightly dry at first which was suspected due to the chemicals, but after a week or two it was back to it's normal smooth silky self :)! I also washed my hair every day, so maybe for those who do the ""every other day washing"" routine, it may last longer than 6 months before you are just left with waves instead of bouncy curls. Mr. Kim advised me to blow-dry and twist with your fingers to give it that curling iron curl look...but I personally do not like blow-drying unless really necessary. I simply combed through my hair with my fingers in the shower or a large tooth comb and scrunched it while air-drying. Definitely the only salon I will go to for digital perming.",positive
"Today it was my second visit to this salon. Actually this time I was visiting in from North Carolina just for 2 days and visiting Cleo was one of my top priorities of this trip since I can't find awesome hair stylist like Mr. Kim in my new area. Last September I got digital perm - outcome was gorgeous and long-lasting. I have received many many compliments. Today I got just a hair cut, which revived my digital perm nicely :) Mr. Kim has long experience doing digi perm both in Japan and in this country, it makes him pick right amount of time etc to make a desired style. I guess I will fly back to AZ again for my next digi perm!",positive
"I lived in South Korea for a year, which is where I got my first Japanese Hair Straightening. My hair has a very thick wave in the back that is hidden by a layer of straight hair. I have tried the Brazilian Blowout on my hair twice and not noticed any change (and it's more expensive). Since being back in the states, I decided that I needed to find somewhere to get my hair straightened since my own hair stylist doesn't do this. I found Cleo Beauty Salon and it was just like being back in Korea. Mr. Kim and his wife, who run the salon, are both Korean and fabulous at what they do. I HIGHLY recommend them!!! My hair looks fantastic, and that's saying a lot! It was well worth the $150 and 3.5 hours. Beware of other salons that want to charge anywhere from $400-900 depending on length and thickness.... I doubt there's a difference and why pay more when Cleo's does a fabulous job! I will most certainly be back to do this again once my roots grow out.",positive
"Just got a digital perm today. Took 2 hours and half. Although I got a better and bigger curls else where 8 months ago (which lasted for a good 6 months) in San Diego, this place is good. The only con is that my hair is a lot dryer which is expected from and it's not as the big curly wave (should have went with my instinct by using the big roller instead. Kim recommended medium roller so that the curl wouldn't be lose). Ps: I have very thick wavy hair and I posted my result :)..",positive
I recently had a digital perm done here and I absolutely love the results! Mr. Kim is very talented. I will definitely return in the future for another perm!,positive
"My haircut was awesomely done, Shampoo+cut+blowdry for $20. Price was very reasonable and the staff were friendly. I now know where to go for my regular haircuts. I'm going to try their magic hair treatment next year and write about it when I get it done.",positive
"I'm so glad I found this salon!!! After getting my hair burned last year & then finding out that Hair City in Phoenix closed I wasn't sure where to go to get my hair magic straightened. I even debated driving out to LA to get my hair done in Koreatown. But luckily I received a referral to Cleo's from a Korean restaurant and so I went here and am glad I did! I got my hair magic straightened (aka japanese straightened) and the stylist did a great job. Although my hair didn't come out perfectly, I blame myself because I recently had my hair highlighted at an american salon and apparently the american salon used bleach in my hair. And bleach plus magic will frizz hair. I learned this from the stylist at Cleo. I have to give extra credit to the stylist at Cleo, because he kept asking me if I had used bleach in my hair for highlights. And I kept telling him no, but he kept asking so I finally called the salon where I had my hair highlighted where they told me that they do use bleach when highlighting! (unsure why they didn't use regular color since I was complaining about how my old highlights had turned yellow, and now my new highlights are turning yellow too! I think bleach highlights is too hard on my hair). I'm really glad the Cleo stylist was so adamant on finding out if bleach was used on my hair, otherwise I would have had a hair disaster this year (like I did last year!-- and no I did not have highlights on my hair last year, last year my hair was in perfect condition, no treatments had been done on my hair.) I also saw that Cleo has machines for digital perms too. I might have to try this next year after I grow my hair out (since my hair is currently shorter than usual because of the disaster from last year) Go here get your hair done by an expert. He told me he was trained in both Korea & Japan. So he speaks Korean, Japanese, & English. I believe magic straight costs about $150, at least that's what I paid. And digital perm costs around $130",positive
"Small salon located on Thunderbird Rd across from ASU West. They're very accommodating. Mr. Kim trained at Vidal Sassoon, Toni&Guy, and 8 years in Japan. He uses Japanese hair manicure products. Reasonable prices! And for my Japanese peeps he speaks Japanese.",positive
This place has decent products for hair. The prices are more expensive than you can source elsewhere. (eg. Eglinton West salons). Had a hair appointment with Aisha. I was totally underwhelmed given her cocky attitude and lack of styling abilities.,negative
"Never mind what I said in my last review. They are really rude here. They think it's cute, but it's dumb and cheap to act rude and weird with customers. Like what are you doing? If you hate your job and you hate the customers then bounce. They're so awkward here. One time one girl was great. That's it. I'm done. I'll go back though because they're cheap.",negative
"I was a little apprehensive in making an in-store trip after reading Yelp reviews regarding the poor attitudes of store associates. However - I found the associates to be approachable. A young woman asked an associate for assistance and she was helped right away. I found every item on my list (which was quite exciting) and headed to the cash register. Kyesha was friendly and signed me up for the Clore points club. Good looking out. I don't know about its hair selection as I don't know the first thing about wigs and weaves. But it's a large store with plenty of hair care items (shampoos, conditioners, cowashes, hot oils, relaxer kits, deep conditioners, etc). It's filled with American hair products - a little overpriced but the selection is great. All in all it was a great experience.",positive
"Very shitty customer service! The girls look at you as though they don't want to work (except one with the natural caesar haircut, she's cool), especially, the one with the fake Yaki. Ms. ma'am! Nobody cares about your man problems! Either get rid of him or purchase a B.O.B. (battery operated boyfriend). When they do decide to work, they just monitor your activity to avoid theft. Half the products there are counterfeit and they don't do exchanges fairly. I went to purchase a shampoo, didn't use it nor open it, return to the store the next day and the store manager said that it was used so she didn't accept the return it. I mentioned to her my hair is unwashed how can you validate it, then she changes her excuse and mentions it's a final sale. After I countered her statement by simply stating there was no stamp on my receipt disclaiming final sale nor no communication from the cashier regarding final sale, she simply just said no I can't exchange nor return. I peacefully left and never returned the store. Please be cautious regarding where you are investing your money. Your money should equate to good, quality product and customer service.",negative
"I agree with you Nisha D. For the past year or so the service has been horrible. I've only had 2 experiences that were considered Ok. The management can't seem to handle the staff they hire, the girls are blatantly rude and abrasive with customers. Don't ask questions about the products because you WILL be ignored. We should boycott the store, there's no reason to give money to people who can't train their staff or discipline them after a complaint is being made. You walk into the store in a happy mood and leave feeling shattered by the rudeness and the lack of customer service training.",negative
"I've ordered twice more since my last review and service remains consistently fast and accurate. Always with a bunch of new samples. Shipping is pricy so I always spend the minimum for free shipping ($75). Whoops, I'm a bit of a beauty junkie:)",positive
Love this place! The girls here know hair. Very friendly and knowledgeable staff. The staff takes their time with clients. My favorite place in Toronto!!!,positive
"Great stock and variety for different hair types, decent prices plus a really convenient location!! The cashiers were really pleasant. Other staff could stand to undergo a bit of customer service training but all in all, shopping here is a good experience. I would definitely recommend their store.",positive
"Don't go here unless you want to get yelled at for trying to exchange a DEFECTIVE product. Staff is rude and just rolled their eyes when asking to speak to a manager. Eventually after having to explain my situation to the manager (who I had to approach myself) many times over, and having her staff raise their voice at me, I eventually received a replacement for the defective product. As a professional make up artist and hairstylist, I need to spend a lot of money on hair supplies, but I will certainly not be doing it here any longer. There are many other places to shop for these things in Toronto, and I recommend that you do it elsewhere. Highly reccomended is Ragga Beauty Supply.",negative
"Went in with an old balayage that I wanted gone. Asked to get an ombré that faded from my naturally black hair into a brown and then a darker blonde (I even showed pictures). I told her Im not a fan of the way blonde looks on my skin tone so I wanted more of a brown COLOR than the blonde. The first time she bleached and toned it (for maybe two minutes before she immediately washed it out) it came out horribly blonde all over my head and she asked if I was happy and I almost jumped out of the chair. I told her that's not what I wanted and once again showed her the picture. She then went and asked her coworker what to do and toned my hair again. At this point she tried to do the same thing again and tone my hair for like 5 minutes and when I told her I wanted it darker she was like ""well that sounds right"". I'd had my hair done professionally before and I knew it would take anywhere from 20-45 minutes to tone me down to a darker blonder. She never applied color to my hair and so when I left it was not what I wanted but I initially thought something I could live with. I got home and washed my hair and realized she did no blending and where she had bleached my hair on the front of my head (if I had bangs it would be my bangs) she never blended so it looked like I had three months of outgrowth and didn't get my hair done the day before. I ended up going to a Supercuts to get it redone and they did a great job coloring my hair into an ombré and getting rid of the bad blend job. I don't think she actually knew how to do ombré and if so she shouldn't have agreed to doing that on my hair. The haircut was nice and that's about all I have to say that was good about the experience.",negative
Took my daughter for first time great service and did awesome job with her nails . She was extremely happy and will be bringing her back for her hair. Professional and I believe in supporting local businesses,positive
Hand Down best hairstylist in Town all the girls are amazing. Very talented group of young ladies with a great environment.,positive
Sendy has been my stylist for quite some time now. She is experienced and knows how to take care of my hair! Check her salon out!,positive
"If your looking for a forever hairstylest you can definitely find her here! MYROSE is great with color,cuts!! She really takes her time and gives you what you want without damaging your hair! She's amazing!!!",positive
"All I have to say is Myrose. She is the only person allowed to touch my hair. I started going to her for over a year now and I am obsessed. They way she cuts and colors hair is amazing. I had never colored my hair before until just recently, and she did an amazing ombré on me. My sister and about five other friends go to her as well. This place is fairly new and beyond underrated. Hair cuts are affordable (make sure to tip well) and the staff is friendly. They provide free wifi, coffee and water. Thank you Myrose for being the best hair dresser I've ever had.",positive
"Went in a month ago for a simple haircut, and Myrose took care of me, she was very nice and welcoming since it was my first time there. She did a fabulous job, she recommended to do a blow out and I loved it!! I felt fabulous, my sister went in last week with stylist Sendy for an ombré and she gets compliments on the daily about her hair. I went in again today to cut my daughters hair and to put in some color on mine and I'm in love all over again! Sendy did my hair this time, and I highly recommend her, overall a Very nice staff and very affordable, I even got a glass of wine;)",positive
"The 2 times I was able to get in to have my son's haircut, it was done well. However, I have called the shop repeatedly to make appointments and there is never any answer and no return phone call after i've left multiple messages. I decided to just stop by one day (during regular business hours, which are clearly posted on the door of the shop) and it was NOT open. I drove a fairly far distance to get my son's haircut for nothing. I called the shop immediately to leave a message and even THAT message was never returned. This is horrible business and the shop owners should be ashamed that they run their business in this manner. If something crazy is happening in the owner's life, where she was literally unable to be at the store that day or any other day, she should make return phone calls to explain. Things happen and I get that, absolutely - however, that did not happen. Very disappointed.",negative
"Tara does a great job cutting my son's hair. However, they never answer the phone or return phone calls. One day I drove by in hopes to schedule an appointment. There was a family waiting at the door. Tara had no showed. The shop was closed, and nobody was there to cut their child's hair as promised. I left, then drove by a second time the same day, after my errand was complete at another store. Another family was again waiting outside the door. Nobody was there for the appointment they had scheduled. I'm not sure how this shop will stay in business.",negative
"This is the ONLY place I go to get my sons (2yr old) haircut!! He has been going here for over 6 months! Tara is Amazing!! She is extremely patient with my son who wiggles and screams in his seat almost the entire time! She uses scissors for all of his hair except to trim around the ears and neckline! I really don't know how she does it!! As far as the comments about answering the phone, I have been in the salon when the phone rings and she doesn't leave her client to answer the phone when it rings... Which I find to be very respectful! So if you call and it doesn't ring... Try again later because she is probably with a client. I have been to other places to try and get my sons haircut and they won't even try because he starts to cry. So thank you Tara for your Patience and GREAT cuts!",positive
"Nice folks, kids like getting haircuts here. I usually get mine cut as well since I""m already there. We're regulars here.",positive
"This salon ROCKS!!! Hands down! Myself, three boys and even my husband have been attending this salon for over six years now. All the stylist are very professional and do a fabulous job! They take their time to make kids of all ages comfortable; which is more than I can say for the place we went to prior to coming to Comb-A-Cabana. I should also mention that I live in Cave Creek and it is WELL worth the drive!!",positive
"I won't be going back. My son's hair was butchered. I'm not exaggerating! Several people commented on how terrible it looked. I had to go out and buy scissors to fix it. Since we left the shop with his hair wet it was hard to tell it was so messed up. I mean different lengths, rat tails, just awful. My daughter got a trim and that went well. They barely took anything off and I think it would be impossible to mess that up. They put a little braid in her hair and that was cute. This place is probably fine for a trim. Maybe we just got a bad hair stylist. I know we didn't get the one that everyone is raving about on here.",negative
"My 6 year old boy/girl twins have been going to Tara for at least 3+ years & look forward to getting their hair cut! For the first couple years we went to another popular franchised ""kids"" place (similar to this place where kids sit in a race car chair & watch a kiddie video) but with disasterous results. And it was twice as expensive. The kind you look back on and wince at photos because the hairdresser looks like they used a large bowl to cut their hair. Not Tara! She always asks just before she is done how mom likes it (I usually ask for a little more taken off with my sons pointy back nape) and, I get compliments about their haircuts too. When Tara has time she usually puts sparkle hairspray or a few cute braids or mini ponietails in the front bang area. Bonus! And all for a very cheap price. Did I mention the free lollipop at the end? What more could you ask for in a kids hair place! Oh and she cut my hair once when I was in a pinch. :) :)",positive
"This place rocks! Yesterday was our first visit to Comb-A-Cabana. Our 3 year old has never been good getting a haircut. In fact, he's been awful. I'm sure you all know what I'm talking about- the ""kicking, screaming, you must be trying to kill me with the comb"" type. Our anxiety levels rose as we were approaching another dreaded haircut, but their place was just different. It was down to earth and relaxing. They had lots of toys for our son to play with while waiting. When it was his turn, our son refused to go to the chair so Lacy did his haircut right there at the train table. She also avoided the spray bottle since that would upset him more. Even two older kids that were there were really getting into making his experience better and were blowing bubbles to entertain him. The entire experience was just so awesome. I was just so pleased that they were accommodating to his needs and for the first time ever we had a tear free haircut. And FYI, for the little ones that are willing to make it to the chair, they have a large TV with movies playing and a fire truck or car to sit in. They also had regular chairs for the older kids. We will make this our regular hair cutting place for sure!!!",positive
"Miss Tara has been cutting my 3 kids hair for over a year and does a consistent fabulous job! She is patient and listens to exactly what you want your kids hair cut to look like. You can't beat the price and the kids love to play video games while getting their hair done. In fact, I love her so much she now cuts & colors MY hair! She has over 18 years experience and is a color magician!! Make an appointment with Tara and you will not be disappointed.",positive
"I love this place, specially now that it has been remodeled and the best two stylist stayed (this used to be Snip-A-Dee-Doo-Dah). Ms. Tara and Ms. Julie are really great. The salon is airy and fresh looking, and has a nice playing area for the kids as well as TV and DVD players for them to watch movies while getting their hair cut. Today my little girl had the works, she even let her hair be wash in the ""big girls"" sink. Ms. Julie finished her cut and made a beautiful braided crown and put little flowers around. She looked adorable. My little boy, well there is not much to do with a boy, but he got his hair cut nicely and spiked. Total rocker.",positive
A great value for a far superior hair cut than are likely to get from a national chain. We have been going to Tara for 3 years and she has created a warm and friendly environment that kids love. There are plenty of TV's for kids to watch a show if they are not big fans of haircuts.,positive
"Had my sons first haircut here, the staff was very friendly and made our experience great! They put on a movie and let him play around in the chair before getting started so he would feel more comfortable. I traveled from Tucson to this location just to get his haircut and it was worth it. With his first hair cut they gave us a certificate to place a picture into accompanied by the first lock of his hair they cut off! Overall great experience, would recommend.",positive
We had such a great experience here. Decided to take our toddler here after a not so great experience at a grown up barbershop. We made an appointment with Heather. We were late but she didn't mind. She put on Elmo for him and was so incredibly sweet. He got the coolest haircut!! I was nervous taking him to a kids place thinking they couldn't give him the kind of cut I wanted but it looked better than the grown man barbershop. We will definitely be back to see Heather!,positive
"Made a same day appointment for my son, I was honestly hesitant t because of the reviews, but so often people only the post the negative. And the place is close, so I thought I'd give it a try. Tarin (I think that's her name) did a great job. She was interactive w my little guy, followed my instructions perfectly. She wasn't pushy, she wasn't rude, she did exactly what I asked for. We will definitely be going back! Thanks so much guys!",positive
"My son just got his first hair cut here, HORRIBLE HAIR CUT! It is so uneven, not even close to what I asked for. Never coming here again! STAY AWAY! Trust me people choose any other place but this one. His hair cut is soooo horrible its embarrassing and I feel like I'm going to cry and barf. Stay away.",negative
"First haircut today with my toddler. Fantastic experience! Maribel did wonderful. She was patient and kind. Her haircut was fantastic too. She gave him a ""1st haircut certificate"". So glad I came here. Ask for Maribel!",positive
"Recently went here for a hair cut and after she shaved half my son's head she stopped and said that she could not finish his haircut because he had head lice. I paid for the hair cut (she shaved the bottom part of his head)and then She had me buy a 25.00 bottle of lice shampoo (that I returned). When we left we looked at my son's head and we did not see anything other than what looked like flakes. We took him to another salon where they looked at his head and said they did not see lice and they finished his hair cut. We also had the school do a check the next morning and yet again got the reply no he does not have lice. Here is the reply from the school ""Hello the nurse given the all clear so no worries I think that woman just over reacted so anyway talk at talk to you later. Bye bye. "" . We will not be taking our son here again.",negative
"We have been to this location a handful of times and always have had a positive experience. Yesterday, I took my daughter in and it was terrible. Carla was the stylist on the floor and while she was nice, she did an awful job cutting my daughters hair. I asked for her to trim off about 1.5 inches and add in some light textured layers to help lift my daughters curls. Since my daughter is 7 I didn't want to hoover, so I sat up front. I was shocked by how awful the cut was. The layers looked hacked and her hair was crooked (which she corrected upon pointing it out). I didn't say anything, because I didn't want to upset my daughter. Thank goodness hair grows... just not fast enough so save my daughter from the butcher job.",negative
"My husband took our son to get a haircut at the Scottsdale location, and I thought it would be an awesome quality of haircut due to the environment and reviews. I was so disappointed and upset, his haircut was HORRIBLE! Patchy, not even, and just an awful cut! I don't think it's even worth going back! So disappointing!",negative
"My son and I love this place. Marissa is thee best. The first time she cut my son's hair, I was totally amazed at the great job she's done. I've gone to other places and many others have cut my son's hair. I do not trust anyone else and done with the awful and disappointing haircuts. She is such a sweet heart and great with kids. This evening there were three kids ahead of us. We didn't have an appointment and Marissa was the only one working. She was totally courteous and worth the wait.",positive
"My 4year old asked if she could get her haircut so I brought her here. The lady we had was very rude. She was very short with my daughter and not ""kid friendly"". My daughter wanted her haircut to above her shoulders. When the lady said she was done I noticed there were obvious pieces that were longer and I asked her to fix them. She then got out an electric razor to apparently fix the pieces and used it on the rest of her head/neck. She told my daughter it might tickle. My daughter was being very still and cooperative up until this point and was very distracted watching her movie. When she started using the electric razor my daughter started occasionally jerking her head and the lady was getting very short with her saying ""stay still it only tickles"". After about the 4th jerk my daughter starts crying (very unlike her!). At the same time the stylist said she was done. I got my daughter out of the chair and noticed multiple cuts on her neck. No wonder my daughter cried, she was being cut! The stylist didn't stop to look at what she was doing or if she was cutting her, instead she kept telling my daughter to stop moving it only tickled! I then told the stylist she cut her and this was the only time I hear a ""kid friendly"" voice come out and she said ""oh I'm so sorry"" and she put some powder on her neck. I then proceeded to pay full price for this traumatic haircut. At home I still had to fix my daughters hair as it was still very uneven. I notified the manager of this event through the website and I got an email back saying she will speak with her staff about the situation and to please call her or email her with anything further. She did leave her phone number but no email (it came from a ""do not reply"" email so I could not just reply to it). I wanted to send her the pictures of my daughters neck so I called to talk with her on the phone and get an email address for her but never got a call back. I am so disappointed with the whole situation and the lack of being able to contact the manager. I will not be going back here! I will post a picture of my daughters neck in the photo section.",negative
"I tried to make an appointment for my son's first haircut. The lady on the phone was rude! They are out of certificates, so she told me I would have to come back a 2nd time to complete the package I was going to pay for. I asked if they could just mail it to me. Nope. Ty but I believe in good customer service and will take my son and money else where!",negative
"My son needed his first haircut and someone had recommended cool cuts, I was skeptical because the not so great reviews- but I'm glad I went anyway. I made an appointment and they got me in in an hour. When I got there no customers were there so we wouldn't have even had to wait. Yasmine was amazing- she put in a movie and made sure he was happy the whole time. In the end I didn't have a screaming baby (he was very happy in fact) and the haircut looked great. I would recommend taking your kids here, I know I'll go back.",positive
"I had a perfectly lovely experience here for my daughters first haircut! She is 3 and given the reviews I read I was on guard and prepared for the worst but I also know the bad experiences get posted and not always the good so I took a shot. The 2 stylists were very nice and when they saw my daughter they ""fought"" over who got to give her a cut. Julia ""won"" and let my baby pick out a movie and a car to sit in (she picked the train). Since my daughters hair texture is a lot like mine I gave her my thoughts on what should be done and listened to everything I said and we ended up with a beautiful cut. She then styled my girls hair with a cute side braid (which I could never ever do myself) and let her pick out a colored ribbon (green). I will for sure come back and will probably have Julia style her hair before our next family photos are taken. We did get the first haircut keepsake as promised as well. Nothing fancy but it was nice to get it. So for you worried moms I say give them a chance. They exceeded my expectation.",positive
It was my sons first haircut and we decided on a whim to try you out since we were in the area. It was a little busy when we got there but I realize that we didn't have an appointment and we had a waiting time. When we were next the lady was super friendly and very talkative which is great for kids! My son did so well for his first haircut and you made it a good experience. Thank you.,positive
"In my opinion, they did not have good customer service. We arrived and no one immediately checked us in. There were 3 people working there and no one was waiting. By checking in, I am referring to them registering us, taking our name etc. The lady in charge asked if we were a walk in or an appointment. Once we told them we were a walk-in, she didn't say anything else to us. One employee said she would check us in but then ignored us for another 10 minutes. They didn't tell us how long the next appointment would be. I think one of their clients may have had lice. They were selling a lice shampoo and instructing the parent how to apply it and pointed to the boy's scalp. After we got up left. No one followed us or attempted to ask why we were leaving. I know lice is common among children but it can be highly contagious. This was my perception of the situation and I cannot say for a fact the child had lice. And although I have no information regarding their sanitary/hygiene procedures, I personally did not feel comfortable having my child's hair cut there afterward. We chose to leave. Finally, their prices were expensive in my opinion. For their ""supreme haircut"" it was 18.95 not including tax or trip. I took my child to a salon and paid $30. For 12 dollars more, my child received great customer service and had their hair cut by a stylist with shampoo and rinse.",negative
"Not recommended, took both my kids here, my son's haircut went well however the lady that cut my daughters hair was terrible, super lazy couldn't even put her little locks into a ponytail.... She had the nerve to ask me to do it, which I actually did end up fixing it anyways.... Very disappointing",negative
"We are new to the area and I went here to get my sons hair cut. He is 2 and back home I would take him to a similar place because he would sit still since there are toys and animals to sit on and she trimmed his hair just right. The lady was super friendly with my son here- blew bubbles, talked silly to him etc. great. But he cut. Looked fine there because she put gel in it and slicked it back plus he would no longer sit still. When I got home my husband asked who put a bowl on his head. He was right. Terrible cut. Uneven bangs. blah. And the lady was kind of pushy, very friendly, but pushy with her products. My two year old does not need gel or spray. Won't be back :/",negative
"The person who used to cut our children's hair has left. I think her name was Shawna? Shawna was amazing. She was personable, gentle and understanding of my sons' needs, and she always gave great hair cuts. Shawna please tell us where you are! Our last two visits to Cool Cuts 4 Kids were not good experiences. The two ladies who work there now are unprofessional. One woman kept talking with the other about her very personal health issues in front of my children which they had all kinds of questions about later. The other lady is rude and handles the boys roughly while speaking in a fake sweet voice. One time she even told my sensitive son that he needs to be tougher. The rude lady does not know how to operate their gaming systems which is the only reason why my sons were willing to get their hair cut there; therefore now that Shawna is gone, the games were the only reason I was willing to drive 20min and pay for a mediocre haircut there. One of my sons was in tears when we got home after the last cut because the hair dresser butchered his hair so badly. He gets upset everytime he looks in the mirror and is refusing to ever get his haircut again. Obviously, we won't be back.",negative
"The woman who usually cuts our child's hair wasn't there and the person who seemed to be in charge was SO abrasive. I knew before the cut started that this would be a mistake. Our child has Down Syndrome and can be a handful, but the more-experienced stylist was always so good with him and did such a fantastic job. I'll complete the haircut myself! After coming here for years, we will be going elsewhere. We were driving half an hour to come here, but would drive an hour for better service and understanding.",negative
"The first time I took my son here, he had gotten a really bad cut elsewhere. Not only did they fix his bad haircut, but were great with him. We came today ten minutes before the closed and were in and out with a great haircut. Thanks for being great with the little ones!!!!!",positive
"Woman working on Saturday 8/8/15 was incredibly unprofessional, abrasive, and rude. Still, My daughter and I waited for 10 minutes. We left when we overheard her being rude to another client. We'll never go back.",negative
The girl at the front desk was rude and unprofessional! We walked out and didn't get a haircut for my daughter. She had an attitude right when we walked in. Will not be going back. First impression was terrible!,negative
"I took my daughter here to get her hair cut, we were a walk in bad had very little time but she had been begging for months to get a cut so I figured fine!! Her hair is down to her bum and we wanted a cute shoulder length Bob the woman who did her hair wasn't very pleasant, she kept telling me she couldn't really cut her without washing it which is false, 1st use a spray bottle and if this was the case don't offer a cut price that does not include the wash, she kept going on and on until I was like ""fine"" just to shut her up, I should have just left at that point bc my stylist dry cuts my hair all the time to make sure it's stays the length I want so I should have known she would be inadequate!!! After everything was said and done my daughter had waist length hair basically just chopped to her shoulders, I asked for layers there were none, I asked for a bob...there wasn't one!!! I could have saved $22 dollars and dos that hack job myself ended up taking my crying butt and my crying daughters butt across town to an actual stylist at Madisons and have them fix it! They did bc they are amazing and I went across town to request my money back only to be told the manager has to be the one to authorize and that the manager was gone and the manager was the woman who had butchered my daughters hair and then I was told that if I had a problem she could have fixed it (um yeah right like I would let anyone else there touch her)Yes the place is cute but this girl had zero hair cutting abilities!!! Beware talent is lacking and prices are high!!!",negative
"This is an awesome place to get your child's hair cut. My ten year old son was given a very vesitile, cool cut.Yasmine is a wonderful stylist who truly cares.",positive
Awesome place to take your child for his or her first hair cut. the guy who cut my 1 yr olds hair was great with kids. they have cute seats for the kids to sit in and play disney movies to keep them occupied.,positive
"We love this place. We went a few months ago for my son's first hair cut and they were very accommodating with us wanting to keep as much of his hair as possible, even with it being a Sunday they were very patient. I came back last week to get my handsome guy a trim and was more than blown away. His stylist was Jazmine. She was very friendly and kept her attention on Declan the whole time. I could go to any kid based salon, but I will continue to bring him here because of their customer service.",positive
"Have been to other locations before and loved it, so I thought I would try this one. My son has a different hairstyle than most boys (surfer shag type) and MANY hairstylists have messed it up tragically before, so when I called to make an appt, I asked who would be best to cut his hair......considering they had NO idea what I was talking about, I won't be risking trying them out.",negative
The atmosphere is perfect for kids and the service and actual hair cut are always exceptional. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND making an appointment before coming in. They are always busy! My kids love the little car chairs and all of the stylists use words that kids can understand. They also have awesome hair products for kids as well as toys to bribe or reward!,positive
"As soon as we got here, I knew...this was a fun place for kids. Lots of toys, movies, video games. I had my 4 year old son and my 18 month old daughter (her first haircut) and we got a super nice lady who made the experience so easy for my little girl. She did an amazing job and we got a little memento of her first haircut. I highly recommend this place!",positive
"Time flies when you're having fun...2 years hence and I still take the sparkly offspring here. Other reviewer is absolutely correct, especially on the weekend, if you don't have an appointment you'll have a serious wait. I tend to go weekdays after work and its relatively quiet. Even then, I call for the appointment first. Its still a very fine hair cut and I know what to expect - the goob seems to enjoy the fact that he can play Sonic while his head is otherwise engaged. If we went more often I'd probably rethink the expense because it is $17.95 plus tip. For now, its worth it.",positive
After trying to color my hair myself I found Copectic and Marie! Marie is fabulous and listened to what I wanted to do and the end result was amazing!! The salon is very comfortable and has a great feel to it! Beverages and snacks are offered as well. They do all kinds of hair treatments as I have noticed quite a lot of fabulous before and afters! Below is a photo of my freshly colored hair. Love the multi dimension colors in it! Perfect every time! Try Marie and you won't be disappointed!,positive
"Love this place! First time there yesterday - Jessica was a good listener, she made great suggestions, and I ended up with a fabulous haircut, color that I love and subtle balayage highlights that really upped the style quotient for my hair. Will definitely be back.",positive
Absolutely loved this place!!!!! Everyone was super friendly and welcoming. I was a new customer from out of state and they got me in that day!! I told Alexis (my stylist) what I wanted and she did it perfectly!!!! She had a great personality:) I would highly recommend this place to any and everyone!!!!,positive
"I only get my hair cut at Copacetic. I currently live in Phoenix, AZ and as soon as I know when I am coming back to Pittsburgh I immediately call to schedule an appointment with Missy. Missy is fantastic and so great. I always leave the salon happy and am never disappointed. The lounge is very relaxing and not loud, so you are able to relax and enjoy the pampering. Every stylist at Copacetic is very welcoming and friendly, makes you feel at ease. I highly recommend going to Copacetic to get your hair done.",positive
"I recently moved to the North Hills and desperately needed a new hair salon. I made an appointment with Mallory for a cut and balayage and she nailed it. Prices were great, space is amazing and everyone there was so friendly. I've definitely found my new spot!",positive
Love the staff and location. Missy has been doing my hair for years. I am a blonde and A LOT of people can not get the color right but she does every time. The salon is super cute and atmosphere is relaxing with refreshments. Highly recommend anyone looking for a new stylist as the entire staff is great!,positive
"I went there because of the high reviews. The girl who did my hair was super sweet but turned it that brassy gold shade of blonde that I hate even after showing pictures of what I wanted (very light soft blonde). I was there all afternoon into the evening and it still was not what I wanted. Had to go to another salon to have it fixed although they offered to fix it, I was too afraid. Will be going back to my girl from home who charges 1/4 the price.",negative
All I have to say is Valeria is DA BOMB!!! She is absolutely amazing. I am working through a color correction and she has done an amazing job. She is pragmatic and makes sure to communicate expectations and potential issues. She is thorough and works amazingly well under pressure of the unknown of color corrections. Everyone at the salon is amazing.,positive
"I came into this salon with a recommendation to see Missy, however due to the holiday I was put in to see Caroline. The receptionist spoke highly of her ability to do highlights. I needed a slightly tacky highlighting job fixed up, and she most definitely delivered. My color looks amazing, my cut looks amazing, and everyone in the salon was very chatty and friendly. I'm so excited to have found my new salon. Plus they have a dog in the salon so I really don't know what more you could ask for!",positive
I had my hair cut and balayage by Marie a couple weeks ago. I'm absolutely in love with the color! She did an amazing job blending so it looks natural and vibrant. She works meticulously and was so sweet and accommodating even when my appt ran long. Highly recommend this salon and Marie!,positive
"Yesterday I had my hair done by Valarie. It was my first time to the salon! I had an awful experience at another salon in the area and had bad highlights and over processed hair. Valarie took on the challenge. We talked about what I wanted and what was realistic. She is a magician! She took the time, listened to me and fixed my hair to EXACTLY what I wanted! This is best cut and color I have ever had. My hair is smooth, shiny and healthy feeling. I have gone to a few of the salons in the North Hills and Copacetic is 10x better than the rest. My hair was a disaster and now it's exactly how I wished it would be! I would ABSOLUTELY recommend anyone in PGH to give them a try. You will be so glad you did. They are tucked in Pines plaza and if you blink you'll miss them. When you walk in the place is so cool looking, very chill and modern. All the stylists are friendly and every customer I saw around me looked awesome when they were done! They offer you beverages and ask you frequently if you're comfortable. Restrooms are very clean and pretty (that's a huge plus in my book, i'm weird) Love this place, love the stylists! Oh and Eddie is so adorable!!! I will keep coming back for the rest of forever.",positive
"This is easily my favorite salon!! The atmosphere is so positive, the workers are so friendly, and I LOVE my hair stylist! Ask for Caroline- she does an AMAZING job!",positive
"I would give this salon a 5 plus. After reading a number of the reviews on Yelp, I decided to make an appointment with Kim. She is an amazing stylist with a wealth of knowledge and skills regarding color and hair care! I am so pleased my hair and I am most appreciative of the professional and friendly environment! This is a very difficult standard to achieve. Definitely returning to Kim!",positive
"This salon looks so small tucked in off of Perry Hwy. As I walked in, I was greeted by an adorable puppy basking in the sun. The decor and atmosphere made me feel like I was at a relaxing lounge. Especially, the complimentary wine and beer! I loved all the fresh plants, the set up and decor of the salon, such a relaxing atmosphere! I came in with a few pictures, but overall pretty open to ideas. My hair was honestly a mess and needed a lot of love! It was my first time with Jess and I was overly impressed! She did a fantastic job, I was actually looking at my hair today (a little over a week later) and it still looks fabulous. Highly recommended and truly feel like I've found my salon.",positive
"Copacetic... where shall I begin? It's a true rarity these days to find a person with talent that exudes so much passion for their art. So it's only fair that I share my experience with this salon. My stylist who I had went to for years had to start limiting her hours so needless to say we unfortunately had opposite schedules and I needed to find a new salon quickly! Immediately, following the break up my search for a hair queen started. Letting someone else touch my hair was very scary for me... Mostly because I'm blonde and all you other light haired girls out there know that blonde can turn to orange and/ or break off with a quickness if the stylist isn't knowledgeable. So I hopped on social media to see what I could find... after all pictures don't lie and I needed physical proof that my hair wasn't going to fall out! The pictures of her before and after's were on point and exceptionally beautiful. So of course I made an appointment. I HAVEN'T LOOKED BACK SINCE! I should add that I have an autoimmune disease which has caused me to lose a lot of hair so to say that my hair is thinning would be an understatement. Nikki James installs my hair extensions and does my color monthly and I'm grateful to have her in my life. I'm not ashamed to say that my hair was and still is a huge part of my life ... it's a shallow world we live in and I don't see that changing anytime soon. So that being said, when I started to lose my hair I lost a part of my identity which Nikki helped to restore. Thank you Copacetic for being a master of your craft and for cosmetically and psychologically transforming self-images.",positive
"What an amazing salon run by professional, talented, amazing women! I have been going to Missy for the past 14 years and am always pleased with what she does! Copacetic is a beautiful salon in a great location with a friendly, welcoming, and knowledgeable staff. What more could you ask for? :-)",positive
"Love love love! I can't say enough good things. Missy and Nikki have made a place where you feel at home. I'm so proud of these ladies and can't wait to see what great things are in their future. Missy and I have essentially grown up together. Whether I want a pixie with platinum streaks or long flowing locks, I always walk out looking like my mane belongs in a magazine. I'm so happy that these 2 and their staff have a place where we can all be friends and chat it up and have a fun and relaxing day.",positive
"LOVE Copacetic Beauty Lounge! I went to Nikki shortly after another stylist from a different salon turned my ashy blonde hair into a copper nightmare. I left CBL with the most beautiful color correction! Nikki really spent her time ensuring that my hair was processed correctly, and she sought input from fellow co-workers which I really liked, feeling as though I had a whole team of stylists on my side to make sure that locks came out perfectly for my style and taste. On top of the amazing service and staff, the salon itself is very welcoming and easy going, which had me thinking the whole time that everything sure is ""Copacetic.""",positive
I absolutely love getting my hair done here! Beautiful and calming environment with the funnest stylists who do killer work. I go to Nikki but know that all of the stylists equip their clients with hot looks. They pay extra attention to who you are and really make you feel like a valuable client. Wouldn't go anywhere else!,positive
"I would recommend Copacetic to anyone and everyone! All of the employees are so friendly and greet you with a smile. Nikki has been my stylist for years and she's fantastic! I never know what to do with my hair so I usually let her take the reins. I always leave the salon feeling fresh, fabulous, and beautiful! Copacetic is #1!",positive
"Missy has been doing my hair for years and this is the third place I have followed her to and probably final because she's a co-owner now:) I feel so strongly about the work they do that I gladly make the trek from the opposite side of town. It's so worth it. I continue to get the fantastic color work done in an amazing salon that truly is only there to make you look like your best self. I don't trust anyone else but Missy, though I have seen the talent they have procured for this new salon and I am impressed. I have to say I would feel comfortable with any of the staff--and I am super picky about color. The space is bright, open, relaxing, and they care very much about your experience there. Beverages, snacks, you name it, it's there for you to enjoy during your services. Everything about this salon is wonderful, from the staff to the amenities, you'll love it.",positive
"Whether you're looking for a traditional haircut and style or something more non-traditional, the stylists at this salon will delight you! I'm watching a lady go blonde on my left, a lady go black with gorgeous dark blue highlights on my right, and I'm going bright red. Behind me is a child getting her hair cut and a gentleman just exited with a new, very dapper looking haircut. Come check them out. Regardless of the style you're seeking, they can accomodate. (Except for maybe combovers...I don't know if they do those.) If you want to go red, see Missy. She's the best!",positive
"This salon is brand spanking new and located in Pines Plaza along Perry Highway. I came across Copacetic after hearing that my go-to stylist would be taking her talents here. I was able to book an appointment for their opening week and loved everything about my visit! The salon is beautifully decorated in a mix of modern and rustic pieces, with comfy chairs to wait in, beverages to help you pass the time (water, coffee, wine, beer), as well as an open industrial atmosphere. My stylist, Kim, proved why she's my favorite and one of the best in the biz - she gave me an amazing haircut and put my mind at ease before snipping and styling me into a fantastic shoulder-length cut. Their prices are great, the staff is excellent and refined at what they do, and the environment is clean, cool, and comfortable. If you're looking for a change of scenery or an excuse to check out a new salon, you'll be in great hands at Copacetic!",positive
"new location right across the street. It's better! .. my minus one star is to advise anyone who is special ordering anything from them- to go elsewhere. My salon kit took 4 months to come in and a simple paul Mitchell hairspray my client wanted- STILL hasn't came in (5 months ago!) I called and asked about it and they said if we haven't called you, it hasn't came in... so just go to another location for special orders.. or by the time you wait you'll find it elsewhere",positive
This was my favorite location but I just drove there the other day and they closed down :(. If they relocated in Glendale someone please let me know!,positive
"My go to spot for all my salon supply needs. Great prices, always great specials going on and if they don't have it, they'll order it for you!! These gals that work there are awesome and informative as well.",positive
I just moved to Arizona and I do hair for a living I am so glad that there's a Cosmoprof close to my house!!!! Omg even though this Cosmo prof is in a super dead center it doesn't matter they have everything I need.. Girls who work here are so super attentive they're so nice and very helpful with everything.,positive
Mary and the staff here are great willing to help answer any questions you might have. That is why I will drive 40 miles out of my way to this beauty supply store for the great customer service.,positive
Had great friendly service from Epsy today! Lots of great sales and ideas for clients Christmas gifts. Thanks Cosmoprof!,positive
"I absolutely love this location! I've even switched a few things I use from other beauty supplies to do the majority of my shopping here, the staff is always friendly and professional, and are very knowledgable, and I never have had any issues with returning or exchanging an item. I love shopping here.",positive
"Staff was super friendly and knowledgable. Easy to find and plenty of parking. Their selection was a little low as they were out of a few of the products we were looking for. Maybe it's because it was the holiday? Not sure, but if you're looking for something specific, I would suggest calling first.",positive
"I love this place. They always have what I need and they're so friendly and polite. They are only one of the places I go to for nail supplies, but I definitely enjoy coming here. Management is always knowledgable and if they DONT know something, they make sure they get you the answer ASAP",positive
"This is by far the very worst place to go for a haircut,I took my son back after we already had a horrible experience,when his dad brought him home last night after his visit with Jazzmon I was furious,I immediately tried to call a manger at the store and at 130 pm the next afternoon I'm still unable to reach a manager..My sons hair is so hacked he didn't go to school today..Come on ppl hire some real hair dressers,stop scraping at the bottom of the barrel for ur employees once the hair comes off it's not like u can glue it back on..",negative
My 5 year old daughter got her first hair cut for kindergarten. We wanted to donate her hair. After a friend searched forever for a place that could cut hair to the requirements we came across Cost Cuters. All the staff was super knowledgeable about the process and made everything go smoothly. Everyone was friendly and had the patience to work with little ones that constantly move during their hair cut. My daughter cut off 18 inches of hair and got an adorable long bob hair cut for her first day of school and wigs for kids got 18 inches of hair donation. Thanks to the staff for helping my daughters first hair cut memorable. If you are looking for a place to cut for hair donations I defitinely recommend this Cost Cutters for the cut process.,positive
"As I have just moved to Phoenix and haven't had time to scout out a hairstylist, when I needed a haircut for an upcoming trip I got on Yelp and located the nearest salon. I was a bit nervous about what I would get for $14.50, but it's just hair and mine grows back with the quickness. I called, made an appointment and a couple hours later I was in the chair. Now I for one am not good at giving direction. I know what I want, but articulating it can be a bit of a challenge so I just give some guidance and tell them to do what they think will look good... again, it's just hair. I did just that with Alexis and it was like she read my mind. She used a razor vs clippers, which I prefer, and she really got in there and went to work on the layers. She did an AMAZING job and I will definitely be back for upkeep.",positive
"I went today to get a haircut, however before going to this place. Of course I check the reviews. I seen many amazing reviews on Michelle! So I made sure to make an appointment with her. Let me just tell you how great she was. First off she took her time with my haircut which is a HUGE deal to me, she was also very friendly and we had good conversation. I am very picky with who touches my hair. Next time I get my hair colored in 4-5 weeks I'll be having Michelle do it for me:) if you want great service and someone who takes their time with your hair. Ask for Michelle:)",positive
I got my haircut from Michelle today! She took her time and concentrated on my hair the entire time. My hair is perfect and so much better than it was! I have never had anyone (even someone who costs $60) take that much time and really perfect my hair. I have not found one person who has been as good as my girl in Colorado and its been 4 years and Michelle is even better! I will go back all the time.,positive
"I never knew this place was right around the corner from me until I saw the reviews on Yelp! I made an appointment with Michelle to get my hair cut and highlighted. She was great! It took a couple hours to get my hair done, but it was worth it. She did an amazing job. I highly recommend her!",positive
I don't know why I never looked at this location before but thanks to the yelp reviews I decided to give it a try for a little trim. I was welcomed by Lindsay who took my information and I had a 20 minute wait but thankfully they have a lot of magazines :) Lindsay did a great job of listening to what I wanted. She took off exactly what I asked for and it looked a million times better than I had anticipated. The haircut and wash came out to be around $16 and that was the best haircut I've had in a long time that was cheaper than my normal $60 cut. I appreciate Lindsay and will definitely be back. I appreciate that she was OK with me being not so chatty but she was extremely friendly and chatty with the person before me. Sometimes I just want to zone out when somebody's playing with my hair :) Thank you :),positive
Michelle is an amazing amazing at her job. She can do whatever you want from the latest hair cuts and dye jobs to the traditional looks. I call a head to make sure she is open to do my cuts. The saying you get what you pay for is not unilateral with hair. I have gone to some of the 'higher' end places and been very disappointed with the finished product. It all about the stylist and this place has a gem of one.,positive
I used to go to a VERY expensive salon. It cost about $55 for a haircut. Now I go to Michelle at this Cost Cutters. She is amazing and at less than $15 for a haircut...well worth it! I have my hair double processed for color and what would have cost between $200 and 300 at the other place costs me around $80 here and I have very long hair! Michelle is very professional and extremely nice. I don't know if I would come to someone different but as long as she's here I will be a customer.,positive
"I saw this today on Dear Abby... This is how I feel when I get my hair cut at Cost Cutters. Take a minute to read it. DEAR ABBY: I feel that the longer you go to the same hairdresser, the more she takes you for granted. The service gets worse. When I have shared this opinion with some of her other clients, they agreed. The salon does not have a receptionist. Whoever is there just picks up the phone, whether the stylist is working on a customer or not. During my last haircut, which usually lasts about half an hour, she answered the phone six times. I pay for my appointment, and it should be at least relaxing. Have your readers had the same experience? -- MIKE IN NEW YORK DEAR MIKE: I'm sure some of them have, unless they told the stylist they're using they don't like being treated that way. So speak up. As a paying customer, it is your privilege.",negative
"I've been going to this Cost Cutters for close to two years. I was referred by a friend whose whole family has been going for years. I love the staff! So friendly, and so willing to help. Yes, they get busy, because they are so good. I always schedule ahead and never have a problem getting in. Highly recommend for cut and color!",positive
Have been having Lisa cut my hair She is great as she listens to me and is interested in what kind of style I'm looking for When I leave I'm always happy She has a personality that makes her customers feel so special Love her,positive
"Myself, my mom, and my sister all come here for our cuts and color and all the ladies here are fantastic! I have gotten my hair done by Lindsay and Michelle and they're so sweet, fun to talk to, and most importantly they are great with me hair! I just worked with Michelle before this review and she was gentle washing my hair, she was able to answer my questions about staying my bangs, and cut my hair exactly as I wanted! She recommended thickening shampoo and conditioner from Big Sexy Hair that works great and volumizes my hair. I've paid a lot of money at high ends salons and this place treats me the same and does just as good of a job for a much cheaper price. I highly recommend it!",positive
I always have a good time when I go to this shop! I've had almost all the girls cut my hair and they always do a great job!,positive
I was very unsatisfied with the service I received. They were rude and acted like it was killing them to simply cut my hair. I know I have long but seriously it's thin! I didn't have any coloring done and my hair naturally drys straight. I will never becoming back here. I asked the gentle men for just a half an inch he cut off three inches! I refuse to ever come back!!!!!!!!!!!! I can't believe the attitude he gave me after I told him I was not pleased with my hair cut!,negative
"I've been here before and I miss it so much!! I decided after having been buried by books, time consuming studying and perseverance to finish my education early that I need and require some tlc. I need Barbara and Markis!!!!! I can say I really love their services. They are amazing people!!! I highly recommend them!!!",positive
This is the best place I have ever been to. Without a doubt. My nails had been torn from a previous experience at a different salon and she took the time to explain what may have gone wrong at the previous salon and how she was going to fix it. I'm so blown away by the amazing customer service as well as my perfectly shaped and polished acrylics. I cannot wait to go back!,positive
"I love the ladies here! Ileana and Barbara were here when my friend and I came close to ""last call"". They were so friendly and quite the characters! I loved the fact that when we were came there was one other lady receiving a pedicure was a long time regular of this salon. It was a true gift to experience the interaction between these three. They made us both feel right at home and we ended up mumbling to each other ""I love them!!!"" At least a few times. Their personalities really sold them! If I didn't live in Seattle I would get a membership Right Now!!! And, to top of this amazing-ness off, they did GREAT work. Spectacular work. A perfectly dreamy salon, indeed.",positive
The entire team at Creating Magic Salon are Outstanding! I had a Ladies Night Mani/Pedi and it was EXCELLENT! We will definitely be back!!! Plus they have really cute jewelry!,positive
This is the go to place for nails. Gaylee has so much passion for her practice that it really shows in the creative designs and styles. She can deliver - make an appointment and you will be amazed. Awesome staff and many options for nails!!!,positive
DONT EVER GO TO THIS PLACE!! Gaylee cut up my cuticles so badly- she didn't even do the cuticles before she applied the gel polish. I was in pain - throbbing for weeks after going to her! Finally they healed up and now I found out that I have a bacterial infection from a nail salon. I'm telling you and warning you not to go here. The business owner's response BTW- is responding to a different client- My name is not Jenny and the dates she references are not accurate- I was there on a different date altogether. THIS TELLS ME THAT OTHER PEOPLE ARE EXPERIENCING THE SAME THING!!,negative
"I will never go anywhere else for my nails - I found this salon thanks to Yelp in a desperate search for a salon that would do acrylics on toes, I lost mine hiking and have been beyond self conscious since and hadn't gone to get a pedicure since because I was too embarrassed (they look gnarly while coming back). I spoke with Barbara when making my appointment and she was super sweet and said they'd take a look and see what they could do. Gaylee was my girl for my appointment and I have NEVER ever ever had someone be as personable and detail oriented doing a mani/pedi as this lovely girl. I can't say enough great things about her - all of my self consciousness went out the window as she did her thing and made my tootsies look like normal, any pain I had from my nails being weird she took care of like a nurse and when the polish I had picked was low, she went and grabbed a couple of colors to mix so I could have the one I had originally picked. I got a gel mani too and love it. Barbara was super sweet in person and joined in our conversation. The whole experience was beyond comfortable and I felt like i was just hanging out with friends - I also teared up on the way out because of how great/normal my toes looked. I'm forever grateful to these ladies and will be a lifelong customer.",positive
"Carol Kelly is hands down the most knowledgable and talented aesthetician I've ever gone too! I've been seeing her for years and my skin has never felt or looked better. She is honest about what products you need and never pushes anything on you. She has changed my skin to wear I don't wear foundation anymore. Hallelujah!!! I wear my sunscreen everyday and a very light powder. I constantly learn more about my skin. She also waxes me. She uses a wax with no strips. The wax hardens and she gently pulls it away. I always use to hate getting my brows done because I would breakout around then after and be red for days. Granted I have very sensitive skin but with carol all my red is gone by the next day! I ca also get my waxing and facial all done in one sitting which is awesome. I trust her 150% with anything she advises or tells me. May I also say that once says you are ready then you are going to die of happiness after getting a microdermabrasion. My skin literally glowed! It was baby bum smooth and everything. I'm telling you, if you want flawless skin then go to Carol Kelly. She is the sweetest!!",positive
"Stumbled upon this nail salon the other day and decided to try a manicure..decent priced and was very pleased with the ""over the top"" customer service!!! Very friendly environment!! I was extremely impressed with the cleanliness of the salon as Well which i feel is quite noteworthy..i would definitely go here again!!!",positive
"Love this salon so much! Very clean and everyone is super friendly. I think the prices are fair - you're paying for salon quality work with pros. I think they take walk ins but I usually call ahead. I've never had my hair done here but my mani pedis are always perfect. They don't use those cuticle clippers that can can cut you or those feet shaver things. Everything is sanitized and non-scary. I always get solid colors on my nails but someday I'll have to get some nail art, the pictures I've seen are so impressive!",positive
"I found the reviews on yelp so helpful when selecting this salon to get my nails done. I called yesterday morning for a gel mani and someone answered the phone right away and they scheduled me in for later that day. Ileana did my nails and she's great! Super friendly, very professional, and my nails look awesome :) I plan to come here often.",positive
I usually have trouble getting my nails done well because my nail beds are pretty small. Barbara did an awesome job on my very simple but beautiful acrylic overlays. The shop is beautiful and very clean. The staff was super courteous and friendly. I will definitely keep going back.,positive
New employee took two hours to give me a pedicure. Very awkward experience. She was clumsy and I left with a smudged big toe. Fifty dollar pedicure disaster. It felt like a pedicure from a beauty school. Bummed.,negative
I have been coming to Barb at Creating Magic for months for my pedicures and manicures. She is awesome and ok couldn't be happier. I then met Carol and started seeing her for my eyebrows and eyelashes. Wonderful wonderful. Love these women.,positive
"Two stars are for the friendly staff and cleanliness. I was very disappointed in the pedicure I received. $56.00 and an hour later I left with poorly polished toes, the dark color I came in with wasn't completely removed. My heals are still cracked, there was no dead skin removed. One of my favorite parts of my weekly pedicure is the massage and was disappointed in that too. Perhaps nails and hair are their thing and that's why they have many good reviews. Don't waste your money here for a pedicure.",negative
"My mother-in-law and I walked in 30 minutes before close, in desperate need of new nails for the MIL. I was also trying to treat my mother-i-l. before she flew out the next day after her Christmas vacation with us. We had stumbled on Creating Magic by googling, ""Nails,"" in the iphone map. Barbara, the owner, greeted us and she knew that this would go past their closing time, but she agreed anyways. Barbara was very personable and did ""the best job,"" my mother-in-law, who has been getting her nails done religiously for 20+ years, as ever done. I liked the ""small local business feel."" The owner and her other salon employees were joking around and were very hospitable to us late comers. I don't get my nails done much, or frequent salons, for that matter, but I would consider getting some waxing, nails or highlights, just to go back! Thank you Barbara and friends!",positive
"I went in for the first time today for a pedicure with a MasterCard gift card I got for Christmas. I found them on Yelp, I was with Marisa & she was so professional & nice. Let me just say, I am so happy I found them! I already made an appointment for 4 weeks out. It's my new spot :)",positive
"We had a canceled flight with time to kill... Mani/pedi and a blow out were just what we needed! Staff was super friendly, my nails looked great and with a short uber/taxi, made it back for or flight in no time:)",positive
"I love this place! I went in today for the first time, got a 20% off discount because it was my first time and I ended up having Kaitlyn! She was awesome, she's hand paints all her art from a pretty butterfly to Audrey Hepburn ! She's freakin' amazing! The atmosphere is nice, very energetic and friendly. I love love LOVE it its amazing! I hands down recommend it!!",positive
Found an amazing stylist at this salon! Markis is precise and detail oriented and you always leave the salon with incredible looking hair. The salon is so clean and the staff is friendly and very hospitable. Great atmosphere. Great service. So happy I found a new salon! Thank you Markis!,positive
I had the most pleasant experience this morning for my manicure. I had been here once before for a fill and I was definitely pleased the first time but this time exceeded all my past experiences at any nail salon. My nail tech Iliana was fantastic! My nails look sooooooo great! The owner is always smiling and I was surprised that she had remembered me just from my very first visit. I have never had a nail salon where I look forward to seeing the people as much as my finished product. Great overall experience. Very clean no gross chemical smells and wonderful people. LOVE LOVE LOVE this place.,positive
"For a superb nail tech, go see Kaitlyn @ Creating Magic. She has done mani/pedi for me several times & does outstanding nail art-extremely creative! She's friendly-as is everyone @ this lovely shop. Give her a try - you won't regret it=)",positive
"My daughters and I went to see Laine for hair cuts today. She is a super star artist with hair! Each of us has very different hair-one daughter has very long (past her waist), straight, very thick hair, the other has medium length, super fine, wavy hair that likes to tangle, and I have (now) short, thick half straight half wavy hair with sparkle (I mean gray). So lots of textures and lengths to work with and Laine scored a 10 with each one. I wish I knew how to post photos here.",positive
"Awesome! My wife and I could not believe how professional and hospitable Creating Magic was. Barbara did my pedicure (mind-blowing) and Gaylee did my wife's mani-pedi (which she can't stop talking about!). Their work is amazing! But my favorite part of our experience here was that we has fun! It felt like we've come here all of our lives, and we were the oldest of friends. The whole staff truly have a connection that just reels you in with their teamwork and genuine affection toward one another. The lemon scrub with the Shea butter finish turned me into a whole new person. I sworn I could've done ballet after my pedicure, because my feet were on clouds when Barbara got through with my feet using those magic wands she calls hands. Yes, I said magic wands, because she did magic on me and turned my feet into butter! And don't get me started on Gaylee! My wife's nails and toes were done so perfect, you would think that it was a team of engineers who did them. But believe me, it was one person! I can't put in words how to describe the color and design of my wife's toenails. But my wife calls it luscious purple color highlight sparkle (she always splays her arms while saying it). Lol. Sounds amazing right?! That cause it is that amazing! The French tip Gaylee did on wife's hands were like none I've ever seen before. It's a smooth shade of white I have never seen before. I never even knew white had different shades until then. By the time we were done. We were sad to go. But, we were happy that my wife and I had found OUR fortress of solitude in Phoenix!",positive
"I was extremely pleased with my entire experience at Creating Magic. The entire staff was very friendly, and I was seen by my nail tech, Gaylee, promptly at my appointment time (they accept walk-ins, but I didn't want to take chances on a Saturday afternoon). I opted for the Creating Magic Pedicure (as my feet were in rough shape), and it was heavenly. I chose this pedicure because it incorporated everything I was looking for - dry file, foot soak, nail shaping, cuticle treamtment, callus remover, scrub, lotion, massage, and polish. I wanted a 'package' that would include these treatments, rather than having to do a bunch of add-ons. Gaylee did an excellent job with my calluses. She took off quite a bit but didn't leave them tender. The foot and leg massage were fabulous. Gaylee has a great attention to detail, and my feet are now ready for summer here in Phoenix. We also had a pleasant conversation during my pedicure, and I really enjoyed my experience here. The salon itself is bright and clean, and all of the staff are friendly and professional. They have everything that you want and nothing that you don't. I would highly recommend Creating Magic, and I plan on coming back soon!",positive
"AMAZING experience! I loved the atmosphere in the salon and everyone was so friendly! I felt as though it was filled with my family! Barbara, the owner, is so hospitable and professional! Ileana was the person who took care of me for my mani/pedi! Amazing work and very professional! Everything was so CLEAN!",positive
"Colleen is wonderful, attentive, approachable and honest. I searched a lot of reviews of different nail salons and made my choice based on them. Not only is the salon easy to find. It's super duper clean. I am going back! This place is worth the drive and no gimmicks here either. I love love love my pedi and mani. Have a great time choosing this salon.",positive
"I love this place!!!! I would not go anywhere else!!!! They are very clean, its bright and sunny in the salon and my nails always look fantastic.",positive
"I really enjoyed my mani/pedi today with Barbara. She is a very genuine person and I enjoyed the feel of the salon. The salon is still in the growth stage, but you can tell they take care of their customers and they are more about quality versus quantity. I will definitely return. Nice nails and nice people.",positive
This new salon is a gem. Super clean and very friendly staff. They are a full service nail salon with massage services. And best of all...I got 50% off my services as a new walk in client! My pedicure was awesome and I love my new acrylic nails. One of the best salon experiences I've had in a long time.,positive
"Autumn was the BEST! She worked on my roots and she took the best care of my hair. No more gray! Luv, luv her. I completely connected with her. See you soon Autumn!",negative
"This was the best service I've had since I've moved to Las vegas! My hair looked so amazing, it was shiney and styled so nicely. i didn't have to do my hair for 3 days after! I'm the only one, till now, who took the time to blow dry and style my hair correctly. Autum is friendly, quick, knowledgeable and easy to talk to. I'll be telling my friends all about her. Thanks Autum!",positive
Had Autumn do a color and cut on my hair last week. Great job and fast. She is the best. Watch out you other LV cutters and colorists... you have some real competition here!,positive
"Autumn is a great stylist and person, really makes you feel special and love my hair color so happy to have found her on groupon",positive
"Autumn has amazing knowledge with hair color and extensions! She is completely professional and educated in her skills with color, cut, highlights, & extensions. She is also certified in eyelash extensions in which are unique and incredibly beautiful!",positive
I was very impressed with my haircut. I came in on a rainy Saturday so there was no lineup. Everyone says it's the best haircut that I have had in years! The establishment is clean and bright. The only caveat is bring cash. I had to use the atm next door as they only take cash. Pricing is reasonable and starts at $21 for a mens basic cut which is what I paid for my undercut with part and fade. I am extremely happy and I will be back!,positive
"To the ladies: My husband Jack had his hair cut by Abe a month ago and said it was the best haircut he has ever received. I agree! Abe is professional, friendly and economical ( which is the icing on the cake!) . We HIGHLY recommend Abe for any man who cares about looking the best he can be. I just got off the phone with Abe to make an appointment for my husband before he returns to Toronto tomorrow and Abe treated me like family. We cannot say enough about Abe, all we can say is tell your husband, sons and every male you know in Calgary that this is hands down the best haircut in Calgary. Period. Toronto has nothing on Abe. See you in Sept when we are back in town Abe !",positive
"I'm new to Calgary and was looking for a barbershop. I went here and had a haircut with the 2nd barber and was not overly impressed. I gave the barber specific instructions to not take too much hair off a certain area of my head and to leave the other area shorter. He basically shaved the area that I asked to keep longer (in other words did the exact opposite of what I requested) and now it looks completely uneven. Not a bad environment and they were friendly enough though. At the end of the day it's just hair and it will grow back, but I'm going to have to let that hair grow out awhile and will likely go somewhere else next time.",negative
"These guys are fast, accurate and charge a fair price. My son got a haircut there today. The barber was very gentle and kind to my son, all the way home my son kept saying ""dad that's my new forever barber"". He's happy and I am happy, we will definitely be back.",positive
"Just got an amazing Fade from Abe, I can tell you this guy is a magician he knows how to work your hair and has an amazing talent I'm from California and I can tell you that Abe impressed me more than any barber I have been to down there! Definitely recommend checking them out if you haven't already they know what they're doing and their prices are very good",positive
"My son only wants to go there for haircuts! The guys that run the place are friendly and courteous. It is cash only, so be sure to remember that!",positive
"I don't send my kids anywhere for a haircut except Dalhousie barbershop. The barbers r amazing with kids, very funny, and the cuts are immaculate. Would recommend for anyone wanting a great haircut at a super great price!",positive
My husband has got curly hair so not every barber is able to get his hair right but here they gave him a great haircut within minutes. The staff were extremely friendly and welcoming too.,positive
"Despite some recent staff turnover and a small price increase (now $19 for a regular haircut, $17 for a buzz cut, cash only), this place keeps me coming back for a simple reason: it's as straightforward as it gets. You walk in (no reservations), you wait your turn if all three chairs are occupied, and then you get your haircut the way you like it.",positive
"No frills, just a good haircut for a low price. It's my new favourite spot after getting tired of paying a lot more for trendier places.",positive
"My hair is important but not so much that i worry about it. If I get a bad haircut, no big deal. It always grows back. That's why I go to chain barbers. And I found a decent one. Then....a buddy of mine recommended Dapper Dan's. It is the best haircut I've had in ages. His lines are super clean, my cut is even throughout, without a bunch of stray hairs or loppy cuts. Something i regularly put up with at any one of the other places I was going to. Dan's studio is a one person affair. That's why he can spend so much time giving you a great cut and style. He's trained and worked all over the place, so he has substantial experience with all hair textures, he can cut an expert flat top, shave skin fades, and do both old school and modern hair cuts. If you've ever had a flat top, you know it's not as simple as it seems. The 100 year old barber chair and his careful attention to detail make the experience all the more worthwhile. It's great that he takes appointments only, eliminating the need to walk in and wait 30 minutes like other places. He also does straight razor shaves. His hand is gently and he uses plenty of hot and cold towels and ointments to leave your skin feeling smooth and refreshed. The best cut you can get. And all this for a supremely reasonable price!",positive
"Dapper Dan is the best in the business! He pays attention to detail, and I highly recommend getting your haircut there. I live on the other side the valley, but make the drive to old town because of his work.",positive
Really appreciate the online booking and the fact that Dan sticks to the schedule. Didn't have to wait when it was my turn. Great haircut with obvious attention to detail.,positive
I've been looking for an amazing barber in the Scottsdale area for a while now and I'm glad I came across Dan. He's a super cool guy and knows what he is talking about. He takes pride in the work that he does and won't finish until you and him are both satisfied with the job that was done. Definitely gonna be my go to guy from here on out and I would recommend anyone I know to get their hair done by Dan.,positive
Great job. He was so thorough and took time to make sure all was perfect. Got a cut and a shave and the shave was a great experience with a warm towel to start. The whole treatment was superb,positive
Loved the online appointment booking and text message confirmation/reminders. Great haircut and beard trim! Dan was friendly and chatty without being overly so. Sometimes just some quiet is good. :) I spend a few months in PHX area every winter and I've finally found a place to get a great haircut when I'm there.,positive
"I have been going to Dan for about 2 years, and he gives a good haircut, which is the only reason this review isn't one star. The reason why I give him two stars is that he does not know how to run a business or treat his clients. Over the course of 2 years I've had about 30-40 appointments with him total, never missing or being late to one. In addition, I was one of his first clients when he left his previous barber shop, sticking with him as he started his new business. I recommended him to every guy I know and have sent multiple clients to him that are now regular customers. Last week, for the first time, I missed an appointment because of a matter that came up. Rather than give me the courtesy of a call or text, Dan decided to inform me that I would be charged extra on my next visit. He treated me like just another valueless customer who misses appointments left and right (piece of advice for Dan, a client who misses one appointment out of 40 is still a great client). Additionally, he used a derogatory racial slur when referencing me to another client, who then told me. I will not be going to Dan again. Dan does not know how to respect, treat, or value his clients, or how to run a business. If you want a quick haircut, he's a good choice, but if you want a barber to go to regularly, stay away.",negative
"One fear of moving to a new state is finding the right barber. Well, this is the first place I went to after moving to the area and let me tell you this place is top notch. Dapper Dan is the man. He really goes into detail about your cut. He takes his time and is careful with your cut. Great conversation also. I highly recommend going here for your next cut. Will be back soon!",positive
"Made an appointment with dapper dan for 10:20 am on Saturday February 4th. To respect the appointment and the ""master barber's"" time I arrived at 10:15am for the appointment. The quote on quote master barber had someone sitting in the chair when I arrived. I waited until 10:30 in the lobby and then left. As a consumer I will not reward a business who cannot keep an appointment with my time and money. Thanks ""dapper dan"" I guess I will go to cut throat barber shop.",negative
Found Dapper Dan after doing some research and since then he's moved to his own personal spot. Dapper Dan makes my man look good. He specializes in men's haircuts and also does beard trimming. My boyfriend loves the hot towel treatment on his beard and consistency in polished cuts. Dapper Dan has a small private suite within a collection of other stylists. He offers a man escape zone (so ladies- stay home). My boyfriend is really thankful I found Dapper Dan!,positive
"I've been getting my haircut by Dapper Dan for a few months now and I feel like I've struck gold. The guy definitely knows what he is doing. Very professional, consistent, and takes pride in his work. If you go to Dapper Dan you won't be disappointed.",positive
"Dan is the truth. I have a hard time finding someone who can actually cut my hair to a style that I like, and from the first time I saw Dan he was able to do that for me. Probably the best fade/cut that I've ever gotten and the service is top notch. I've now recommended him to multiple friends of mine who are now regular clients. Dan's cuts were so impressive that I now come in for a cut/shave combo and leave happy every time. If you're in Scottsdale or anywhere near and are looking for that old school treatment without all the extra fuss I definitely recommend you make an appointment ASAP.",positive
"Recent transplant from Boston, so the cut is important. No bullsh*t Dan is strait money team. Tried Cutthroat but their ""online"" booking is jankey. Hands down guy is the King of Cuts in the Southwest....Think I'm f*ckin with you; just know he was the top guy at Cutthroat...ask him...he's doing better...boom success. Bottom line guy is legit and brings the heat!",positive
"Coming from a person who's very picky about cuts, I can't emphasize enough the quality of Dan's work. He puts the extra effort most barbers don't put in, and he genuinely cares about his clients experience. From the classic cut to the straight edge shave, this guy is about as consistent as they come. If you're lookin for a professional cut, he's the man to see!!",positive
"I have been seeing Dan for a few months now getting my hair cut. Let me just start by saying he gives the best cut I have gotten in the area. On top of that, he goes out of his way to make you relaxed while you get your haircut, comfortable, good shave, all that you need after a long days work. I would recommend Dan any day to all of my friends, and will continue coming back here.",positive
"What can I say about Dapper Dan? Well I'm very picky and particular with my haircuts. I'm also very loyal once I find someone I like. I've only changed barbers/stylists a couple times and always after I or they moved. All that said I can whole heartedly say that Dapper Dan is one of the best! He has an eye for detail that you should expect in a barber and while he is very quick with his skills you know he's never rushing. Throw in a quiet environment to relax in, a hot towel treatment and old school vibrating shoulder massage and you really can't go wrong. So make an appointment, drop in and enjoy a great cut and maybe a cold one!",positive
I been going to Dapper Dan for months am glad I found this place he knows how to make it happen ! need a cut book you're appointment !! With Dapper Dan !,positive
Best cuts for sure with Dan. He is great at whatever style you're rockin' and listens to what you want. Dan takes the time to triple check your cut and you leave feeling fresh. Highly recommend booking a haircut with him.,positive
Dapper Dan was fantastic. I was traveling for work and was unable to go to my usual barber in SoCal. I found Dan and was immensely impressed. You won't be disappointed.,positive
"Dapper Dan is amazing! He's not afraid to spend time to make sure your cut looks perfect. Most other barbers try and get you in and out but DD truly cares about his work. I have sent several of my colleagues and friends to him and they all report the same and thank me for the referral. Solid work Dapper Dan, as a customer I truly appreciate how you handle us as people and not just a number!",positive
"Dapper Dan is for real. I was looking for a good barber since moving back to town but having little luck. I noticed one of my pals here recently had some really slick haircuts so I asked him who he's been going to and he delivered. Online appointment system was as easy as could be, I felt welcomed and comfortable from the moment I walked in. Everyone there seemed chill and Dan was really personable. Most importantly, the cut was probably the best haircut I've ever had. He really takes his time and does a superb job, providing you with the cut you came in for. Have no fear, this is the guy you're looking for.",positive
"Dapper Dan is the Man!!! I've searched for a long time for someone with his style and ability! I drive 2 hours one way every month just to get the best haircut of my life! If you're reading this, you're obviously looking for a great barber. Do yourself a favor and STOP LOOKING! Go find Dan and get a haircut! You're a mess!",positive
"Dapper Dan does a great job on my haircut, love the convenience of making an appointment and getting a quality cut, I usually get a taper and he's fantastic at them!",positive
"This guy is top notch, does nothing but the highest quality of work every time. Any type of cut he's got you covered. You won't be disappointed.",positive
Dan has been taking care of me for a while now. Honestly I don't know why people would go anywhere else. The time he takes which each cut is extremely professional and refreshing. He is truly dedicated to getting every detail right and to exactly what you want. I would come here even if I lived an hour away. Highly recommended.,positive
"Dapper Dan does a great job. You can tell he takes pride in his work, and his craft, and is looking to provide a great, professional cut. Got a great haircut. I would definitely recommend Dapper Dan to anybody.",positive
"I've been seeing Dapper Dan for about 7 months now on a weekly basis. The man always makes sure my hair looks great and goes above and beyond on his tips and details of the cut. If you're looking for a fresh cut and consistency, he's the man!",positive
"Dapper Dan is great. He has a good feel for the characteristics of hair and how it behaves when cut different ways. Easy to talk to when discussing what you want. Pays very close attention to detail to make sure the cut is of high quality. As mentioned in other reviews, quality of cut is very consistent.",positive
By far the cleanest and freshest cut I've ever received! A meticulous barber who pays attention to detail! Dapper Dan is the guy to see! You won't be disappointed!,positive
Dapper Dan gives a serious hair cut. Capable of anything!!! I won't go any where else. He pays attention to detail and knows exactly what he's doing. Do yourself a favor and go to Dapper Dan he is the man!!!,positive
"Esha is so sweet and quick, got my lashes done for the first time, mine you I have the most sensitive skin, eyes, and it came out beautiful. Definitely recommend for eyelash service",positive
"Milly, the threading tech at this place brought my eyebrows back to life!! I have been getting my eyebrows threaded for years now and there has been many occasions where they leave my eyebrows completely botched. I recommend this place. It is far, but definitely worth the drive!",positive
The service here at the charleston location was amazing. Had my lashes done for the first time and extremely happy with the my new lashes!!! Also had my eyebrows threaded Esha did a remarkable job!!! Highly recommend this place!!!,positive
"ive been getting my full face threaded for almost 5 years. ive recently moved here to vegas and needed a new place. Esha was fantastic. she was kind and welcoming. she was light handed and quick. AND she naturally went to clean up my nose. in all these years, ive always had to request this from others (except the girl who first offered it to me). there were no strong smells in the location. it was a small clean location. take the stairs on either side of the building or the elevator on the far right.",positive
"I would suggest from my experience do not waste your money here, I bought a Groupon at this place then called to schedule the appointment. They said the stylist doesn't work there they are only rent out each stall separately the receptionist didn't even know the name of the stylist. It seemed like a real scam I would not spend my money at this place. I told the lady it has their name and addresses on it and she said it doesn't matter, go get your money back. They really did not seem to care. Awful customer service, definitely not the kind of place I am looking for in a business.",negative
"Awesome service, really like eyebrows and threading technique. Pleasant environment best place in town. Eyebrows tinting, henna tattoos,etc",positive
"This is the only place where I get my eyebrows done, always get them threaded and tinted and they always look amazing. Esha and her daughter they both make a great job!",positive
I am very disappointed with the lash extensions I got from Esha at this Deep Beauty Spa location. The next day they all fell out. What?! She said they would last for weeks. But they didn't even last 24 hours. Maybe the glue is bad? I wish I didn't waste my time and money there. I tried calling but she never picks up the phone. It always goes to voicemail. I suggest you stay away from this place.,negative
Amazing service and amazing location!! I visit their other locations to but this is my go to place to get my eyebrows in place. Absolutely amazing customer service!!!!,positive
Very helpful and friendly and would highly recommend this place! She reshaped my eyebrows and gave me instructions on how to care for them.,positive
I was only going to get to get my eyebrows threaded but I saw that the eyebrows tinting was only $25 and I wanted to try it out. She told me to go black but I got scared that it will be too dark so I got dark brown instead. It looks really natural and she did it perfectly according to the shape of my eyebrows and face. Very happy with the result. Will definitely come back!!! :),positive
"Moved to Vegas from CA a couple months back and my eyebrows had been crazy since, definitely missing my girl in CA. Out of desperation I found Esha on Yelp and she didn't disappoint, she even managed to keep my pathetic arches visible. Super sweet and quick, very happy with the outcome.",positive
"This eyebrow threading experience was excellent. It was comfortable, quick, thorough and very pleasant. The only downside is that I can only use the ""$7 for $15 of service"" deal once but such is the world of business and profitability. Overall a great experience at a service provider that I will use again.",positive
"I redeemed a Yelp deal here last minute and glad I did! This eyebrow bar is located in a large complex, however the room Esha, the artist, rents the space is comfortable and cute. I had eyebrow threading and tint done. Naturally, I have thin and light eyebrows...I felt by the time she was done they were the opposite! Improved! She did not over pluck and managed to define a better shape. She used a black tint on my brows. When she was done the color came out looking natural. I recommend this place and plan to return for both threading and tint! I may even try the henna tattoos, as she does them there as well!",positive
"Used the yelp deal, and I am so happy that I found this place. The owner is very efficient and knows what she is doing. Will definitely go back.",positive
I found this place on Yelp I've been looking for years for a place that will do eyebrow tint. This place Is amazing and customer service is great. I would recommend this place to everyone from now on.,positive
I found this place from yelp. I called the number that is listed here and I initially thought they were no longer in business because it was just a generic cell phone voicemail but she called me back about 30 minutes later. She did say that she takes walk-ins until 5:00 pm and after that is by appointment only so that's something to keep in mind. Esha did a fantastic job on my out of control brows. It seems like the tread she uses is a thinner gage that what I've had used on me in the past but I barely felt it while she was doing it plus it didn't look like I got punched in the eye after she was done. Looks like I found my new eyebrow girl.,positive
Looking for a eyebrow threading place well look no further! I decided to give this place a try and I've never been happier! Esha is so professional and knows how to thread. This place is so clean and very cute. I'm so happy I never have to go anywhere else.,positive
"This is the best eyebrow threading in Las Vegas. I have been to a couple of places because I prefer threading over waxing, but what made me crazy is I felt like there wasn't any privacy. If you go to this location, you will probably see Esha, she owns the business and does the threading. You will walk into a private room where you can have whatever part of your face threaded without an audience. Esha also gets every little bit of hair. She really cares and she knows what she is doing. She even gave me a bottle of the lovely rose water she sprays on your face after a session. I am a regular here and I love it!",positive
I have always had my eyebrows waxed but Esha has got me hooked on eyebrow threading. I never knew my eyebrows could look this good. She reshaped my eyebrows and now I just go in to get them cleaned up every couple of weeks. I love that with threading even the little baby hairs around my brows and lips are gone and my makeup lays so much better. The price is very affordable and I've never had a hard time getting in to see Esha.,positive
Definitely the place to go for your threading needs. My wife went in for a session. The owner was not only very welcoming but very knowledgeable about what she was doing. She also gave her a 15% discount as a first time customer. Would definitely recommend this place if you are looking for an affordable yet professional threading place. Give this place a try.,positive
"Checked this place out since my girlfriend said my eyebrows looked like caterpillars, so I decided to try threading. I was very happy with the service and quality of work. It's located on the second floor of the complex and is quite, private and comfortable! If you have never tried threading, I suggest you do! The rose water at the end is a pleasant relief, which apparently she sells here as well.",positive
Love the girls they do a awesome job . they take their time to make sure you leave with awesome eyebrows .will be back .,positive
I been to this place many times and love what theyve done to my brows. See you in two weeks again to get maintenance done.:),positive
"I love Maggi! She's creative, patient, and just really fun to work with--always up for trying out something new and helping her client find that perfect personal style. The whole team at Details is great, they make it a pleasure to visit the salon and I always look forward to my appointments.",positive
"It's always so scary going to a new salon for a new stylist to do my hair for the first time. Am I right?! However, I found my new salon. Praise God! Kelly L did such a great job and was so cute & helpful. She knew exactly what I wanted and executed it beautifully. Highlights, lowlights and a cut. It turned out exactly the way I imagined and maybe even a little better. Happy to have a new go to gal! Aveda over everything.",positive
"I love the comfortable vibe of this salon! It's clean, fresh and charming and I always feel welcome there. I have been going to Maggi for years and she's truly amazing. She is always in tune with the trends and knows how to transform my hair through both cut and color. She exceeds my expectations every time!",positive
"I love this place. Cool vibe, comfortable. I see Wilson for haircuts. I love how she cuts layers and she is so fun to be around. I previously went to her at another salon and followed her to Details. Yeah, she's that good. Aveda products...check. They have a great price of $35 for gel manicures which is solid.",positive
"If you're a guy, don't go here unless you want a short cookie cutter cut. Best cuts could have done the exact cut for 9 bucks. No attention to detail. When I said it was looking a bit off, the stylist told me "" I am not done yet"" should of left than. Receptionist offered a re- cut, however my hair was cut so short it couldn't be cut anymore. If you want trendy or fun don't go! Crazy mullets is way better",negative
"Fantastic haircuts! My wife and I both go here. We are both 30 yrs old and are both pretty picky about our haircuts. We both took a chance here after having bad haircuts from several places on the west side of Cleveland. We have been very happy every time we have walked out of here with the quality we have gotten. Not to mention the service here is A+. All of this is mixed with a good value. If you even somewhat care about your haircuts, this is the place for you.",positive
I'm so done with this salon. I guess my great run is done. I loved coming in. The atmosphere was always wonderful but my last two experiences have completely turned me off and I won't be returning. I got burnt on the side of my face and even the next time I tried a new stylist I booked the appointment at the beginning of the week only to get a text at 7:30 am the day of when my appointments at 9 from the stylist saying that she wasn't in town after all my confirmation emails and text. I am beyond disappointed because making arrangements before work and being up and ready was a waste of my precious time. Officially my last attempt to give anyone at this place a chance.,negative
"Beautiful and relaxing decor. My stylist Sha'kai was very professional and friendly, felt like I knew her before. A must return",positive
"If I could give -1 star I would. My first and last time at this salon. I made an appointment to have a touch up done to my roots. Kenya answered the phone when I called and she was very professional answering my questions. That was the only thing professional about my experience with this salon. When I arrived there was no one at the reception to greet meet and I had to wait a little bit until someone turned around to come to the front desk. Keisha came and told me the appointment was with her. She gave me two forms to complete, one of which basically asked you to sign away your life and any liability for any damage the hairdressers may do to your hair. Major red flag! No salon that's worth their reputation would have you sign a disclaimer form absolving their hairdressers from any liability. Clearly they have had issues in the past to have this as a policy. I asked to see the color product she would be using. For some reason after I asked to see the product she would be using she seemed like she did not like me asking this (as she went to get the product showed it to me and then turned around and walked away without a word, which was rude). I had questions regarding the price I was quoted and asked the owner (who seemed nice), but her explanations for a la carte pricing seemed not only outrageous but down right ridiculous, $95 for only a touch up to my roots! ($60 color service, $25 shampoo/conditioner, $10 for color product). She indicated because I was getting only the color (roots touch up mind you) with no styling this would be the cost. Not even in NYC would an upscale salon charge this much. I was on time for my appointment, however I waited for 30 minutes got up and walked out (and she still was blow drying another client's hair). The funny thing is they have a late policy for their customers with a grace period of 15 minutes after which they will start charging by the minute for your tardiness and add that amount to your bill or next service. Certain types of salons have no respect for your time and a simple service that should take an hour or so may end up taking half your day and costing you an arm and a leg. I felt the ""you are going to sit here all afternoon vibe"" and will never allow for that foolishness. I was very lucky to leave when I did as Keisha's lack of professionalism was a telltale sign of what could've turned out to be an awful experience. Thank you Father God!",negative
"I give this salon a -5. Let me first start by saying the owner Lamonica Cuthberson is the most ill mannered individual to deal with. I went to have my hair done on a Saturday morning at 10:30 am to have my hair colored rose gold ( my current color was plum brown) not only was I in this god forsaken salon for 8 hrs I walked out with my hair the same color just slightly and I mean SLIGHLY lighter. When I called the person who did my hair she mentioned she spoke to the owner and told her I did not look satisfied when I left . I asked for a refund for the color I was told to call the next day in the am to speak to the owner. When I called I spoke to some more rude ignorant staff members and was told she was not there. Long story short I was denied my simple refund for the color. They charged me $190 dollars for nothing. I would not recommend this salon to a pet rabbit. They are overpriced, slow and do not really know what they are doing in there. Customer service is -1000000. WORSE SALON EXPERIENCE I HAVE EVER HAD!!!!",negative
"Meh. I was referred by a close friend who knew the stylist really well. At the time, I had natural hair (it wasn't chemically treated) and I asked for a particular style. By the time she was done, the other stylists were looking and trying to say something nice to me. When I finally took a look at my hair, I just SMH and ask the stylist to REDO MY HAIR, rinse it out and let's start over. My hair was crunchy, and I had to stay in the salon an extra HOUR so she could fix the mess. Terrible experience...",negative
"I recently relocated to Charlotte and was in need of a natural hair stylist... After reading the 40+ positive reviews on Google, I ventured to this salon in Jan. 2016 where I was serviced by Ashley (a new-comer as well). I have been a regular customer ever since for regular hair maintenance - twists, protein treatments, trims, straightening, highlights - and LOVE the flexibility that the salon offers in booking appointments online and their wi-fi access. I've truly enjoyed the service that I've received from Ashley and always receive compliments on my hair from strangers in public. I sometimes have an idea of what I want, and then Ashley is able to expand it to something more. Most importantly, my hair is without damage and continues to flourish under Ashley's care, despite my lazy maintenance regime in between.",positive
"I love this place! If you are looking for friendly staff, great environment and a clean salon this is the place for you. I have been going for a year now and it's great!",positive
"Here I am in charlotte college student looking for a natural hair salon. I finally settle on this place because my hair needed attention. I come in on Saturday, nice atmosphere and lighting . I ask about the natural hair services and decided to get an updo. I make the appointment for 2pm the next day. My advice don't come any earlier because I came at 1:30, saw the open sign lit up but the doors were locked until exactly 2pm. I come in meet the stylist. She ""consulted"" my hair. Not really telling me any useful information. I told her the style I wanted and she seemed to try and coax me into a blow out . Which I was trying to steer away from due to heat damage, she then detangled my hair while it was Dry . Washed it and blow dried it . . Not sure if that's right but anyway the final result was satisfactory. Maybe next time I will try a specific natural salon",negative
"LaMonica can straighten hair well. However, she is not the best at blowing and neither are her employees. After having my hair blow dried my ends were broken off. My ends were not previously split bc I'd recently had them trimmed. I tried to talk to the owner about the issue but she defended the stylist poor techniques. I've known others to go this salon and not be pleased by the outcome. I will not return.",negative
"Dislike, Closing the doors with no notice! Bad Form. Will follow my stylist, not this bankrupt company.. My 16 year old daughter was there when they notified the Arrowhead staff. The Staff was in tears, unbelief, etc. As can be understood-notified 5 days before the doors closed. This company is unprofessional and desperate. Won't be back EVER- to any location.. Get a new accountant- some class.. And Good luck..",negative
"I had been getting my hair done here every 6 weeks for the last few years. They refused my appointment today because I had my three week old with me. Since hiring a baby sitter for my exclusively breast fed newborn isn't an option, I'll have to seek another salon to give my business to.",negative
I love this location! From the moment you walk you feel spoiled. Every little detail in decor is feminine and luxurious! The staff is warm and friendly and if you should have an issue with anything they are quick to fix it. I can be difficult a difficult client when it comes to my hair and to waxing and they always listen to my concerns and do the best to accommodate me. The relaxation area upstairs is amazing and I melt up there. The chocolate pedicures are too die for! I'm a dolce addict and will be back every chance I get! The experience is well worth the price.,positive
"I was given a 90 min customized organic facial by my MIL for mothers day. Shelley my facialist did amazing & was very sweet. She did not try to sell me product (like a lot of places do) actually said my skin looked great & was happy I wear sunscreen everyday. I would give her 6 stars if I could. The cashier/receptionist upon leaving is the reason I gave 4. No personality & never asked if I enjoyed my facial, or anything. Just ""do you want to leave tip"" uhh okay. Of course I did leave Shelley 30%, which I hope she doesn't have to share. Even tho it was a gift, that brought me in. if I can book with Shelley again, I will be back.",positive
"I went to dolce a couple years back and saw Gab. At this time she was in training. When I came in I told the receptionist(who was very polite) that I had an appointment with Gab, she went and got her right away. I waited less then five minutes for Gab to come and take me back. The place wasn't busy people getting their haircuts but it was also at 4pm. She took me back to her booth and asked my what I wanted done. I told her that I wanted some layers in my hair and my extensions(which I had brought my own) to blend in with my hair. (I had previously had my friends mom cut my hair which was a mistake) She washed my hair then took my back to her station. As she did my hair she talked to me and made me feel as if I was just one of her friends. She told me what she was doing as she did it and asked if it was okay to cut length off my extensions as well. She told me how she put the extension in my hair as well, which were clip in. When she finished cutting my hair she showed me how she styled her hair and it was simple and cute. I had mentioned how all the products she used smelled so good and she showed me what they were and what they were used for. She spent about 2 hours with me(granted this was on her day off she came in to do my hair). I was definitely satisfied with the cut and the experience with Gab! She gave me a paper that had recommended products on it so I definitely didn't feel like she was trying to make me buy all these hair products. While I was there I decided to get some waxing done which was my eyebrows, chin, and upper lip. For the price I was not impressed. The receptionist took me back and the waiting room was beautiful. I waited probably a good twenty minutes to a half hour for the lady to bring me back. The waxing took about 15 minutes and she didn't trying making small talk which was nice. For how expensive it was I didn't think it lasted long enough. All in all I would definitely go back and see Gab, it was quite expensive so I haven't been able to go back since. I have gone to my mothers hairstylist which does not do nearly as good as a job like Gab does. She is definitely worth the price to go see! I really want to try out getting my nails done here. However, I would never recommends getting waving done here.",positive
"While I can't say I have ever had a horrible experience here, I do think that the atmosphere is pretty pretentious and the services are extremely overpriced. The massage I got there was good, but the manicure, pedicure, and hair treatment I got were just mediocre at best. I realize they charge more for the sake of the one stop shop convenience, but I personally think it is worth it to go to different locations for nail, massage, and hair services.",negative
"I love Dolce and have been a client at the Borgata for years. I always plan ahead and stock up on Hunies when they are buy $100.00 get $200.00 in Hunies. Hadley gives the most amazing facials. I really appreciate the complimentary blowouts offered after massages and facials. I can not wait for the Scottsdale Quarter location to open! Hoping some of my ""girls"" will work there one or two days a week.",positive
"Pretty, Pretty Princesses apply here. The salon is very fancy and pretty. It is almost disgustingly so with hanging chandeliers, Water Fall walls, and a pretty rustic, curving rail stairs. The boutique is pretty. ( I got a killer necklace pretty cheap) The relaxing room and hallways, locker room are all pretty darn nice looking. I would never in a million years think to go here but I received a coupon for a massage for participating in Pat's Run. I was long overdue for a massage and did not want to wait to go to the massage school I usually frequent. I indulged, even with the coupon the price was a bit higher than I can afford on a teacher's salary. The location is not very convenient for me either. What the heck, I work hard. A gal can splurge every now and again. I had no problems booking the same day appointment. It is strange that you actually do not get the location you want when you call. You get the Chandler location but that is how they do it I suppose. The gal who answered the phone might have been new or in training. She did not know directions nor prices 100 percent as well as she should. However, someone was behind her coaching her. I am totally okay with that since she was super nice and answered all my questions. She asked if she could put me on hold, did not keep me on hold for very long, and asked if it was okay if she could inquire from the other person for help. I liked that. Getting there was another story. It is a little tricky to find but I finally pulled in at 10 minutes to appointment time. I was greeted immediately and brought up stairs. I was offered a drink and showed the relaxation room. My only gripe was the lady in there talking on the cell phone. It is called the Relaxation Room for a reason. Come on folks, shut it off please. ( this is not the salons fault though and the room is very pretty) I was picked up on time almost immediately after filling out my paperwork. Samantha was my massage therapist. I did not pay for the deep tissue massage. They did discuss that the Swedish Massage was a light to medium pressure. Samantha did a great job. She seemed to find all the knots. I am super ticklish at times too but all went well. After the massage I was greeted right away by the upstairs cashier and went shopping in the boutique downstairs. Everyone was very friendly and helpful towards me. Another drink for the road too. All in all, this was a very lovely experience. I probably would not go back, but through no fault of the Dolce. The non discounted prices and highly inconvenient locations are prohibitive. Perhaps when they offer a Groupon again I might reconsider or if they opened one up in the Downtown Phoenix/ Biltmore area.",positive
I went here once a week prior to a hair and makeup appointment I had booked for Saturday just to check the place out. I got my eyebrows waxed and all in all everything went well and my experience was overall very good. A few days later I got a call from Dolce telling me that my hair and makeup appointment that I made for 2:30 would now have to be moved to 3:00. Why you ask? Because the makeup artist they booked me with was not going to be there and now all the other makeup artists were booked up for 2:30. I called way ahead of time to book my appointment so something like this wouldn't happen. I called twice and got put on hold for 10-15 minutes once. It is extremely frustrating that I have to be in a rush now instead of being able to relax like one should be able to when paying for salon services. When talking to the girls who work at Dolce on the phone they told me that 3:00 was the best they could do and there's nothing else they can do. At this point I'd really like to cancel my appointment here and go to a different salon but it is too late to book something somewhere else.,negative
"Went to the Scottsdale location with a Groupon that was for a 60 min massage. I made sure I came 20 min early in case I needed time to change for the therapist. I ended up waiting in the lobby right until my appt time, which was fine because I assumed the 60 min would start once my therapist staryed massaging. About 15 min had past by the time she got started and she stopped right at the hour which meant I only got a 45 min massage (which was only average quality). I complained at the front desk but never heard from the manager or anyone so I wrote Groupon and got a refund. Never went back.",negative
I purchased a gift card for my wife and mother-in-law to have a nice mother and daughter day. They tried to schedule a spa day twice each time they were cancelled at the last moment. The last time they cancelled 45 minutes before the appointment!! I could not find another spay day on such sort notice. What a waste of money!,negative
"My (now) wife and I were looking for a wedding venue that fit us, but could accommodate us and our guests in the heat of June. Just as we were about to book a downtown warehouse (which would have been over our budget), we accidentally came across Affairs by Doco (run by and out of Dolce Salon & Spa at Arrowhead). With hot pink and neon green accent walls, and a chandelier suite, it was the perfect amount of funk and brought just a touch of class. The chandelier suite seated our 70 guests inside comfortably for dinner. There is a great outdoor space and would be wonderful to host an event in the winter, but worked splendidly for our evening wedding on a 111 degree day. Whitney, our event coordinator, was there through the whole process and transitioned the dining room to a dance floor while we were in the adjacent room cutting the cannoli (instead of cake). I would advise, there is limited space for bridal party/family pictures unless you like parking lot pictures, so my wife and I did a ""first look"" and took pictures with the bridal party ahead of time off-site. While the prices have gone up slightly since we booked, it's still cheaper than any of the other venues we looked at, we were able to bring in our own caterer, and didn't have to go through the hassle of renting tables, chairs, and linens on our own. A surprising service to be provided by a spa, but one they knocked out of the park.",positive
"I went with a level 2 stylist, big mistake. My cut was alot shorter than what I asked for, which isn't to big of a deal but the problem was that the cut is VERY uneven. I also had color which she struggled with. Luckly I ended up leaving with a normal color after she said it had turned purple. Highly suggest you go with a higher level stylist!!",negative
"Katie is great! They were helpful at the desk and gave my daughter a great cut. I love their specials and follow them on facebook, but I probably wouldn't pay full price because i'm cheap.",positive
"I have been a client for 4 years. I had a friend donating her hair to my sister who has cancer. I wanted to plan a spa day of her and I and wanted to know if there were any specials due to that circumstance. I also wanted to find out if they had any suggestions on where to make the wig. I was still accepting the circumstances of my sisters situation and sometimes cry if I talk out loud about it so I chose email to make it easier on myself. No response. I comment on their wall on how long it takes to respond to emails. Still no response. I had contacted other places and they got back to me but I really wanted to hear back from them because I wanted to boom with my favorite person there. Well, I have up and decided to go with another company. Whatever. But what makes me more mad than anything is that they still keep updating their Facebook and ignore me. But what's worse is they let some random commenter talk to me the way they did and still not respond. I was never rude. I never did anything wrong. And this is how I'm treated? I guess customer service is something they don't care about and now one of their best employees lost 2 clients forever.",negative
"WOW! I just had the best haircut of my life! I met Brody tonight for a cut and style at the Arrowhead loction and my experience with her was amazing. Before we got started, we chatted a bit about what I was looking for in a cut. She listened to what I wanted and delivered. She easily found things we had in common to chat about during the cut. I left feeling HOT with volume up to the sky! I cant wait to get my hands on my hair and see what I can do with it! Brody is a KEEPER! :)",positive
"Not satisfied with the way my hair turned out. Not what I envisioned :( Top looks lighter than the bottom. Magda, the stylist, was in a rush to get out of there. Will not be going back to her. Also, place is way over priced.",negative
"I'd like to qualify that this is really more of a 3.5 star place in my opinion, but of course Yelp doesn't offer that as an option. Also, full disclosure, I'm a total spa addict. I love going in to different places and getting facials and massages. In the past year, I've been to the Camelback Inn Spa, Joya Spa, and Elizabeth Arden Red Door Spa, in addition to Dolce. During Arizona's spa weeks when tons of spas offer services for $50, I've been known to go multiple times a week to different spas to get services. I've been going to Dolce since last year, when I got a gift card from my cousin. I've been back for several massages and facials since then and had a really great experience each time. Were the massages on par with the ones I've gotten at Joya or the Red Door Spa? No, of course not. The price differential is quite large, especially when you take into consideration that I never go to Dolce without using some kind of Facebook Hook Up, Groupon or Hunies to get at least half off the service. For the price that I'm paying, these services are awesome! You get the luxury atmosphere of the spa and a relaxing day without having to empty out everything in your wallet. While the services aren't on par with the ones I've received at places that have $200 massages, they also aren't charging $200 - hence my satisfaction. I love the 90-minute Swedish and Combination massages and my favorite masseuse is Sherrie, who's always giving me tips on how to reduce the stress on my back and arms from my desk job. I've never had a problem with the desk staff, as some other reviewers have noted below. It seems that a lot of the unhappy reviews are associated with salon services, which I've never tried, so they could be 100% valid. In terms of massages and facials, I think Dolce is a great place - just make sure to be on the look out for their Facebook deals to get a good price!",negative
"I got great good highlights from Zach at Arrowhead, when I was desperate for some decent color one sunny day.... I would 100% say you can trust him with your color, he does a very precise job with the foils and the natural blend appearance when its done is great... even as he uses several colors is just amazing how pretty it looks. He blends his toners and blends his colors so he really picks accurate and pretty shades. I also had dyed my hair myself so it was a bit orange and uneven colored in places and he actually fixed it. The next time I go and I will let him know I want to get a little more eclectic and Im sure it will look great. Ive had my hair colored and highlighted all over the world at various salons so I can tell he knows what he is doing and he is polite also. I also go to the Borgata location alot....I just had highlights from a Level 2 Alyssa..she was awesome and I would recommend because you save with a Level 2 and you will get GREAT quality color from her and I got a beautiful style blow out from her assistant Roxy who had adorable bright red hair. They will be my new GO TO girls!!! I again went to Borgata and had the most beautiful color done with Annette, Level 2 and she trimmed my bangs so perfect, long and I can swoop them prettily to the side..I have past shoulder length hair, long layers and Annette gave me the best blowout after the color. My hair looks FABULOUS. I highly recommend Annette, her work is beautiful! Both color and cut. Ya Ya... Another great level 2 is Katia/Katiya..not sure how to spell.",positive
"Went here Saturday with my mother-in-law for a mani/pedi and had a fabulous time! This place is huge...3 stories...wasn't expecting that. The nail technicians were super friendly and did a great job. The only ding is for the prices...We were able to use a Groupon to get 50% off standard pricing, but the regular total for two mani/pedis was $180.00. Yikes!",positive
"At the risk of sounding like everyone else, the only reason they got one star is because I had to give them one! First, I had my hair cut and colored here one time and the girl seemed mad my appointment was at 8 and then gave me the most bland hair I've ever had. I asked for the fringe bangs and she definitely gave me the same side swipe everyone else there had and my color was totally flat. Okay, so I decided to give them a second chance and scheduled a pedicure, manicure, cut and color for both my mom and myself. Huge mistake. I broke my collarbone three days before the appointment and told them that when I arrived. This way, they would not turn on the chair and be sensitive to how they moved me when doing services. My $85 pedicure did not include paraffin wax, nor clipping/shaping of my nails or any sort of pumice. The girl spent her time talking loudly to another girl at a nearby station and managed to smudge both my mom and I's nails. Oh, and turned the chair on to ""massage"" my hugely swollen, bruised, broken colloarbone. Whatever, just get me to the hair station. I told the girl, I want to go lighter with blonde highlights. My mom said lowlights and mostly, just cover the gray! I came out with jet black hair and my mother ended up with gray temples. My cut came out with side swept bangs and razored ends, which are TERRIBLE for thin, fine hair. My mom had some sort of long, bowl cut...horrible. They were both rude and basically wanted us out of their chairs. At the cash register, they brought us baskets full of product they had supposedly used. Um, no, they didn't use anything but shampoo and conditioner! We paid, my mom left a huge tip and we grimaced our way out. I went to another salon to fix my hair and my AWESOME stylist there called the salon to see what they had used so she could fix it. I could actually hear the manager screaming into the phone, saying they had no records of what had been done. That the stylist had ""forgot"" to write it down. Then proceded to call me a liar and demand that I go back to have it fixed by the same stylist. Uh, no thanks, chief. DO NOT USE THIS SALON EVER. I would suggest box color before these hair Hitlers.",negative
"Really shocked at the low reviews on here! I love Dolce and find that they offer many deals to stay competitive while giving the most excellent customer service ever! I had a Combo Massage at Arrowhead today with Paige! I am so hooked on her! She keeps the lights very low and doesn't talk during the massage unless you have a concern or question. I love that! Also, she listened to my problem areas and really designed the massage to help with my issues. This combo massage does a little deep tissue and some Swedish combined with Reflexology...and let me just say that the Reflexology part ROCKED even more than the rest of the awesome! She really used her strength to get a lot of tension out of my poor hoofers! I will most def be back with Paige @ Arrowhead! In fact, I will arrange my appointments around her availability! I'm hooked! As always the rest of the staff was very professional and helpful. I think you'd be silly to go elsewhere.........but if you do that makes it easier for me to get in!",positive
I am also a little surprised to see the poor reviews. I have been going to my stylist at this salon for about three years (may be more) - she is fantastic and my hair always looks great. I have also had pedicures there and one was really good - one of the technicians is not one of my favorite - but nothing over the top awful. I do agree it can be a bit pricey - but when they offer deals they are really great. I have had facials at other dolces and they are good (not great but good - again this depends on the technician). I may be biased and giving the four stars because my stylist is that great. But I don't think that the services is awful - I am always greeted - never pressured to book new services - and always happy when I leave.,positive
"I was gifted a coupon for $90 to Dolce and this location was closest to my house. When I called to make an appointment I had to listen to a machine, hit a number, listen some more, talk to a ""representative"" and then she connected me to the front desk. Ummm ok? A woman gave me some information on the facials I was interested in, and then suggested a peel and that I should come in to have a test patch done. I won't go into detail because it's been said, but the customer service is just AWFUL. I have never felt so unwelcome. I wonder if the only time these girls are nice is if their friends come in for a service. There were around five of them just standing around talking. I don't know where the unemployment rates are coming from because this Dolce has hired at least %10 of Arizona. After I was taken upstairs through a literal maze I was not asked any questions about my skin, I had to tell her what I was not happy with and what results I was looking for. She barely said anything except how crappy drugstore face washes are because they don't balance your PH and how I should buy face wash from Dolce, (no thanks I get all my stuff from Lush and it's fantastic, natural, and cheap.) Then she told me to lay down and proceeded to slop some goop on my neck, without even cleaning the area first. I don't wear make up on my neck but it does get hot outside so there must have been dust/sweat. She told me to make my appointment before I left, but if I had a reaction to the chemical I could call and change the service. Uhh no, how about I go home and decide when I feel like making another appointment? I was asked to walk by the front desk again for reasons unknown, they tried to book an appointment for me, I lied and said I would have to check my schedule and call them back. Over the next few days that patch of skin on my neck started peeling little white pieces of skin and would not stop for over a week. I know that is expected with peels but honestly I'm only 21 and I don't need that much of a miracle right now especially if I have to hide in my house for that long after. I ended up giving the gift certificate to my cousin who just had a baby. I figure she can try the Dolce down where she lives and get a nice massage. Not long after I found another coupon for a different spa and had the most relaxing facial and pleasant experience. Funny their location was a fraction of the size and had a handful of staff. I guess bigger isn't always better.",negative
"Unfortunately I have to agree with Penny Lane and Colleen M as my experience somewhat paralleled theirs. Upon walking into the salon, the front desk ladies didn't even acknowledge my friend and I. They saw us walk in but then turned their backs to resume chatting with each other. When we approached the front desk, I had to do a polite ""ah hem"" to get someones attention. The two girls were less than thrilled to have their conversation interrupted. This became obvious when they proceeded to check us in without ANY conversation whatsoever. We did get a ""is this your first time here"" in the elevator on the way upstairs to the salon. My friend and I were both pleased that the rudeness we experienced downstairs didn't carry out with the other staff members. We each had a massage/facial/hair style and makeup application and the ladies tending to us were really sweet. Aside from the constant attempts to sell their products, it was a nice experience. Overall it was a nice atmosphere if you are into vintage chic, damask and TONS of colorful chandeliers. We both enjoyed a wonderful massage and facial. Pass on a style or makeup application though; neither of us were pleased with our results. Once you get past the front desk, the experience isn't bad at all; but I've definitely experienced a more relaxing/delightful spa day elsewhere.",negative
"I first learned about Dolce as a volunteer for Girls Night Out. Since then, I have visited the salon and spa to ""treat"" myself to haircuts, manicures, massages, and facials. Dolce is a true escape and you pay for what you get in terms of service and atmosphere. Keep in mind that there are many deals to be had at Dolce. The best secret is to get on their email list and mailing list. You will be mailed steals and deals that make such pampering affordable (ex: a $45 hair cut and style for $25). Dolce cares about the community as well as their clients. I will continue to give my business to them and encourage others to do the same.",positive
"I got an AMAZING facial here, very pleased, and no upselling at the end. Everyone was pleasant, professional, and I got great value for the money. I am recommending it to all my f2f friends, and to you!",positive
"I walked into Dolce before seeing a movie next door at Harkins. Don't waste your time or money here, esp when there are so many other choices in the Valley. This place is way overpriced and the service is awful! You'd expect with all the money they spent to have this upscale-looking place, they would hire people who could at least greet you and not act so snotty. Calling Dolce is a pain in the butt too, you feel like you are calling a Call Center routing you to a specific department. Why can't the women at the counter just pick up and answer the frickin' phone?",negative
"I went there to pick up some Bumble and Bumble product since the Bb website said they carried that line. I walked in and I was the only one there (Monday afternoon). There were three girls at the counter and not a single one of them even acknowledged that I was there. I spent several minutes locating the product because the packaging had changed, still no one asked to assist me or if I was there for an appointment. When I found my product I walked over to the counter and the three women proceeded to ignore me for another minute or so. When they finally decided to assist me, they were very short, and put out by me wanting to purchase something. Then they handed me my product with no bag and turned their back to me. I had a question I needed to ask them and they were not happy that I was bothering them. I had always wanted to go there for a spa day but I think I will pass from now on. Their priced on Bb are more expensive than anywhere else. I think I will stick with driving to Scottsdale for my salon needs.",negative
"Not sure how they survive. The salon is pretty but that is about it. Calling to make an appointment is a nightmare. Half of the time you can't get anyone to pick-up. Most of the time if I get someone on the phone I have to wait over 5 minutes and listen to the most irritating recording over and over. My technician is awesome and lI live five minutes away, so that is why I keep going back. It is clean. The girls at the reception desk should not be in customer service. It is just overall poorly managed. The prices are the highest in the west valley. Do not drive out of your way for the salon.",negative
"this was my first experience at Dragonfly Gypsy and i am in love! my eyelash extensions were perfectly placed, a lot of care and precision was taken. wonderful atmosphere as well (i enjoyed the one on one instead of a busy salon with lots going on).

She did an amazing job and she woudn't let me see my hair until she was done taking picures :-) I am so happy I found her and I'll be coming back again and again. I can't wait to see what she does when I go in for cut and color :-),positive
"Have always gotten great coloring and cuts from Cheryl and that's really saying something. I've gone from long flowing locks to ridiculously cute short bobs. I've also been brunette, blonde, siren red, hot pink, and blonde with purple tips, ALL done by Cheryl and ALL FANTASTIC!",positive
Cheryl is amazingly talented! I didn't know what to expect with my very 1st eyelash experience but ....OMG! They are amazing and she did such a wonderful job. I get complimented all the time on my eyelashes and many people have no clue they are extensions! I won't be going anywhere else and I can't wait to see her talents when I have her color/cut my hair.,positive
"Best stylist in Las Vegas, even when I moved to Los Angeles, I trust no one else to my cut and color and make trips to visit family and always book an appointment with Ecktor when I'm in town. He incorporates Aruvedic techniques into his hair care that makes my scalp feel so revived, it takes 10 years off me in one visit. I always get tons of compliments on my hair cut and color. He's a master colorist, master stylist, very professional and understanding. I highly recommend his services.",positive
"I found Ecktor at my Las Vegas layover pre-vaca and went to him to get vacation-ready hair! I was in for an amazing surprise. I LOVED the service from beginning to end. From the tea, hair wash, hot towel facial to the actual haircut with precision and detail to give me the volume I desired while maintaining my hair length - he's a hair genius! And super sweet person. I wish he was local to me because I'd be a regular! Thanks a ton Ecktor! Loving the life my hair has again :)",positive
I met Ecktor through my family and my favorite part of each visit is him always going above and beyond. He really understands how your hair falls and should be cut (not without your direction mind you) and gives a great temple massages at the end of the hair wash. I feel very confident after each haircut with Ecktor as my hair stylist,positive
"I have been a true customer to Ecktor for years. I love his honesty and passion for life. He is upbeat, energetic and does brilliant stylist work. His creativity and ability to see outside the box with design, color and style is what sets him above other stylists. I highly recommend that anyone come see him! He isn't a beautician ...he is a magician!",positive
"I was fortunate enough to meet Ecktor one evening at work and that's when he left me his business card. From there it was a done deal. Not only does he have an amazing personality...he has a talent for hair. I love the way he cuts, colors and styles my hair and keeps me thoroughly entertained while working his magic. He also does my daughters hair. We love Ecktor and will not go anywhere else.",positive
"What is there to say about Ecktor other then that he's the best damn cutter of hair I have ever met in my 29 years. He's passionate about his craft, will recommend product to use if you inquire, and will help to bring the beauty that you are into the light! Not only is he super talented, but once you get to know him he will act as your therapist. This has saved me tons of money!! I could go on and on about Ecktor, but I will just end this review with one last bit of advice. Call and schedule an appointment with Ecktor as soon as you can, it will change your life!!",positive
Eector has been cutting my hair for years now. I've gone through many hair styles. He has been very good at giving me the haircut I ask for and giving his advice as to what's the new hairstyle that's in. Eector is always very professional and by the end of the hour I always leave feeling relaxed and confident. I'd classify him not only as a hair stylist but as a therapist too.,positive
"Ecktor is by far my favorite stylist! I've been moving state to state the past 10 years and ended up in Vegas about two years ago. I've been all over from New York to Miami to Beverly Hills... you name it and I've been there, so I feel I can offer a good comparison. I am very picky with who I see but my friend encouraged me to give Ecktor a try as he had done wonders on her hair. I wasn't disappointed! He is very professional and you can tell he loves what he does. Getting a good hair cut is one thing, getting a perfect hair cut by someone who is passionate in their work and amazing at their job is a completely different thing and he delivers on this. I highly recommend him and without a doubt he is the best stylist I've been to.",positive
I really liked how everyone was super friendly and easy to talk to but when I pay for a blowout and style I want what I pay for. I could've easily blow dried my hair at home for free and have it turn out exactly if not better than how it looked after getting my hair done today. No volume - flat and boring hair. I would most definitely not return for a blow dry and style.,negative
"I have been going to Ecco now for almost 5 years and it is the only salon I trust. The stylist are so friendly and helpful. They are a teaching salon and it shows in how up to date they are with all the new techniques. I go to ether Sarah Beth or Laura. Either I would highly recommend for coloring and cuts. I have gone brown, red, and platinum blonde over the years and they have done a fabulous job every time.",positive
"I brought in my two daughters (4 and 5) last night for haircuts. Grace did an excellent job of making them feel comfortable given it was their first time at Ecco. She listened to their request but was great about checking with me to ensure that was really what I wanted done with their hair. She even curled their hair at the end, of course asked me first if it was ok, and the girls left saying they felt like princesses! Thank you, Grace!",positive
"From the moment I entered, I was treated with an upmost respect and positivity. I was offered a beverage while I filled out a 'first time customer' information form. Promptly after I finished that information, I was taken back to get my hair cut. I was lucky enough to get a wonderful conversationalist and talented stylist, Jessica. I came in with a vision for my hair cut and she delivered exactly what I wanted within a reasonable amount of time. I would recommend ECCO Salon to anyone who is insecure about getting their hair cut to go to Jessica and she will work with you to get the look you desire. Overall, I'm very delighted with my experience and will be back for more my next time back in Wisconsin.",positive
"I have naturally curly hair and struggled my way through various salons and a few terrible cuts before finding Ecco last winter. I was horribly nervous that I'd receive another bad cut from someone who didn't really know how to properly cut curly hair, but my concerns were unfounded--Sara Beth has been nothing but wonderful. I trust her implicitly with cuts and coloring--she's consistently excellent, and I'm so grateful to have found someone so talented in Madison. I can't recommend her (or the salon) enough.",positive
"Came in after hearing about this place in Epic's list of discounted places. 15% off first service. Friendly and professional staff! I was greeted immediately and the front desk employee took my coat for me and got me water (offered other drinks too) to drink while I waited, which is so simple but very welcoming and kind! My stylist, Stephanie, was a good listener and did a great job explaining the Aveda products, styling, and hair maintenance. They also respected my need of sulfate-free shampoo during the service as SLS makes me scalp break out, and I appreciated them accommodating that need. I'm happy with my haircut! Great experience overall and will return.",positive
"Cut was good but utterly ruined my haircolor! I went in for my roots to be touched up and for purple to be dyed on top of my existing blonde hair. Not a terribly difficult task as I dye my own hair at home and get pretty good results having blonde hair. My stylist EL said it might come out a bit darker but would still be ""vibrant"" purple. I'm not terribly picky so I said that would be fine as long as it was purple... we'll low and behold it turns out stark black! I went in a second time for them to fix it by just lightening it up to a ""light purple"". The entire time I received attitude from the stylist and walked out with maroon hair. I overpaid for hair I need to wait and grow out to get rid of- what a rip off. Very dissapointed and highly recommend people find other salons if they want non natural color.",negative
"I had Ashley cut and color my hair this evening. I thought the color looked ok when I was there but got home and found it way too dark and way too red. Ick. I never asked for dark red. Also, the cut was barely anything. I'm not sure why I even paid for it. It doesn't look any different than it did when I walked in the door. $100 down the toilet. Now I get to try to lift the color out with dish soap. Yay! Fun way to spend an evening!",negative
"Great service and style from ""L"" (they have 2 Lindseys, so this stylist goes by ""L""). She's amazing with color - incredible job with blending and highlights. Lovely scalp massage + aromatherapy every time. It was nice to get a discount on the second visit when it was scheduled after the 1st visit!",positive
I'm from Madison but live in Chicago and make trips back solely to go to this salon. My usual go-to girl was booked the last weekend I happened to be in town (last week) and I went to Marie instead. I loved her. She was super sweet and definitely talented. I had a great experience and think she did a great job on my hair and brows!,positive
Always satisfied with Laura at Ecco. Always a pleasant expereince. Love love love the scalp massage. It would be nice to offer loyalty discounts to frequent customers.,positive
"This review will be purely about eyebrow waxing/shaping. I tend to grow out my eyebrow hair for a couple weeks when I find that I have butchered them in between maintenance. I don't know if this makes it necessarily more difficult or easier on an aesthetician (more to work with, I guess?), but this was the ""setting"" so to speak of what they started with whenever I came in for an appointment. On one of my visits, I came in with bushy brows, and came out with brows that were thin, had no arch or shape, and my left one had the tail-end separated from the rest of the brow. Jamie had done my eyebrows then, and to put it simply, I do not recommend her for this particular task. I don't know if it was because she was inexperienced or I just came in on a bad day. If it was due to inexperience, I wouldn't want to be the next person blindly scheduled with her for an eyebrow waxing. My visit after that, I came in with the same bushy brows but exited with fierce, perfect, diva-esque arches that I did not think were possible. JoJo did them that time (and everytime after that). I was so impressed that she shaped them very well without having a too-thin look. I HIGHLY recommend her if you need your brows to be livened up. (+) Contemporary ambience (+) Refreshments available (+) Friendly staff (+) JoJo for brows! (-) Noisy",positive
"I've been getting my hair cut at Ecco for over 3 years. The atmosphere is modern and cool. Everything is clean, and everyone is friendly. I would definitely recommend Ecco. I am pretty trustful of any stylist at an Aveda salon, so I'm not very particular about who I go to at Ecco. I've had my hair cut by many of their stylists. THE BEST So far, my favorite stylist has been Sarah T. She really took her time with the details, and I left feeling pretty, confident, and loving my new hairstyle. THE WORST The only stylist I haven't liked has been Marie. She was kind of rough. I also felt like she was rushing. I have a lot of hair, so it felt like she was overwhelmed and didn't have time to do a good job. When she took the cape off I was kind of shocked that she was done cutting my hair. She said if I needed it fixed, I could come back later in the week. If you can already tell that my hair looks bad and will need to be fixed, why are you letting me go out into the world with bad hair?!?!?!? I won't be going back to her ever again, but every other stylist I've had at Ecco has been great, so I will be back.",positive
"This was my first time at this salon. Based on my overall experience, I'm giving them a below average rating. The salon itself is clean and modern. However, because of the loft ceilings, sound seemed amplified. It was busy, very noisy, and the complete opposite of a relaxing experience. The receptionist was friendly and offered a beverage upon arrival, which was much appreciated. My stylist (Marie Nee) did not meet my expectations, and is the main reason for my below average rating. During shampooing and conditioning, she applied an extreme amount of pressure to my head/scalp. It was harsh and unpleasant. When she finished the haircut with my wet hair, she never asked if I liked the length. She was conservative on how much length she took off. (I suppose it's better to be conservative than to cut off too much hair.) However, it's the responsibility of the stylist to check with the client on how much length they want cut. My stylist did not do that. She then blow dried my hair and dry-cut long layers. I requested face-framing layers, but the stylist stated that my hair would look like a mullet. What?! It appeared as if she did not want to finish the haircut. (Not sure if she was running late and had another client waiting or what the deal was.) She seemed to rush me out of her chair and told me to go home, and if I needed to get the haircut fixed, I could return to the salon in the next few days. Wow, really? If she did a good job, there would not be a reason to offer that service! Upon returning home, I ended up fixing my own face-framing layers. It's always a bad sign when you have to fix your own haircut after a ""professional"" has cut it. Thumbs down. I may or may not go back to this salon. I will certainly request a different stylist.",negative
"I have been going to Ecco for years and I was so happy to see that they recently won ""Best of Madison"". No salon is more deserving. All the stylists and staff are so friendly and welcoming. They always offer a beverage shortly after arriving and the chocolate in the waiting area is a nice treat as well :) The complimentary hand massages are a nice way to relax while your color processes. I recently convinced my husband to go to Ecco and he raved about the service. He has already set up his next appointment. The scalp massages while getting your hair rinsed are so wonderful, I wish I could get one every week! I recommend this salon to everyone I can. They are the best!",positive
"I have never had such a great experience getting my eyebrows waxed. As far as I'm concerned, Mollie is the best in the Madison area. Also, if you book your second appointment at the time of your first service, you get a discount which is an awesome perk.",positive
"I love Ecco! All of the staff here are professional and do a great job! I second the review on Mollie's work-- she does wonderful brows! For hair, definitely schedule with Jenny, you will not be sorry! : )",positive
I had Mollie wax my eyebrows. By far THE best job anyone has ever done on my brows. I've been getting them waxed for many years. I tried Ecco out because it is 5 minutes from my work. This is where I plan to go from now on to get my eyebrows done. Everyone was friendly.,positive
"I enjoy this salon. I've now returned for my 4th or 5th time seeing Rebecca and it has always been a pleasant experience. The use of Aveda products and the head massage with the cut and color makes this an upscale experience. They always offer herbal tea and chocolate as you wait. As an at home mom, this is my refuge. I can easily book appointments in the afternoons which is ideal for me. The parking is a bit strange due to the building layout. I usually park across the street and have to cross Cheryl Drive which gets some speedy, on the go, talking on cellphone drivers leaving the subdivision. Please slow down people!",positive
"I have been going to Enlighten Studio for over five years now! Before Yvonne and the team, I never went to a salon more than twice ever in my life. But, Yvonne created the best look for me and my hair type and I am forever thankful! I'm going to be a client for life and have referred at least five other people who are now also regular clients. Yvonne is a master of color, on the leading edge of hair education and is one of the top stylists in the state.",positive
"I've been a customer of Enlighten Studio for almost 2 years. I get my hair cut, colored, or smoothed out on a regular basis, and its always a great experience. Yvonne is my stylist and she does a fantastic job, I love my hair! Yvonne put me totally at ease when i initially came in with damaged over processed hair. I have always been happy with the service at this salon. I can't say enough good things about this location!",positive
"If I could give zero stars I would. Yvonne and team where hired for my daughters wedding, we had nothing but trouble from the trial through to the wedding. The trial took over 5 hours; the team never completed my daughter's makeup or hair; they were unprepared and did not have the proper tools to complete a look. I was booked for a trial as well, my hair was done however, makeup was never attempted. Throughout the experience the team had many excuses; they couldn't do thin/fine hair, they couldn't do braids, they couldn't color-match the extensions they insisted my daughter needed. The day of the wedding they spent hours doing everyone but the bride. By the time they got to the bride it was a rushed job and the stylist had no idea how to style my daughter's hair. The bridal party had to completely redo the brides hair and makeup once we arrived at the venue delaying the entire timeline; because of the delay many pictures where lost which we can NEVER get back. We were very disappointed by the services we received. Yvonne was difficult to work with, unable to accept responsibility, hard to get in contact with, gives false hope and ultimately was unable to follow through on her promises. The biggest regret my daughter has for her wedding was choosing enlightened studios, don't make the same mistake.",negative
"I've been looking for a salon where I feel comfortable, get a good hair cut and highlights, and actually want to go back again. This place did just that for me today-easy to set up an appointment, no sales pitch for every product in the place (only what would help), and two ladies who really know their stuff. I had a partial highlight and a cut-Leah did a great job of blending the layers together better and gave me tips on how to section my hair for curling. If you ladies do any classes like you were mentioning, I'm totally there!",positive
"Really cute spot and a great location with plenty of parking in the back and on the street. Leah and the other stylist there were so incredibly friendly, it was a breath of fresh air just to sit and chat. It was a welcome escape from the pretension often found in Old Town. Not only was the atmosphere and company great, but Leah gave me a great haircut. I have curly hair and asked that she keep as much length as possible, but gave her free reign with the style. I left with pretty layers appropriate for my length and hair type, plus she managed to make my awful, grown-out self-cut bangs look like they were done on purpose. Can't wait to go back! Really a great find, and I love the online booking!",positive
"Yvonne is amazing!!! I gave my mother as a birthday present a consultation with Yvonne. Yvonne had to correct my mother's hair color. Her color and her hair cut were perfect!!! She's no longer want to color her own hair. Yay!!!! Yvonne just got a new client for life. On a side note, we moved here from Texas and visited several hair styles but no one compares to Yvonne's professionalism, knowledge, positive attitude and price.",positive
Enlighten Studios is awesome. Yvonne always has a positive attitude and does a fantastic job. I don't get anything fancy but she always takes time to style it and teach me as well. Would recommend 100%.,positive
Leah did a great job. She took time to figure out what I was looking for and also gave me tips on how to take care of my fair in this dry heat since I just moved here.,positive
"I have been going to Yvonne since 2005. Every time I have Yvonne cut and color my hair, I get so many compliments. I had an appointment before the 4th of July. We went to a party in Vegas, I received so many compliments, it was great. Yvonne takes a lot of time with each client, she is amazing! There's no one else like her!",positive
What a delightful experience! Yvonne was so knowledgeable and willing to take the time to explain information about my desires for hair color. Such an expert in her field! She's 100% real - no pretense here! Prices for services are below what you'd expect to pay in Scottsdale. I'm very impressed and pleased with my color and cut! Great appointment and I've got my next appointment booked! I found Enlighten Salon through Instant Barter. Thanks Yvonne!,positive
I have never had a more personal and friendly haircut before in my life. Yvonne took the time to ask basic questions about my lifestyle and past haircuts so she could tailor a personal cut to fit my needs. I was a little reluctant at first but I'm in love with my hair and the style far exceeded my expectations. No one else is allowed to touch my hair!!! Already booked my next appointment. I'll be back.,positive
"I've always had trouble figuring out my hair, especially since I stopped coloring. I'm mostly gray, so my hair has frizz issues and feels dry. Yvonne has an excellent intake form- she covers everything from your general lifestyle to exactly what you like and don't like about your hair. Then she sits and talks to you so she knows a little more about you. It helps her figure out a hair style that works for how you live. She also gave me many tips about taking care of gray hair and making it look and feel amazing. It was a great experience, and she has gained a new client because of how personal her service is.",positive
Best cut and color I have had in the 10 years living in Phoenix. I drove from San tan valley (1hour) just to have Yvonne and Leah do my hair. I am never going anywhere else again!,positive
Yvonne and the crew are Awesome! Personalized service and they do a great job. Yvonne really knows her stuff and is very talented.,positive
"If you're looking for a salon for everyday needs or for a special occasion (wedding) then you have found the answer with Enlighten Studio. I'm a wedding planner and I've used Enlighten Studio for a photo shoot, wedding clients, and personally. The service is top notch and I refer them with pride!",positive
"Enlighten Studio is the best salon of which you've never heard. Owner Yvonne has a heart as big as her talent. The time you spend at the Studio will fly by quickly as Yvonne entertains and resolves your bad hair issues simultaneously. The salon is easy to find, there's plenty of parking and the prices are super reasonable. You'll be happy that you went - I promise!",positive
I have a real sensitive scalp and have left other salons with my scalp feeling as if it was on fire. Yvonne at Enlighten Studio makes sure my scalp is rinsed really well and takes the time other salons haven't in the past to assure things are done right!,positive
This is one of my favorite places to go for me time! Enlighten never disappoints you and you will always feel like a million bucks when you leave! My son refuses to get his hair cut anywhere else! ;-),positive
I love this place! The staff is friendly and knowledgable and do a great job. The salon is clean and has a classic feel to it. Location has great parking.,positive
"Another great experience at Enlighten Studio yesterday! Had an appointment with Yvette for a 1/2 leg wax. Yvette was very personable, professional, and quick.",positive
"Yvonne at Enlighten Salon gave me my first first perm in over 15 years!! Shhh, don't tell because I recieved so many compliments that were as follows, ""You should quit straightening your hair, it looks beautiful natural!"" AWESOME!!!!",positive
"Mary Lou us accommodating and pleasant. The salon is clean, cozy, comfortable, and inviting. Have been a customer for almost 30 years and have never been disappointed in her precision cuts and other services.",positive
Mary Lou is by far the best hairdresser ever! Her attention to detail is superior!! I don't trust anyone else with my hair. Her cuts and styles are great but the color is exceptional.,positive
"I have been going to Mary Lou for over 10 years now for my hair and she is the best of the best! Not only does she have the most well kept, beautiful, and welcoming salon...but she is extraordinary at her craft. She loves her job and is passionate about making her clients feel their best! Mary Lou has become not only my stylist but one of my dear friends whom I look forward to catching up with at every hair appointment. I have moved away for college and for jobs and no matter how far away I am, I always come home to get my hair done because I know the end result will always be outstanding. I have not only experienced her skill and kindness first hand but have been privileged enough to see her interact with other clients with the most sincere, kind, caring, and welcoming spirit. Mary Lou's skill set in exceptional in all aspects including color, cut, styling, wax, color correction, and the list goes on. I would highly recommend her as well as her salon and I cannot say enough good things. There's a lot to say for an individual who is so talented at her work but also so passionate about her work!",positive
Been going to expressions and Mary Lou for years I highly recomend her. She always gives the best service with competitive prices.,positive
"Mary Lou operates her hair salon on the first floor of her 2-story Stow home. She provides service that is personal and dedicated. It is like visiting a good friend for coffee. She offers honest advice when clients ask for big changes or ""the usual."" The petite salon ambience is warm and homey with dark hardwood floors, a fireplace, complimentary coffee/herbal teas/soda. Prices are reasonable, ample off street parking, and expert care for male and females. Mary Lou's attention to detail keeps her ""regulars"" coming back--including me.",positive
"Not only did Dee get me in last-minute, she did an incredible job on my long, thick hair. I will update with further info once Jackie does my color next Monday.",positive
Had my hair colored and cut by Jackie. Clean beautiful salon and she and her mom could not have been nicer. She took the time to listen to my concerns and was able to fix a bad previous color. Will definitely be back again and will recommend to friends. Great find in the South Hills!,positive
Jackie and Dee are truly the best. I love my color and my daughter always feels like a million when Dee gets done cutting and styling her hair.,positive
"I made an appointment here after seeing the amazing reviews on Yelp. I was a bit nervous walking in because I've had trouble finding a good hair dresser, and have had many not so good haircuts. However, I was so happy when I walked out of the salon. Dee took the time to listen to me and what I wanted. She looked at my face shape and my hair type and gave me a haircut that I am beyond happy with. I will definitely be back!",positive
"This place is awesome. Its a family business run by 3 people. I went in for a haircut late evening and was pleasantly surprised. The service was top notch and the people were extremely nice as well. John is such a great person to talk to. For the quality of service they offer, the prices are extremely modest!... I would definitely recommend this place to everyone.",positive
"Great salon! Jackie is amazingly talented with hair color. My color was awful the first time I went to her, thanks to another salon messing the color up royally. Jackie took her time and talked to me about how I wanted my hair to look. She worked her magic and I am happy to say that my color now looks amazing and she was able to correct the bad color from before. I highly highly recommend this salon!!",positive
"I had dyed my hair in April and wanted to get it back to a natural color. I had no idea what to do, I went in to Jackie and she had me come in for a consultation to figure out what to do. She was so knowledgeable about what to do that we did it that day! She and Dee are delights to have service from. I went through the whole process of dyeing my hair and came out with a more than fantastic result. The shop is small, intimate, and well maintained so you know all of their attention is focused on you and getting the results you want. I highly recommend going here to get anything done. They are wonderful with their work and delights to be around!",positive
"Jackie was beyond phenomenal. I've never had a better cut, color and style in my life (I am from California and have been to some pretty spectacular fancy salons), plus it was more ""me"" than I could have imagined! Jackie took her time to get to know me and my personality and didn't have the pressure of get in and get out like most salons do. After talking for a little while she recognized me as a versatile person, which I completely am! I go to conservative functions but have a bit of a flare in my personality. We created a cut that I have never heard of- but am now in love with- and a color with both high and low lights that when worn in certain ways fits my flared personality and shows off more color. If I wear my hair at a different part it hides the bolder highlights and makes me presentable for conservative politics and Grandma (who also loved it but greeted me with ""Who is this stunning woman and where has my granddaughter gone!"") I can not say enough about how wonderful Jackie is! I had the time and so she took three and a half hours to get to know exactly what I wanted (even if I didn't know myself) cut to perfection, high and low lights in strategic positions, blow dry and curl all for less than a normal set of highlights costs at other salons!! My only complaint is I live in Aspen Colorado and she is not there! I will be visiting her every time I visit family in PA!",positive
"This small salon is operated by the talented Dee and her equally talented daughter Jackie. Jackie colors and Dee cuts. Jackie's coloring is great - every job is a work of art as she works her magic. Dee's cuts are great - I have very fine hair, and she always makes the best of it. Every client I see leaving the place looks awesome.",positive
This updated review is not for any person that works there or services received. It is for walking through the door and greeted pleasantly enough then promptly asked if I had an appointment. I do not. It is two-thirty and I am gleefully told I cannot he seen until 4:30 PM. It clearly states walk-ins welcome on the door. I guess just not today. I am currently at Great Clips this high is a mile up the road. Granted they don't do color only cuts and on a Sunday morning my weight is 20 minutes. I received a cut I'm super happy with so it worked out well.,negative
I have been bringing my boys there for some time and each time I go-they tend to get worse in cutting my kids hair. I end up going back home evening out the side and back. It's so frustrating. I would have paid them but since it was close to Christmas I paid but I will not be going back there again.,negative
I will never go here or to any fantastic sams ever again. I went in for a hair cut with layers. They didn't blow dry it so when I got home I dryed my hair and it looked horrible! The layers were SO short and straight acr,negative
"Casey- my ""stylist""- was obviously not into being at work, I believe he was sick, so I gave him the benefit of the doubt. We spoke not a word during my haircut. Fine by me. It was weird he kept having me turn my head all the way to the right and all the way to the left. I've never had a stylist ask that before. My cut was a bit shorter than I wanted but it's hair and it will grow. What's not ok is after my first wash I noticed just how bad the cut is. Not even at all. I wanted a straight cut, no layers. Simple. The front pieces are two different lengths. The back is at least 3 lengths. This was the worst cut I've had in my 30 years of life and that's saying a lot considering I lived through the 90s with bangs. I used to get great cuts at the Location on Stephanie St in Henderson. Will not return to this location.",negative
"It was our first time here. We usually go somewhere else, but realized we pay so much there but always get a crappy cut! We didn't have an appointment, but literally waited for 2 minutes before someone got started on my son. Gabby (sp?) did an awesome job. Showed her a picture of what he wanted, and I knew it would be kind of difficult being that he had a MoHawk and wanted to transition to a side sweep type cut. She explained exactly how she'd do it and what would be the best way and did her thang! I mean, it wasn't anything spectacular, I'm sure she does this all the time, but My son loves it, that's all that matters! Everyone there was friendly and engaged with their clients, it was nice.",positive
Michael is amazing! We got him by chance and insist on seeing him every time now! Haircuts exactly what we want! Spends quality time! A treat to go get a good scalp massage & haircut! Color is great- even fixed a co-worker's mistakes! Pampering on a budget- this is the place to go!,positive
I was ignored for 1&1/2 hours because I had a beard and long hair. Stylists are lazy and don't care about losing customers . I would rather pay the extra money to go somewhere else where I would be appreciated and welcome.,negative
"Tried new hair place to get my hair cut. Young guy cut my hair. Clearly new at cutting hair. Poor job, didn't trim sideburns or clean the hair on the back of my neck. He even argued with me when I asked him to take more off the top. Went back to my regular stylist the next day and got my hair properly cut. My stylist and I had a good laugh and i promised not to try anymore new stylist. Fantastic Sam lose my number.",negative
"From entering the front door to being done with my haircut, under 5 minutes elapsed! It took me longer to get there than to get my hair cut, which is a win for me. I requested a pretty simple chop, and they did it, and fast. The going rate for a cut is $14.99, and you can get a 10% discount by checking in on yelp, or for you seniors out there, 10% off on services MTW. Pretty cheap. Lots of lot parking and friendly staff to be found inside. I will definitely be back if I need another haircut while I'm in the area.",positive
This has been my go to salon for the last two years. Jaqueline is truly talented and does an amazing job on my hair. The prices are fantastic and the wait times are minimal. All of the employees are professional and really friendly.,positive
Went in Feb 10 for a perm... I get one a year. My hair is straight at the ends and looks awful. Went back in and she conditioned it and cut some off but its still straight. I'm really disappointed by my experience. I've never had my hair turn out like this before.,negative
"Obviously everyone is picky about their hair, as it is your appearance and I have had some very bad experiences with highlighting and cuts in my 55 years. I just moved to the N. Las Vegas area approx. 6 weeks ago and saw this Fantastic Sams and decided to pray and hope that I would get a good result to get my hair highlighted and cut. I had ""Crystal"" as my hair stylist. I couldn't be more happy and pleased!!!!! Turned out perfect color I wanted and I feel and look great and she is hired. Lol. I will go back to her when it's time for a re-cut or touch up. She fussed and curled and made me feel and look great when I was done. Thank you Crystal, Great Job!!!!!! :)",positive
"Jacqueline was the best! I was able to walk right in for a cut and color. Everyone was cheery and pleasant even though it was 9 am on a Saturday. I was so nervous about cutting my long hair and worried that because I didn't know exactly what I wanted, I'd end up unhappy. This couldn't be further from the truth! Not only did Jacqueline help me pick a great color, she listened to my ramblings about what I was basically looking for in a cut. The finished result was amazing! I really couldn't be happier and will definitely be going back.",positive
Went to fantastic Sams on Ann Rd crystal was my stylist wow she is amazing I'm so happy i love my cut and color best i have ever got in my life.. i highly recommend her best experience thank you so much i will let my friends know and i well be back...,positive
"I took my 4 year old son in for a haircut. When I left, his hair was still wet, and when it dried, it was completely uneven everywhere! Not to mention the fact that the girl used thinning shears on him and he said the haircut hurt! Not wanting to go back to the same girl, I called them and they told me to come at 10 in the morning and the manager would fix it. My husband took our son back at 10 am and was told that the manager was not there, but on her way. At 10:45, she still had not shown up and my husband finally left. I have had a couple of nice, professional hair cuts there, but the black woman with the gap in her teeth (I do not know her name) is terrible. IF you decide to take your chances here, avoid her at all costs!",negative
"Located at the corner of Ann and Decatur, this relatively new Fantastic Sam's location may have become my new home for haircuts. One of the hardest things for me to find has been consistency and my do is really quite basic. I think I may have found it! Tabitha took care of me this time, but I've had both Crystal and Tabitha on previous visits. They are both ""fantastic"" and I have been pleased with the do every time. Granted they are still offering grand opening prices, but where else can you get a decent haircut and a relaxing shampoo for twelve bucks? I can't comment on their products or other services such as hair coloring or styling for long hair, but for me and my short hair, this was a four star experience.",positive
You have to ask for jackie. She's awesone. Plus when I went there was a deal on all cuts. So my hair cut was only 11$. I drove all the way from Henderson. And did I mention Jackie is awesome!,positive
"I had a $34.99 coupon for ""all over hair color"" at this Fantastic Sams location only. I drove there to give it a try. Before I entered, there was a banner outside ""Hair color $39.99"". A lady ""Tabitha"" was at the counter. I told her that I was there for an all over hair color. She immediately said, ""It's $49.99."" I said, ""I have a coupon for $34.99. Besides, the banner outside said $39.99."" She said, ""That price is for short hair. Long hair extra."" My hair length is only a little below my earlobes! I said, ""Mine is short! This is way above shoulder. I thought shoulder length and below is considered long hair."" She said, ""Did you go to beauty school?"" I probably should have left with that first clue. But the way she said it was soft, and it could be a real question, so I answered, ""I heard that from other hair places."" She then said with my coupon, she would give me the $5 discount to make it $44.99. I agreed as I was already there. My hair dye task is an easy, all over black color. Other places had asked me what type of black (brownish, reddish, blue, straight, etc.) and sometimes show samples of colors but she never bothered and just went ahead with a black color. Shortly after she started with me, a customer walked in. She left me and went to ask that lady what's needed and told that lady, ""I will be ready for you in 20 minutes once I am done with her."" I had never had hair coloring for only 20 minutes. Surely, it was more than 20 minutes when she left me for that lady, but she did not finish half of my hair. She spent 40 minutes with the lady before she came back to finish coloring my hair. I don't believe that's the correct way to do it as the whole head has two different coloring time. Along the side of my face was painted a thick layer of black color during this time. Since she didn't use any hair clips but just held different bunches by hand (with gloves), some piles dropped on my face and left black marks right on the face. Finally she washed my hair. I was hoping all the black ink would be gone. But no, it was lighter but obvious along the side of my face and some still on the face. Knowing how the front looked like, I asked to see my back with a hand-held mirror and there was the same black ink on my neck. I asked her to please clean the color, she again used soft voice to refuse, ""I can't get rid it. I can't. I can't."" I thought I heard it wrong. When I asked again, she again said, ""I can't do it. I can't. I can't."" Even her co-worker heard her soft argument, and told her, ""Use the color remover."" which was a bottle right on the counter. She reluctantly used it a little bit, but insisted that the ink would go away by itself later, not now. I also softly inquired, ""How would the color go away by itself if I don't do anything?"" She insisted, ""It just would."" I didn't ask anymore. I paid her $45 cash, she didn't bother giving change. Upon my request for a receipt, she gave me one that noted for the additional charge, ""Extra Length Color $10"". Anyone in this world would not call my way above shoulder hair ""long"", let alone ""extra length"". My hair was still dripping wet when I left the store because when I asked her if it could be blow dried a little more, she said it's an extra $10. Conclusions about this place: 1) Dishonest about the coupon offer 2) Took over two hours for the simplest hair dye task 3) Didn't have the skills or concern to take care customers' needs 4) Refused to clean up the dye on customer's face - first time I ever encountered",negative
"The day before Christmas, I took my daughter in to get her hair dyed black. I wasn't thrilled about that idea, but agreed as long as she left a few lighter strands here & there. Well, the lady that did her hair did mostly black, but some spots were blue, some were purple & there was a strange square of an awful brown on the left side of my daughter's head. Not sure why she did that as it doesn't equal streaks of lighter color throughout. ??? I had to put my daughter on a plane the next day to fly to the East coast, so there was no time to fix it. Her stepmother put a box of black on & it looked decent until it started to fade. I took her in not long after for a trim & to see if we could get the color fixed & they said it will have to grow out. She needed a trim last weekend & was REALLY wanting to get her color fixed. The blonde lady that finally helped us said that I should've brought her in the next day! I told her it's probably not a good idea to violate a court order (she was going to visit her father for the holiday). Then she said it was going to cost $80 for the 1st hour & $50 each addtitional hour to try to fix it. I pointed out that THEY were the ones who screwed it up in the first place. She didn't care. NEVER again will those people touch our hair! We will NOT be back!",negative
"Went in for a haircut at 4:00 was taken by Angela at 4:30 and by 5:40 my hair was chopped! I asked for long layers, got nothing layered only uneven, slanted at an angle chopped up hair at the bottom! I asked for bangs after 3 times asking she still didn't do it right! My hair is atrocious & I'm ferrous! Thanks NOT SO FANTASTIC SAMS!!!!!",negative
"I went in there to get my teenagers some haircuts. My son is very particular about his hair and we could never find a person who did his hair to his liking. As I watched Jacqueline cut, actually assess (she didnt even start cutting yet) his hair, I knew she would do a great job. I was right. My son was quite pleased. I was so impressed, I asked her to cut my hair. She even gave me a lavender/mint scalp massage! I am so glad I went there. The lady who cut my daughter's hair did an excellent job as well. We will definitely return from now on. I'm so glad to have found a place with conscientious hairstylists!",positive
"Returned for a haircut and employee #281, sorry forgot the name and that is the only ID on the ticket. Great service from the employee. She talked to me about the cut all the way through. She made sure I was happy with each step. She was very professional and knew what she was doing. I could not be happier and it makes me look good. Love the cut.",positive
"This place is always great. Kristina has been cutting my hair forever (over 5,6 years) and the last couple times she hasn't been there and I still get a good haircut. This time I went in and there was an older blonde lady wearing a Silver dog tag, hair back in a pony tail who was kinda rude & stressed me out she talked about religion. She smelt like cigarettes & kept asking things about my hair that she didn't even end up doing. I told her to keep it long & she wanted to cut an inch off the top... ok I told her I wanted a separation and a hard part, didn't get either.... My hair cut is probably the worst one I've ever gotten from here (still better than some places) but the level of stress and uneasiness I felt just during the entire process was bad. I'm going home and shaving my head. If you go here get anyone but this lady. The rest of the staff is good but I won't e coming back for fear I'll get her again. Sorry Kristina I've been a client of yours for a long time but I can't support a place that employs people like her.",negative
Kris was extremely helpfull she gave me one of my best hair cuts. She was extremely knowledgeable and took her time. Also I must say she was easy on the eyes as well. I recommend this place and ask for kris,positive
"Terrible. Never recommend this place. How does something like this even stay in business? I told the girl what I wanted and it was so butchered I actually asked to have the last of what was left of my hair, shaved down with a number 1 on the trimmers. Not even remotely close to what I asked for. And oh wow...they gave me a discounted rate...after destroying my hair. I paid just so I could leave. Been waiting weeks now so I can go see my regular barber. Never again, do not recommend going here, even of you are trying to save a couple dollars. I was told I would regret it, and I sure do regret going here. I would give zero stars if I could",negative
I've been going here for over two years and Christina has been the best and I always leave satisfied with her service. She is the best!,positive
Extremely disappointed with the result of my haircut. Should've know I would've got this service with a 10 dollar haircut.,negative
Olga does a fabulous job with color and she really understands how to style fine hair! Love my new blonde highlights and she is so helpful with tips and styling products.,positive
Savannah was one of the most personable people that have ever cut my hair. I took a chance booking an appointment somewhere ive never been but the reviews and photos online made me feel this could be a good place and boy was i right. I worked in customer serivce a long time and she is an asset! Thank you!!!,positive
Love this place!! I get my hair done by Olga she is amazing! I am very picky about who I let color/ cut my hair and I completely trust her. I used to have such a hard time getting the exact color I wanted. When she colored it the first time it was perfect.,positive
Thank you Angela for all your work getting us all ready for Haleys Sweet Sixteen. You are amazing. We love the beautiful shop. Seeing Santa was an Extra bonus.,positive
"I went to this salon and my stylist was Casi, she was very nice and did a great job cutting my hair, definitely going back to see her or Bonnie. The salon is quiet and personable",positive
"Love this salon! Great staff, great services! Glad we finally have a decent full service salon in the Indian trail area! Very clean and professional! Second to None!!",positive
"woOoOooOow, they have a great costumer service and the lady's they work over there are so nice to costumer . anyone needs threading eyebrows needs to ask for lily over there she will taker of all u need",positive
"Love going there always do a wonderful job. Will keep going back to these guys any time I need my hair done. The staff is great and always up to the task of giving you the perfect look. Be it color, perms, sets or just a simple cut they can do it! They have just started taking appointments online or over the phone so can now do that to make it easier and quicker. So head over today!",positive
Miss Saundra and miss Maggie are very very nice. It's a little hidden but it's awesome I love what they did to my hair the color stayed very well,positive
I went to this salon for my ayebrows! Lily did it for me! I'd like her personality! She was really perfesional and nice .she fixed my brows and perfect shape I want ! Tnx lily! I definitely come back,positive
"I have been coming to this salon for 23 years now and have never had bad service! I have very thick hair, combined with the medicines I take, makes it very difficult to correctly perm! Maggie, the owner of the salon, always gets my hair just right! Today, I had my hair permed and it came out gorgeous! I can't wait for my husband to see my hair. He will love it! I come here for my hair to be colored and permed and would go nowhere else!",positive
Never ever ever in the history of life should anybody go here my hair was passed my butt i asked for layers around my face and the girl chopped my hair off on the left side of my head i have no layers i had to stop her and walk out with my hair chopped on 1 side i feel so stupid walking around looking like this it embarrassing and its so short it doesnt even go back in a pony tail all i can do is cry when i left .... plz plz plz people dont look for discounts when it comes to your hair just pay the higher price so it can be done by a professional because i feel so ugly right now,negative
"I went there all excited & bought a big package deal. $33 for a haircut, shampoo, style, hot oil deep-conditioning treatment, and gloss. They didn't do deep-conditioning treatment or hot oil which was really disappointing since I was looking to spoil myself by treating my hair. She put one or two spritz of oil in my hair. Plus I had to pay $20 more since my hair was a little longer than shoulder length even though she cut a bunch of it off! I think it's just not worth it!",negative
"I was on groupon and saw something for this salon. I bought it and went. The day i had my appt, one of the girls called in, leaving 2 working. They were super busy but managed to take care of every client that walked in the door, including myself..and they did a beautiful job with my hair. I had sandra and maggie both. They both are experienced and are very friendly. did a great job w.my cut color and highlight!",positive
"I will never go to another hair place in Las Vegas. You cannot beat the prices and quality of hair care. I drive 35 minutes just to go here and it is entirely worth it. I have never had a stylist pay as much attention to what I want and willing to make awesome suggestions before... and for almost half as much as I am used to paying. Shana is a rockstar so I make appointments with her, but they do walk-ins too. I always feel comfortable there. No this isn't some fancy pants salon with new furniture and crazy elite style ambiance so to some it's probably outdated or ugly. But I'm not paying for the aesthetics... I'm paying for my hair to look fabulous, which it always does! They take the extra time and are kind. Service A+. Also, look for groupons, that's how I started here!",positive
"Saw the ad on Groupon seemed like a good deal. Went to get color and highlights and a cut. Great haircut and color services done. The building was a little dated if your a person where that matters and if that does matter it shouldn't the service and friendliness of the staff especially ""JAVONA"" she was the one that styled my hair. She gave great recommendations for me to use when selecting hair product and was very conversational. My husband took me here for me to get a whole new hair do for our anniversary. This was a great gift. JAVONA really knows what she's doing and I highly recommend Fiesta family hair if you live there locally and especially is your visiting. No the place is not on the strip but it is a short drive and will leave a lasting impression of what service is and the quality of color and style of hair that JAVONA does is simply the best in town. If your reading this review stop reading and call JAVONA already and make an appointment.",positive
"I bought a groupon and found fiesta hair. A bit far but totally worth it.Best at everything especially blow dry. I have also had cuts, color and highlights.i love them and my hair is hard to deal with. I love jovanie but everyone there is great and they are good at what they do. If u live in vegas or visiting, do give them a try. U wont be disappointed!",positive
I got my hair done by Danielle on my birthday. I have dry & frizzy hair. She did a fantastic job. It made my day. Thanks Danielle for such wonderful experience.,positive
"Thanks Danielle for the new hairstyle. I needed a change and this is the shortest I have gone in a long time. My haircut is still feminine which I love and I have some versatility in how I will style. I also appreciate the recommendations on product. I am a little apprehensive on creating beach waves but, practice will make perfect. I am thankful Danielle doesn't let me get too impulsive with color, She is aligned with my hair goals. Danielle also never lets me leave with a wet head- my biggest pet peeve in any hair salon. Thanks Danielle!",positive
"Mischa is the best! I used to work with her, she did my hair then and still does now! It's always a pleasure and she is great at what she does... If you want to look great and feel great when you leave go and see Mischa.",positive
"Same as the other reviewer, I've been following my hair stylist Mischa on and off for about 15+ years! What's cool is that a lot of the other stylists there have also been at the same salons as her that are there now. It's always neat, clean and everyone there is very welcoming! :)",positive
"I have been following my stylist around for 15+ years and this is where she currently resides.... This salon was opened and is run by stylists. It is in the same complex as Honey Baked Ham and Hobby Lobby. It is a decent size salon and offers the hometown, shop around the corner where all the ladies go, hair salon feel that is often lacking in a lot of the frilly ""hip"" salons covering the Valley. Don't get me wrong though, this place is clean, well appointed, and modern; definitely a great place to meet your beauty needs! Here is hoping for great success & Happiness amongst clients new and old!!",positive
My tuna was so over-cooked that I couldn't break it apart to try to eat it...sent it back only to wait 45 minutes for a margarita pizza which came out cold - it was quite disappointing. We will not return...,negative
I brought my father here to try to burger and he loved it--they even cut it down the middle so we could share. The sweet potatoe fries were his and my favorite accompanied by what I think was aioli sauce. Overall it was a great dining experience and the vibe/decor was an added bonus. Definitely worth trying if you're in the area.,positive
"Food is great, great atmosphere bartender Kerri does great job. Puts up with our crazy demands and always has a smile on her face...",positive
The mac n cheese was perfect! The burgers were a little over cooked but our server didn't even ask how we wanted them cooked. I'm crazy for toppings on my burger but there is a point when it's too much.,negative
"Note: My opinions are somewhat consistent with other posters below who indicated that they really liked Flipside in the past, however, as of late not so much. I'm officially in that camp now. Went on a Wednesday evening around 6:00 pm. Other than about 7 folks milling around the bar area, there was only one other couple in the whole dining area. I was very shocked - for prime time dining hour. That to me is communicating a message - you who management, you may want to note this. I understand it was Wednesday and it would not be overly crowded, but I expected others besides just one lone couple - at the prime dinner hour. I did note from their beer list that they are about $1- $2 higher on their drafts than most everyone else. I had the Flipside pale ale collaboration with Lucky Owl from Chagrin Falls. Usually when it is your ""house brew"", you price it less than all the others. No so here - $6 which was the same as some others. I had the special - chicken banh mi - $12. Considering they were touting all the different items on the sandwich - slaw, cilantro, aioli, jalepenos, etc. - I was expecting a flavor burst. No such luck. I'd say the sandwich was relatively tasteless. For $12, which is a steep price for a chicken sandwich, it better sing and be very good. This was quite far from it. My dining companions had the ""Say Cheese"" burgers which are essentially $8.50 burgers. No complaints although my wife (who also was a big fan of Flipside) did comment that she recently had a few burgers elsewhere that were better than this. Ordered a plain fry and an order of onion rings. Oddly, these came out before the meal and the girl that brought them out said that our meals are ""right behind this"". Well, they must have got lost because they probably came out, what seemed to be, 10 min. later. Fries and rings were good. I fell in love with the fries previously, but I could say, not with this batch. Note: No where during this time did the waitress come by to check and give us assurance the our meals would be coming. Overall, for what they charge - which is top dollar - the finished product needs to stand out and execute, I could say this was not the case here, at all. I think it will be a vey long while before I give Flipside another chance.",negative
"The Kobe beef corn dogs were awesome and their milkshakes look tasty, but this place is extremely overpriced. $12 for a mediocre burger and at least $6 for most beers. There's nothing unique about this place that sets it apart from the many other burger joints in the Cleveland area.",negative
Great tasting burgers. Nice atmosphere. Good choices for draft beers and knowledgeable staff about their product. I'll be back.,positive
Went to call in a order of a burger and two sides of fries and a salad at 9:30pm 2/20/17 and was told the kitchen was closed .. it says that the hours for tonight for the rocky river location are till 10:00pm I was confused and dumbfounded frankly if I were to of drove all the way there would I have been turned away at the door? That's bad business in my opinion and I feel like the last few times I have gone into this location the wait staff were rude and acted like they really didn't want to be there. I'm deeply saddened by this as the food is amazing but because of this I'm going to have to part ways with this location it's just disappointing. I hope this comment reaches someone who cares because it just seem like no one does.,negative
"Everything we ordered here was fantastic! I would go here again just for the spectacular creme brulee beer! We ordered the Brie burger and brisket mac and cheese and it did not disappoint! The only negative thing was that it was a Friday night and it was completely dead, we thought it was closed!",positive
"Well, if burgers are gonna be your thing you should probably do a better job at it. Ordered the forester burger and a side of truffle fries. Fries were fine, crispy, hot and lots of them. The burger on the other hand...small greasy as hell patty on a basic giant eagle seasame bun with some ""grilled mushrooms"" that were over cooked and basically reheated. The sautéed onion was mushy and like something you would get at a ballpark. No condiments except for aoli with horseradish in it which we all know is just whipped mayo. Soggy single piece of lettuce, 2 pickles and a average Tomato slice. All that for $13? Skip it and hit five guys instead. At least it's relatively fresh and predictable for a good price.",negative
"Delicious, messy burgers- a must try!! Don't forget to try the truffle fries with a side of truffle aioli. Amazing! One of my favorite burger spots in the Cleveland area.",positive
"The concept is great and the original in hudson ohio was awesome but while it started out as a good place with good food, the place has gone waaaaay downhill! I and many others have described how horrible the service has been we tried it one last time tonight after a few bad experiences and odds are we won't be back! The waiter said he knew little about the draft list since they just changed it and he wasn't interested in finding answers to our questions! Friends have talked about how the servers were not attentive at all and my wife mentioned how she called the manager over a few weeks ago about an issue and the manager looked at her and said ""oh sorry about that"" and walked away! A friend told me it's no different from going to McDonalds......just costs a lot more!",negative
"Oh my gosh. So good!! I had to be a plain Jane and get the say cheese burger and it was incredible! I added avocado to it and it was the best seasoned and cooked burger I have ever had. We had the chili cheese fries to share and they were different but so freaking good. To top off our meal, we ordered a chocolate milkshake and they split it between my husband and I without us asking. One of the best milkshakes I've ever had, and that's the truth. I cannot wait to go back soon and try something new!",positive
"Pretty plain food, nothing really stood out to me. If I ever went back I would skip on any of their drinks and just get a burger. There may be some hidden gems on the menu but from what I've experienced it's just OK.",negative
Got the house burger.it reminded me of a school lunch burger.the bun was old the burger was not seasoned and the onion stuff( caramelized?) Was poopy.it came with a condiment which was unique.not in a tasty way.got the fries with cheese.it was edible .my friends got a mushroom gravy on their fries.it was mushroom juice.gross.also had onion rings and they were not seasoned.would not go back wendys is way better.not a joke,negative
"didn't love it as much as i did the first time (in Hudson), but it was still good. this time my burger seemed to be overwhelmed by the bitter taste of the grilled onions and the fries seemed to be the nubs that get left in the fryer basket all night. i liked the physical restaurant more though, to be honest. i think i'd choose it over Hudson for that reason but i may get a different burger next time.",positive
So to say this is my new favorite burger place sounds like an exaggeration since I am a total lover of B Spot but it is. This is our second time here and my second time having the One Red Door Burger. It's the best burger I have EVER had!!!! My hubby had the Chili Pepper Burger. Said it wasn't as spicy as the name implies yet it was delicious!!! Sorry I didn't post pics but the margarita got the better of me! The onion rings are superb and the fries are also good. I would totally recommend this place!!!!,positive
The grouper sandwich is just as good as you can get in Florida!!! Meaty and grilled to perfection!!!!! Flown in fresh.,positive
"Flip Side burgers are the best! We usually go to the location in Hudson. The first time we tried the location in Rocky River, they were super accommodating with trying to get us out of there quickly so we could make our movie. The staff was very helpful and friendly, and the food was delicious.",positive
"Succulent burger but the real star here is the sweet potato fries. Unlike others served everywhere else in this county, these, I believe, are fried and then seasoned with savory herbs. I believe they are fried, perhaps twice, in peanut oil. I thought these were the best prepped and served sweet fries I've ever had, and I've sampled many. Burger very juice, yummy, great quality beef plus very rich and satisfying.",positive
This was our second time at The Flipside. Both times the best burger we have ever had and the best cooked. Our kids even thought it was the best burger. The onion rings were perfectly cooked also. The bartender and our server we excellent too. thanks again.,positive
Had the California Turkey Burger. They are usually bland and dry but no here at Flip Side. The turkey burger was just as good as a regular burger if not better. I will come here again.,positive
"Haven't taken a bite of my food and already know I won't be back. If you're incapable of accommodating to-go orders don't offer them. Was told 25-30 minutes. Got there at 30 minutes then stood there for another 25 minutes because ""a big order came in."" Burgers take 5 minutes to cook, and there's no way these will be good enough for me to come back after this first experience. Might as well update after eating: fries were ice cold, as though they put them in a box when we ordered then forgot they made us wait an hour. Burger was tasteless and my toppings I ordered were missing. I threw half of it away. Seriously, don't bother with this place.",negative
"Nothing less than a five star, wish there was more options! Server, Stephen, hands down out of all the restaurant I go, best server in Cleveland! Everything from the fries to the drinks are perfect! Get in and try everything!",positive
I love this place sooo much. Burgers are phenomenal service is good. The food taste like it was made with love. I will def be goin back serval times a week!! also the chefs are sexy,positive
We both had the Flip Side burger and it was delicious. I didn't like the smell if the metal tables. The service was friendly but not attentive.,negative
The food was ok. I had the bison burger which wasn't great. It needed more flavor. The portobello on it was soaked in vinegar. Someone in my party had the crab cake and it was too salty. The margaritas were too sour and were more like drinking straight lime juice. It was disappointing especially since it was my birthday. The customer service was on point but the food and drink were not. I wanted this place to be awesome. Hopefully they work out the kinks.,negative
"Service was great, burgers were good, onion rings were good, French fries were ok. Cobb salad was good but dressing was just ok. Bloody Mary was horrible, do not order it. Tasted like watered down tomato juice. Very noisy so not the place for a romantic evening.",negative
"Great service, amazing food, wide selection of craft beers and specialty drinks. The food is fresh, made from scratch. Grass fed beef, fresh cut fries, and everything is made to order!",positive
"Their burgers are good.. If your standard is Applebee's or tgif but there's no contest going up against similarly priced local spots like Deagan's, Forage or Lolita. Also, what kind of burger restaurant does not cook their burgers to order?",negative
"I've been getting haircut here for the past year now. Johonny always takes care of me and makes my hair look very clean. Fun, laid back atmosphere with music always playing and sports on tv. Make sure to call and make an appointment if you can because they can get pretty busy quickly. I mean these guys are in the best barbershop in Vegas so I'm not surprised. And try to bring cash if you can! Remember, cash is king!",positive
"Definitely the best barber shop in Vegas in my opinion I've been going to my barber Jose Luis for 8 years never been disappointed with the quality of cut or service and the other barbers in the shop are Masters at their craft also literally can cut all hair textures and styles and for the quality of service you receive the price is excellent cuts starting at $17 with the razor lineup, cut and beard trim starting at $35 I've been to places not mentioning any names where a cut starts at $25 and they don't even line you up with a razor so I recommend Flow Barbershop to any and everyone.",positive
"I was visiting Las Vegas from New York and I follow this guy through Instagram and I went there to the barbershop without appointment and I waiting like 30 to 45 minutes. After that I got the best service, facial, hair cut, beard and everything was done perfect. I like the style of the barber, they are so nice and happy people, of course Latin. I got not complain for my service. I completely recommend this barbershop to everyone. Good customer service and pleasant barbers.",positive
"Amazing job on my hair, Oslen is very friendly, he helped me to get a new design on my hair and I really like it, I 100% recommend this guy and this place",positive
Been getting my haircut once a week from Richy for a good while now. Always does an amazing job. Great attitude and atmosphere here. Highly recommend,positive
"Okay. Let me just say these gentlemen don't speak English very well. And that's fine, except the guy didn't understand me when I told him how to cut my hair. I told him very simply I wanted 2 inches on the top and 1 on the sides. So he shaves me almost bald. Now, this is only the beginning. I go to pay and they want 17 dollars for this haircut which is outrageous. I wanted to pay with my debit card but couldn't because apparently there's only one guy who knows how to work the machine and he wasn't there. So I was forced to use the atm which charges you two bucks to use and pay cash (which I wasn't told, what if I was paying with a credit card?). I could only take 20 out so I did, then proceeded to pay the guy and awaited my change, which, go figure, he didn't have any change. So I just gave him the 20 and left (basically being forced to tip him for a bad haircut.) I wouldn't recommend anyone go here for a haircut, unless you wanna get your hair screwed up and pay more than you should for it.",negative
I'm hair cut here today. And i show them picture about what I want to do but they're cut my hair so short. And when they're cut my hair talking and stop for talk so many time. (I just say good and nothing to say walking out) No next time for me.,negative
"1st time I take my 7 year old to a barber and was not disappointed at all . Drove by this place and read the reviews in google and decided to stop in . They took us as a walk in and the guys are very friendly, great atmosphere and customer service . The price was very reasonable . Camilo did an amazing job, we will be coming back, I recommend",positive
"Scheduled haircut for a specific time just to walk out without a haircut due to s heckled barber still cutting prior guys head 20 min into my scheduled time. It's cool, I just won't go back.",negative
"I was there with my son, with no appt and the owner take care of me and he is do a very nice haircut for my son. I recommend this place to any moms is a nice place, clean and very good customer service and very patience with the kids.",positive
"Was a first time visitor a couple days ago and while the place looks nice, the barber did a sloppy job with my haircut. It was easy to tell he was rushing my cut and after looking in the mirror I realized there were very many mistakes done. Some hairs were noticeably shorter and uneven on the front and sides. I would not recommend this place if you do not like to feel rushed and want a thorough job with your haircut.",negative
"This place was fantastic. It was like walking into a clean and pristine hospital, except to get your hair cut. They were extremely friendly from the very beginning. I could have (and almost did) fall asleep during my cut. Richy did such an amazing job on giving me a fresh cut, that I'm already going to be going back. I honestly can't wait.",positive
Got my Haircut from Pedro the Barber . He was the master Barber indeed. Gave me a Great Pompadour with his master Barber skills will definitely come again and invite my co workers and friends to come to this place everyone always says hello and welcomes everyone greatly . Got the spanish vibe but with great music . Till next time,positive
"Excellent barbers that take their work as serious as family honor. Prices are reasonable for the high quality you get, and everyone very polite. Be warned however, you may go in as a young lad, but you will come out eligible for social security -- i.e. the wait for service is very long. Best to make an appointment.",positive
"Just walked in and got my hair cut by Richy. The shop definitely has strong hispanic/ethnic vibes but white people this place is for you too! I enjoyed the professional atmosphere, nice music, but most of all my result. Richy was very quick and efficient but also took his time to make sure everything was on point. He gave me just what I wanted plus some. You can tell he has artistic pride in what he does. I got such a professional service for such a good price. I will definitely be back!",positive
"My boyfriend and I did a walk in (for him of course) and he saw Pedro, no wait on a Sat AWESOME! His hair cut is perfect",positive
"Awesome barbershop, everything to the clean environment to the professional barbers, they provide excellent advise and always deliver on anything you ask for, and the pricing is fair for anyone.",positive
Woowww came all the way from Manchester England for the fight mayweather mcgreggor thought I'd get my haircut while I was there the week. I'm a barber myself with my own shop. I went here bad bad haircut I told him I wanted a high fade and he done it sooo low and bad didn't even want to cut the top wouldn't show me the haircut with the Mirror and the whole time wouldn't talk a really bad atmosphere just kept talking Spanish to the owner / other barber pair of wankers then tried charging me $40 dollars couldn't advise you anymore sooo bad and so arrogant,negative
"These guys just opened but I've been going to them for almost 10 years, to Jilson, when the owners of this barber shop used to work at Gerardos. They do a great job which is why I've been coming back, and do a better job than any of the higher end places or in the casinos, so I'm always happy to tip them more as its well deserved. Definitely check these guys out, they're honestly some of the best guys in town.",positive
"Richy the barber is the best barber in Las Vegas, never had a problem with him and I have been cutting my hair with him for many years . He is very professional, friendly environment, clean restrooms, clean floors & I definitely recommend if you are in Vegas and in need of quick haircut you won't regret .",positive
"I've been getting my hair cut by Johnny for over 10 years now. I am glad that he moved to this location along wit Ricky and Jilson. The 3 of them are master barbers. At one point or another I have gotten my haircut by both Rick and Jilson, when my barber is on vacation. I always feel confident of both of them. I do not have to worry about the quality of haircut, because they know how to do any stile out there. I love this new location, everything looks amazing and clean. I've been to a lot of barber shops, because I travel a lot and t is the first barber shop that I've been to that has Wifi, AWESOME!!! I highly recommend this location to everyone in between kids to seniors. Remember to book an appointment to get top notch service, because the 3 of them are mostly solid booked. I've never had a problem with my appointments, they always begin on time. Thanks for the exceptional service provided to me throughout the year. I wish the 3 of you success for a life time.",positive
"Great shop! Very clean and excellent haircut received. The service was prompt I just walked in and got right in. Haircut is very clean and the barber took his time to ensure the perfect cut. I am not from the area, but wish there was a shop this nice in my hometown.",positive
I called and asked when I could come they said you could come now and then I ended up waiting for like an hour and a half even though I asked him if I could come in the back and the attitude that was given to me and I was really really unprofessional,negative
Great new barber shop right across the street from the Palms casino!! Ritchie is a great barber! He spent 20-30 minutes cutting my hair. Most places try to rush you through a cut. Flow Barber is very clean and open. I highly recommend this new barber shop to both locals and visitors!!,positive
Best barber I ever been did my haircut exactly how I ask for it nice place very clean happy I found this barber won't change it,positive
new clean shop. I've been getting cut by Richie the owner for 2 years. He's been very consistent with his work and now has a new shop. If you want a quality cut check him out at flow barber.,positive
"A true artist in his craft. Precision and (Honestly overworked). Been going to him for the past 8 years. Hands down one of the finest barbers. Single edge blades, meticulous craftsmanship. You will never put on a hat once you get a haircut from him!",positive
Ally is incredible! I showed her a picture of the hair style and color I wanted and she nailed it! Will definitely be going to Ally from here on out!,positive
"Terrible! I looked better before I went here. Wasted my time and my money and my mom's time watching my kids while I splurged on getting my hair done once a year. Spent 5 hours as she screwed it up then tried to fix it and turned it a weird blue green color. I cried the whole long drive home to walk in the door and everyone look at me sideways. Ally did offer to fix it but I don't trust her touching my head not to mention the time and inconvenience to get a babysitter and all. No, I cut fried hair off myself and put box color on it to cover it. The blue-green still shows but it's not as obvious. I'll wait a month and die it again, I don't want to kill it. What a catastrophe!",negative
I love this salon!! And Sherry Fredell is the best hairstylist you could ever find!!!! I always leave with a smile on my face!!! The salon it's self is extremely clean and every staff member is very nice and professional,positive
"Absolutely love this salon! Excellent service and exceptional care! I go to Effie Nickols at this salon and I am always happy with the service and her excellent skills! Wonderful salon, wonderful service and it always results in wonderful hair! You should go see her!",positive
"This place used to be pretty good (indeed, my entire family went here) until a new owner took control recently. Since then, some of the better staff have left, stylists randomly cancel at the last minute, and the owner herself is not the easiest or most pleasant to deal with on the phone. Although my family had been going here for years, we moved to another salon. As well - parking is scare and a hassle here. When the salon used to be good, we put up with it. Once the salon went downhill and the owner/ stylists became indifferent - why bother?",negative
"Gaston did highlights on my hair. He always does an amazing job! On time, friendly, relaxed, and great. Will be coming back.",positive
"Gastón never seems to fail me! Love, love my new hair cut and style. Very easy to talk to and very easy accommodating and informative with your hair and products. I will forever be his client! Thx Gastón!",positive
Wonderful!The cut and style were magnificent! The experience and knowledge were above and beyond. Showed me how to truly care for my hair and style it to get the look I want. Thanks for helping me feel beautiful again.,positive
"I went to Gastón today after reading all the wonderful reviews and was not disappointed. I showed different pictures and we discussed what I liked about each haircut and how to adapt to my thick coarse hair texture. Gastón took the time before we started to make sure I was comfortable with our direction. I loved the cut, but what was more important to me was the ease I felt with Gastón cutting and styling my hair and that I thoroughly enjoyed myself today. I have already scheduled my follow-up appointment in 6 weeks. Thank you.",positive
I went in today for a consultation and ultimately stayed for a new haircut. My hair is very fine and was in need of some help. I found Gaston extremely honest and full of great knowledge and suggestions. I love my new hair style and will be going back for a color! Thank you!,positive
Gaston was wonderful! You can tell he knows how to cut hair and what looks good on you plus a lot of helpful tips with taking care of your hair. He was honest with me about my hair and I respect that. My hair was a mess trying to grow out a bad perm. In the end I think it surprised him on how well it turned out and I really like it! Plus every friend or family member have said they love it. I couldn't be more happy with my hair. Very happy customer!,positive
"No one in the Valley can create magic the way that Gaston does. I wanted to let my hair 'go natural' to bring back a healthy look but didn't want my roots to show in the process. He stopped coloring it and just with semi-permanent highlights and lowlights, I no longer have to worry about my roots showing. And my hair is healthy again. On top of it all, I look forward to my chats with him! He's charming and has a fab sense of humor.",positive
"I had my first appointment with Gaston today and it certainly will not be the last. I was so impressed with the level of customer service and quality service I received today. I loved the way Gaston gave his opinion on cut choices and coloring. You can tell he is extremely knowledgeable, has his finger on the pulse of the latest trends and is very passionate about what he does. This is the first time I have ever felt a true artist has worked on my hair. I have already booked my next appointment and suggest you do the same!",positive
"If you are looking for a good hairstylist who can do the perfect job for your request of beautiful color and also teaching you how to take care of new color at the same time, here is the right place you should go for. I love my new green color and I have follow his instructions to take care my new color. Now already more than 2 weeks after I have my lovely green hair, and the color is still looks the same as the day when I just got it.",positive
"Just moved from out of state, and found Gaston on yelp after a search of a specific line I have been using on my fashion color hair he was listed as carrying it. He was able to get me in for an appointment within that week at a convenient time that worked for me. When I got there before he started he took the time to get to know me, my hair history and things I liked and didn't like so that he could get me exactly was I was looking for. He also went over the products I need and things to stay away from due to the fashion color and it tending to wash out fast- but really making sure I understood for when I bought them from a store, so I didn't feel pressured to just buy what he had in his salon. (Although he does offer lots of great products also). So the aspect of him not pushing them on me was pleasantly different from previous experiences at other salons. To top it off- his prices were fantastic- and his experience and knowledge made the difference with me for sure. You can tell he absolutely loves what he does and is very passionate. I have never had so many compliments on my hair as I have since my hair was done with Gaston. I recommend him to everyone I meet!",positive
"Gastón is the stylist I've been searching for since I left San Francisco last year. The West Valley is a sea of Supercuts and trimmers, and I feared I'd never be able to find a stylist that worked on men's hair at this level of professionalism and quality. I gave Gastón a vague idea of what I wanted to do with my hair, and within minutes we were able to nail down a plan for growth and styling for the next 6 months. And he nailed the cut. I haven't looked this good in over a year. Now *that's* what I'm talking about.",positive
He is amazing! I have naturally curly hair so my color lifts a bit differently since it tends to be so dry. I have been to many hair stylists trying to find someone who can do my hair. Gaston is an hour away from me but worth the drive!!! I 100% recommend him!,positive
"I came to see Gaston after reading such wonderful things about him! I am thrilled with his fresh salon, his excellent customer service, his comfortable comprehensive lengthy color consultation and I am excited to see what fun things he has planned for my hair! I look forward to a new relationship with this awesome artist!!",positive
"I am editing this review because apparently Yelp didn't push through a response to me until a little while ago. I see the response was sent soon after I sent in my request but I didn't have anything in my messages until about 30 minutes ago so I've kicked up my review to 4 stars and will edit more after making an appointment cheers and I am excited since all the reviews are such raves. It said response time within an hour, for requesting an appointment, it's been well over an hour. Pushing 2 and nothing. Quite disappointing considering the rave reviews. I guess it can no longer say 100% response. I even double checked the hours of operation on Yelp. I'd understand if they said closed today but it states they are open. Ah well the hunt continues.",positive
"Took my daughter to get her hair dyed and cut, he did an amazing job better than what we expected. Not only did he do a great job but gave us advice on how to maintain and care for her hair. He is amazing and a true professional, and I highly recommend him",positive
"I just left and had to leave a review! This was by far the most amazing hair experience I have yet to have! He was very nice and attentive, and he helped me better understand my hair type. He also informed me on how to care for my hair which most hairstylists don't do. He took the time and was a doll! I will definitely be returning!",positive
"I have been enhancing my color for over 20 years. As an active-duty military member it's very hard to get somebody that understands your wants along with making you look beautiful. He is Very talented with the red color. Gaston was an amazing experience. Also, he took a good amount of time consulting with me and made sure that I understood the process and that I felt comfortable with what he was going to do. His products not only smell amazing but feel amazing. I know I'm in good hands now. I have found my stylist.",positive
"Congratulations on finding this review. Gaston is a quintessential hair expert. The man is a haircut, style and color virtuoso. If you landed here, look no further. You found a GEM. Managing hair color, with so much grey coming into the front only, is no easy undertaking. I had my hair bleached from black, at another salon. But, I was only half way there. My hair was four colors when I walked in! He listened to me, sat down and combed through pictures I brought in, and then spent FIVE HOURS correcting the color of my hair. He took my hair past the home plate!! Its a BEAUTIFUL strawberry blonde!!!!!!!! I won't go to another stylist after finding this needle in a hay stack. Enjoy the personalized attention you'll get from Gaston in his own Sola salon. No traffic. No listening to other people's drama. Just you, Gaston, and your imagination. He'll bring your vision to life. Thank you Yelp and thank you Gaston!!!",positive
"I have always gone to the same person to do my hair for over 10 years, but she is in Minnesota and I couldn't keep up going back there. So I decided to see gaston since he had great reviews. Well they were so spot on!! He was so fantastic and knew exactly what I needed. I definitely found my new hairstylist because I'll be going back!! Thank you!",positive
Thank you so much for the excellent haircut and style. Wow!! Gaston is as good of a listener as he is informative. He took the time to transform my hair to even better than I wished for. Gaston was also sensitive and flexible to my medical issues. Superb!,positive
Janair is amazing! I am so glad I have finally found her after trying many hairstylists in the valley. She listens and delivers the exact look as explained. She is great at what she does! Highly recommend,positive
"Let me just say I have been here in Scottsdale for a little over a year, and this is by far one the best experiences I've had. Janair really has her clients best interest at heart.",positive
I think I found my new hair stylist in Scottsdale! Janair is amazing. Thank you for fitting me in with such short notice.,positive
"I went almost 2 years looking a mess after moving to Scottsdale from the east coast (stylist trust issues) I found Janair through Yelp all great reviews so I reached out... a few texts and a phone call and I knew she was the one for me :) She offered to fit me in the next day! She was welcoming and at the end, I looked and felt like myself again. I won't be going anywhere else as long as I live in Scottsdale",positive
Absolutely love coming to Janair for my beautiful beach blonde highlights! She does an amazing job every time and I love coming here.,positive
"I moved to Phoenix about a year ago(nov. 2016) and found Janair shortly after, via a friend's recommendation. I'm very OCD when it comes to my hair, however, Janair took time to consult on my hair prior to styling and does a great job. She continues to exceed my expectations. I trust her with all my hair needs. Whether it is a wash and style, extensions/fill-ins, cuts, blowouts or color. She is professional, talented and punctual. I Highly recommend this salon.",positive
"I had a lot of hair cuts in my day, and let me tell you, Janair at Glitter N Bliss provided the best experience I've ever had! It's a cute, stylish, and clean salon in a very convenient N. Scottsdale location. After I had a horrible experience from a previous hair salon, I was struggling to find a good place I can trust. I came across Glitter N Bliss through Yelp and after reading all good reviews I thought I'd give it a try. I'm glad I did! Janair got me in the same day, she colored, cut and styled my hair and I absolutely love it! Hands down the best!! Janair has spent years perfecting her craft and it shows. If you are on the hunt for a hair stylist, go to Glitter N Bliss and it will be the best decision of your life!!",positive
"FABULOUS...........that is Janair. She definitely knows hair for health, a cut, or color, she is well versed. And, she listens to what you want and helps with her expertise input. She does a super great job, as I've been to many stylist, and she got my cut and color right the very first time working with me. She is also fun to interact with and very very reasonably priced! I'm so glad I found Janair and would recommend her to anyone!!!!!",positive
"Janair has blessed my hair for the past 3yrs. We've done color, cuts, braids, dreads, etc. I trust her with my life LOL great stylist!! We both have the same vision and always makes me feel comfortable. Even though I've moved out of state, every time I come back, she's my first stop!",positive
"Janair is the definition of fabulous. She listens, and actually takes the time to get it right. When I'm in her chair I never have to worry about the end result. My hair is straight and fine, very susceptible to heat and humidity levels. Most stylists breeze through with a quick cut and send me on my way. Janair makes sure that my cut frames my face and works well with my hair type. She is a top-notch stylist, not to mention she is always ready to greet with a smile. Love this girl!",positive
"Janair is absolutely wonderful. She has a great eye for how to accentuate your face and personality with awesome cuts and color. She has done my hair from long and brown, to crazy reds, to chopping it all off for donation and now I rock my pixie cut with style. She has great pricing and is very flexible to work with, I am very grateful I found her!",positive
"I have been living in Phoenix for three years and could never find anyone to cut my hair until now! Janair did such an amazing job on my out of control hair. She is also great to talk to while you're getting your hair done, time flies by. Unlike regular salons, Janair really cares about making sure that your hair cut is something that you love, even if it takes extra time to do. I walked out of their feeling like I was ready for my Vidal Sassoon commercial.",positive
"Janair was fabulous! I went in for a hair cut and got so much more. She gave me a head massage, washed my hair, used a deep conditioner, cut it, blew it dry and even put a few curls in it after. Typically when I ask the stylist to keep my hair long they don't listen, but she removed the dead ends and left me with my length. 100% recommend Janair!",positive
"Long long wait, probably worth paying extra to make an apt. Very cute place, very busy. Had to do some adjustments to my son's hair cut but overall got what we wanted.",positive
A great place to get a cut. If you are in need of a cut this is the place to go. I know when I come into Vegas I will be coming here. Might even come just for this place.,positive
My boyfriend is so picky but Bryce did AMAZING! He said this was the best haircut he's ever had. Combovers can be messed up so easily and he took his time and did an outstanding job!,positive
Take my 15yr old son here to see Chops. Always friendly and he does a great job. Awesome decor. My son refuses to have anyone else touch his hair.,positive
"Wait wasn't long, it depends on the time of day. Barber took his time came out with a great cut. Forgot the barbers name just know he had a face tattoo.",positive
"I loved how Rob cut my hair last time I was here so I I came back. Sadly Rob was not there but I figure ""they have good review the other guys must be as good at Rob"" so I stayed. I wrote my name on the list and waited, and waited, and waited. I kept seen two barbers just playing with their phones (I get that they were probably on their breaks) but I don't know that because no one even talk to me. the only interaction was when one of them ask me is I was a walk in. I'm a patient person if they had taken the time to tell me that i was going to have to wait because they need to take a break i would have understood and waited even longer. The lack of costumer service was off putting so I left.",negative
"Bryce is one talented barber! Cleanest fade ever. Fun True barbershop, funny conversation, friendly staff, and just a cool overall atmospheres",positive
"Best barber shop in town, hands down. Phenomenal skills, good prices, convenient scheduling, and a really, really good sound track. Chop cuts my hair, and he will be as long as he's in the business.",positive
"Moy was reccommended by my little brother a few years ago.. i was a bit iffy at first because he was at a barbershop school & you know, just learning. after my baby got off that chair, i knew i found my kids' barber for lifeeee. after he graduated he ventured off and you better bet your ass i made sure i followed him. he's wonderful at what he does and does it with great precision. ask for Moy & thank me later.",positive
"I went to check out this barbershop. This place was welcoming it had a good feeling, when you walk in its's not a hostile environment like some of these shops where you go and the barbers look like they have a stick up there asses. The guy who shaved me was quick but well done. I would definitely recommend this place.",positive
"I'd spent four weeks growing out a hobo beard and needed to get it under control. I made an appointment with Bryce and explained what I wanted and he knocked it out of the park. I've been to places where they consider what they do as an ""art"" and they couldn't hold a candle to him. Highly recommend.",positive
"Great cut. No same day appointments, so I just walked in. Got seated right away and got a great cut! This is no in/out barbershop. I was in the seat 30+ mins and they take their time to make it perfect... all the way down to the straight razor around the ears and neckline. $15 for active military! Will be back for sure in a few weeks.",positive
"I was in Vegas on a week-long vacation and realized my hair was in desperate need of a shave. Three of us walked in with no appointments - it took about 2.5 hours for all of us to be seen, but it was worth it in the end. Pros: Willing to take walk-ins Walked my partner through the hair cut AC was rolling Hair cuts all came out really well Cons: - We weren't given any time window, and to be honest, it wasn't made clear to me whether or not I'd get a cut. Two barbers were available almost immediately for my partner and brother, but the barber who sent them back said that they ""probably didn't have time for a third"". I sat there for about an hour waiting to figure out if I'd get a cut. - The barber who cut my brother's hair actually cut my brother's scalp while doing a hard line. Not cool. If in Vegas and in need of a cut, I'd probably go back.",positive
"been going to goodtimes every week for almost a earn now because Caleb has been cutting me for years & week in and week out he kills it. I'll hop in the chair & he knows exactly what i want every single time. You gotta love the vibes goodtimes gives off too, makes the overall experience that much better, whether it be the music choice of the day, the movies they play on the flat screens or just the talk in general. stop in you'll have a good time",positive
While vacationing in Vegas I decided to get a cut. So I googled away and came across Goodtimes Barbershop! This place is LEGIT AS F... well you know. Their whole crew there is awesome. Walk ins are welcome but make that appointment if you're going on the weekend and stick to it. Don't be a D-bag. Don't forget to tip cuz you're going to LOVE YOUR CUT!,positive
"Damn, where to begin. This is hands down the best shop in Vegas. First off their crew is extremely friendly and professional. They make you feel welcome right when you walk in the door. The shop is gorgeous, amazing art everywhere! Bryce especially kicks ass. I've been here a few times already and have no reason to ever go anywhere else to get my beard trimmed. Thanks a lot guys! I'll be sending everyone your way!",positive
"I just moved back to town a few weeks ago and was looking for a new barber, read some reviews on this shop and couldn't pass it up. Made an appointment with Caleb and the dude absolutely is a seasoned vet on the clippers. Gave him a quick rundown on what I was looking for and he went beyond expectations, best cut I've had in ages. If you have a beard, Caleb will have it on point before you leave. Def gonna be an every 2 week customer!",positive
"Okay, honestly... First time growing beard and wanted to get lined up to where beard still is growing but edges are clean. How is that hard to understand? I decided to get haircut as well just because I wanted to be uniform with the edges... I explain to him one side of face grows thicker and faster than other side and wanted to make look even. So he trims down my whole beard. Does a little shaving cream twice around whole face, wraps me up in hot towel, then more shaving cream. Touches three spots fast with shaver, puts more substance on, rewraps me up in towel. Cleans off n hands me mirror. Mustache crooked, one side of goat tee is thick, one side thin. One side of chin was high one was low. Smh... Asked for him to make even n he tells me I have a bald spot... So I replied then bring other side down to make even... Told him cool when he hands me mirror, I just wanted to get the hell outta there. Had me sitting in a chair one step from bathroom. Neck on fire, he tells me $40!!!! Felt bad somehow for him and even gave him $45... Walked out feeling ashamed and ripped off. Won't go back.",negative
"No good times here, just a rip off by some clowns that pose as barbers and they were empty when I walked in. They quote me price of $40 on phone 15 minutes ago for haircut and shave, I go there and magically the price increased 25% to $50 in 15 minutes. That's absurd inflation, or a simple bait and switch. I'm not buying drugs in a prison or à used car, just want what I was promised over phone, a haircut and shave for $40. I guess you have to struggle to find a decent and honest barber in this desert when it's over 100 degrees. Never had this happen before. Avoid, shady, no ethics or morals, dishonest scam artists that lie. Their hair cutting ability is as incompetent as their pricing and scam bait and switch techniques. Go somewhere honest, not this place. It's gross & staff is incompetent, raised in a barn with no manners & more importantly trying to rob you aka dishonest. It's simply rude & inconsiderate to waste someone's time and do classic bait & switch lying. Get your act together.",negative
I drove by a few times and was immediately attracted by the old school look that this place had. The barbers are true professionals and greet and treat their customers w a lot of dignity and respect! Impeccable fades and solid service.,positive
My brother in law wanted a clean shave and for the his groomsmen to look good before the wedding. I was tasked with finding a barbershop while in Vegas. I found Goodtimes while searching through Yelp. I called 2 weeks ahead of time to set up an appointment for 8 guys. It turned out to only be 5 that showed up. However when I got there we had to wait like we didn't have appointments. I was a little upset but their work speaks for itself. All of the guys except me have never been to a barbershop before and they all walked out telling me how happy they were with the job Goodtimes did and that they now need to start going to barbershops. The overall experience was great but I think they need to work on their book keeping when it comes to appointments.,positive
"Third appointment at good times barber shop, Enzio did a great job on the beard and hair cut. The only barber shop I will ever go to!",positive
"I went to many barbers around the city before, the guys here are very professional, the place is great, and the best costumer service I ever had in a barbershop,from all of them, if you are in vegas check it out, thanks the great job",positive
"I have a girl who cuts my hair and keeps it up well but her beard game is pretty crap. So I decided even though its a trip I gotta try this shop because the pics are amazing, price is good, and they carry some great pomades. I managed to get a same day appointment with Caleb. Holy balls my beard looks better than I even thought it could. It's perfectly shaped and cleaned up, the shop was clean and smelled great, and Caleb's beard game is strong. I'll be back like the damn terminator.",positive
"Was on vacation from San Jose and needed a good cut. I noticed Goodtimes on yelp and gave them a call at 9:30am hoping they could get me in for an appt. They were able to get me an appt at 11:00am with Caleb. Took an uber from the strip and right when I walked in I noticed the classic feel of the shop with the sailor jerry bottles on the wall lol. Coming from San Jose and the amount of great barbershops they have, Caleb barber skills were on point!! Great with the razor and a professional with the scissors. Took his time and told me the reason he cut my hair a certain way. I HIGHLY recommend anyone from out of town to head to goodtimes barbershop.",positive
Great barbershop!! when I moved out from LA I was unsure if i can find a new barber. But Chops does not disappoint when it comes to a clean cut. Been following them for a while and this new location is perfect!! We'll be back always for sure!,positive
I'm new to the whole Beard thing and I heard great things about this place from Mike Minor so I had to check it out.... Caleb was my Barber and I couldn't have been happier. Caleb is great and I recomend him and Good Times as your go to Barber Shop. Beyond Clean Super Nice Staff. I did a walk in and was lucky this place is a Jewel and an Appointment would be recommended.,positive
"Chops is my barber and I can honestly say he's the best in town!!! I take my father every 2 weeks to see chops as he can not drive himself and it is the highlight of his 2 weeks forsure. There is no better place in town to get a cut. Chops, Moy, Chris, Allan and Caleb thank you so much!!!",positive
"I decided to try this place and it was a great decision. I love that old fashion and modern barbershop really cool. My barber was Caleb, he did a great job on my comb over best one I had. Cool chilled guy. Need a good place for a cut this place is it!",positive
"Just had my hair cut and beard trimmed by Chops. I won't be going anywhere else!!! Such a nice guy!! It was more like a conversation with a friend, with a few interruptions about my hair, than a haircut. Then I got the hot towel treatment, I love the hot towels! I missed the shave though. It must have happened because my neck and cheeks are trimmed perfectly. I just never felt the razor!! Not only do I look like a million, I feel like a million!",positive
"This is a very old review and long overdue. Hopefully things have changed. Not only did I get a terrible haircut with grossly uneven sides, etc, but I explicitly asked for a ""men's"" haircut. The same tools were used, the same style of cut was given, but they charged the ""women's"" rate. In many places in North America, such as NYC, this is illegal. Not only because it's overcharging, but because it's discriminatory on the basis of gender. Simply because they thought I looked like a woman, regardless of my gender identity or the service performed, I was charged more. Human rights council of Ontario would have pursued this, FYI Grateful Head. Hopefully you've chosen a more progressive pricing structure, not to mention more worthwhile stylists.",negative
"This was my first time at the grateful head, after a few different friends had recommended the salon to me. I have to say I was very impressed! I didn't have an appointment but had time to kill and decided to see if they had room for a cut. I was taken to a chair right away, and my stylist's name was Katie. She took her time and listened to what I wanted, yet wasn't afraid to give her own input, which I really appreciate in a stylist. She cleaned up my bob beautifully, which I like blunt with some very slight layering in the back. I am extremely happy with her work and will definitely be returning. My only reason for not giving the full 5 stars is that it is quite expensive. The decor and ambiance is great and my coffee was hot and strong! Definitely recommend.",positive
Nice place I really dig the decor and all around ambiance of the place. I booked with Matthew for colour and trim and happy with the results. He got rite to work extremely time efficient and nice job overall. Rates were decent also. I will definitely be back!,positive
Had an amazing cut and pin-up style from Dana! Will absolutely be going back to see her! It's obvious that Dana has exceptional skills and experience. The staff is really nice and the salon has a great vibe and great music. Just make sure to get to the area early as finding parking can be tricky! Thanks x,positive
"Great salon! This was my first time at Grateful Head and I left very happy, my hair looked beautiful. I had a cut with Earl, and colour with Dana. Lysa was very helpful and answered all my questions via email, prior to the visit. What I was trying to achieve with my hair: last November I put a semi-permanent medium brown/auburn, it mostly washed out over the winter, but the stubborn copper stayed and it didn't suit my complexion at all. My natural colour is a dark golden blonde with an ash base. I really wanted my natural colour back, with a few higlights for a bit of brightness, without the damage, as I'm trying to grow out my hair a little longer. Dana really understood what I was looking for, and we did very natural 'sun-kissed' babylights and toner (few minutes at the sink). Dana was keeping an eye on the highlights as my hair is very fine, and also noticed that my colour lifted very quickly, which was awesome, so we didn't need to leave in it longer than necessary=no damage. The baby lights looked so nice that I decided to add on a tiny bit more a week later. It was perfect. And I'm glad we took it slowly as I wanted to make sure it was what I wanted. The cut that Earl did was stunning, he's amazing, it suits my face shape perfectly, and since I let my hair air dry, the cut works with that. I keep my hair mostly all the same length (for more volume), and with this cut, it looks even fuller and brings out the natural wave, which I love. I'm super happy I went to Grateful Head.",positive
"I have had my hair bleached a couple times, once before recently dying it mint. I originally wanted to get another bleach and do a light blonde with dyed roots, but the stylist Nicole discouraged belaching it for a third time (erring on the side of caution). She helped me find a good solution to my problem during the consultation- we decided to do an ombre (top half close to my natural colour) and simply tone the ends. She trimmed my ends and shaved down my undercut, and it ended up being much more inexpensive than I had anticipated. It looks great and I am really happy!",positive
"Perfection! Such a lovely and unique place, and they cut my curly hair beautifully each time. It was a great day when this salon opened on Roncesvalles, and the Dundas location is so beautiful in such a different way. Yes, it costs money, but it's worth it! Support this local business by checking them out (especially if you have curly hair: ask for Stacy!)",positive
"Not impressed. $270 later I barely got a trim and my requested colour process (balayage // sombre) turned out super red and brassy and nothing like I requested. In the stylists defence, he did offer to fix it but had just previously defended his work and argued with me that there was no red in my hair whatsoever. Went out on a limb to try a new place. Regret it.",negative
"Just had my hair cut by Paul Shepherd for the first time last week. I am impressed. All the odds were totally stacked against him: I have annoying hair (frizzy, wavy, with weird unruly curls in weird place); I am growing out a pixie cut; I am not very good at explaining what I want and I don't do high maintenance styling. He figured out what was bothering me and fixed it perfectly- giving me a haircut that works with my hair, my face, the shape of my head, my styling capabilities (i.e. zero). Highly recommended. (It's not a five because it is quite expensive, but, then again, good things do cost money)",positive
"While, people seem to be giving Stacy positive reviews, I did not see her. If I had, perhaps my review would be more positive. A young man cut my hair, and I don't remember his name. If I did, I probably wouldn't write it here because I'm not that mean. I'll just say that this place is highly overrated, OVERPRICED, and just a rip off. Also, the staff didn't know about new hair trends, and tried to make me feel stupid for requesting one. The person who washed my hair, gave me the WORST hair wash I have ever received in my life. The was no pressure added at all, and my hair felt dirty and flat afterwards. It was a huge disappointment because I normally look forward to getting my hair washed and getting a head massage. The cut I received was out-dated, unflattering, and uneven, and the stylist was just insecure. The atmosphere was kind of cool, and rock inspired, but nothing to rave about, and not a reason to come here. You should be coming here for a good haircut. I'm sorry, but for almost 100 $, for a simple hair cut, I deserve a great haircut and much better service. I do not recommend this place and will not be returning.",negative
"Best salon in the city hands down. The vibe is great, the staff are welcoming and the stylists are super talented. I've had my hair cut by Stacy Stray many times there and every time it looks perfect. Highly recommended!",positive
"Very prompt with appointments... I have NEVER waited for an appointment and I've been there over a dozen times. Cost for colour and cut is on par with similar salons elsewhere. I highly recommend Stacy Fitz. She is great girl to chat with who does a fantastic job cutting hair. Hope she never leaves! Let me just say that reception is a pain ... Phone tag is kind of the usual way I have to make an appointment. Despite that annoyance, reception is very friendly.",positive
"Called this salon this morning because I couldn't take my hair anymore and was given an appointment 45 mins later. I didn't want to spend a lot, so I asked for a junior stylist. Got there and met Nicole, and our consultation went great. Showed her some pinterest shots and she totally got it. 1 hour later, and after a very careful check, dry and straighten, Nicole was done and I was really very pleased. She got what I was after and gave me a great cut. I'd recommend Nicole to anyone - she's got talent! Thanks Nicole for a great cut!",positive
"I've gone to Grateful Head for almost two years now. I've seen many of the stylists there and I've always walked out with a great colour and cut. I have fine, curly hair. For years I only went to salons that focussed on curly hair, but I got very bored and I rarely ended up with anything interesting. Since Matthew started at GH a year ago, I've gone to him exclusively. He is a true professional. My colour always looks fabulous, and he manages to cut my hair EXACTLY how I want it. He's not afraid trying different things with my hair, but will also be honest if he thinks that something might not work out. I appreciate that. He's also a lot of fun and has a great sense of humour. Matthew also cut my 7 year old daughter's hair on her birthday and she was delighted with the results (no more Melonheads for her!). Highly recommended. I am always getting complimented on my hair.",positive
$50 for a junior stylist seems more than reasonable for a woman's cut. Margot gently coaxed me to cut of my colour damaged ends. She also provided me tips on styling that didn't involve an up-sell of a styling product. Thanks Margot.,positive
"The Good: For a place that looks like it's all about cool -- the distressed wallpaper, chandeliers, a certain amount of Gothic splendour -- the staff are very friendly, cheerful and helpful. Coffee or tea as soon as you sit down (and maybe a glass of wine if you've been there a few times) doesn't hurt. Generally, my haircuts have been great, and that's with a head of fairly unruly wavy hair. I've also brought my kids there and they love the stylists and have received great cuts. Great products too. The Slightly-Less Good: If you're a boy, make sure to ask for one of the stylists that likes working on men's hair. The one less-than-perfect cut I got was when I was pressed for time, couldn't get one of the great men's-hair stylists and took a flyer on someone else. My fault for bad time management more than theirs.",positive
"I'll get it out of the way right off the bat - you're going to cash out at Grateful Head. But when you are plied with wine, coffee, smiles, and get to hang out in a beautiful space with an all-around upbeat, warm, and professional vibe, all I can say is that you get what you pay for. I am a very sheepish salon-goer by nature--I get intimidated easily by frosty stylists and am terrible at articulating exactly what I want, but Stacey worked with my super thick hair and gave me a maintenance-free cropped cut that not only doesn't look like a mushroomy lampshade, but looks extremely youthful, fun, and chic. This is exactly the cut I wanted, but better, and I didn't have to climb a mountain to get my needs across. I came on a superior recommendation from a friend but was still expecting to part with my curtain of hair and leave in an extremely bad mood, feeling strange and used (I've been the victim of a few unsanctioned surprise 'experiments' at the hands of some overzealous stylists hell bent on making me look as unprofessional as possible). That was not the case. Stacey made great product recommendations and I even purchased an amazing finishing spray--something I'd never do. Maybe it was the wine? The Hank Williams tunes playing softly somewhere in the distance? The glittering smiles and tattooed bodies? I think I found my salon.",positive
"Cool ambience, awesome music, beautiful people... all they need to do now is learn how to cut hair and they will really be on to something. My experience: I called on a Monday to make a Tuesday appointment. I asked for a ""senior stylist"" as they have on their menu. The other choices being the ""creative stylist"" or ""new talent"". There is a $15 difference here, for men's cuts. I was told I'd get Katie, who had been working there for three years. Everyone was nice and friendly when I arrived and there is no doubt to the vibe of this place, there's an energy there. I asked for a trim on the sides and short on the top but enough to be able to play around and keep it messy. I was told my hair wasn't long enough to do that. I haven't had a haircut in nearly three months...! We settled on trimming the sides and just cleaning up the top. Using scissors only (as I requested) she managed to cut my hair on the side to almost the skin... on one side. The other side was trimmed actually not too bad save for the raised patches here and there. She barely touched the top so the end result was a very 90's looking hairstyle. When she showed me the back, my hairline at the bottom looked totally crooked so I figured it must be me seeing it wrong. She blow dried it and styled it a bit and in the lights and mirrors there, it looked okay. When I got home and showered, upon further investigation, there was no fade from the side of my head to the top, just clumps and indeed the bottom line at the back was on an angle. I basically had a crooked bad bowl cut. The part that really gets me is that this woman is 22 years old. How does that qualify her to be a senior stylist? I guess the ""new talent"" come in to see their clients during recess! They really have a lot of nerve charging the money they do for such inexperienced stylists who clearly have no idea what they are doing. I guess she earns that for dressing up like Betti Page? I ended up getting my hair fixed elsewhere for half the price, I didn't trust them enough to ever touch my ungrateful head ever again.",negative
"I tried this salon for the first time and was hoping that they would do a good job. The stylist I had was Stacy Stray. He kind of did a bad job at it and I have to say I won't be back here again. As for the service at reception...it was really messy and unattentive. It seemed like they were having an event or something at the salon and didn't have the patience for customers. At the same time, I had to wait over 20 mins for my appt, which I didn't aprpeciate at all. What is the point of having an appt if you have to wait 20 mins for it anyway? So, it was not a good experience overall and I wouldn't recommend the salon.",negative
"D'excellents coiffeurs et coiffeuses qui prennent le temps de bien de réussir votre coupe. Autrefois sur Dundas, près du parc Trinity-Bellwoods, ce salon a du déménager dans le quartier de Roncesvalles. Cela fait quelques kilomètres de plus pour certains clients, mais qu'importe, la qualité du service fait qu'on y retourne régulièrement.",positive
This place butchered my hair. I have not worn in down in the month it's been since getting my hair done. They butchered a friend of mine's hair as well. They were fast and friendly but perhaps at the expense of quality. Buyer beware.,negative
"Toronto's best named salon has moved! I had an appointment to see my favourite stylist at Grateful Dead's new location in the Roncesvalles Village. The size of the new salon is about the same as their former one with a few decor differences. The owner did a wonderful job creating a comfortable and beautiful space - check out the velvet skull heads wallpaper on the back wall! So cute! Apart from that, it's the same nice staff going, great work; now in a great neighbourhood!",positive
"I've been going to Grateful Head for about two years now. I love the salon vibe without the attitude. I've always been happy with my cut and colour, and I've gone from platinum blonde flat ironing, back to my natural dark brunette and curls. I love that there's new artwork on the walls each time I visit, they have a great selection of magazines to peruse while your colour is setting, they have stylists that know how to give great curly cuts, that sometimes the owner will surprise you with a complimentary glass of wine, and to top all that off I have discovered many new favourite bands from their playlist!",positive
"I have been to grateful head a few times ( I am under a pseudo name here). I will not be returning. the first time I was very happy with my haircut. the second time I wasn't thrilled . I thought I wouldn't go back but then I thought well, we all have bad days.; So I returned. I HATED my cut. I will not return. I will not recommend the place. I wonder if maybe my stylist only knows one type of cut and basically gives you the same. If you do decide to go there, then I suggest you tell them up front you want to finish with a straight blow dry. I have been meek about insisting on that and i paid for it. Perhaps if they know they cant hide the cut behind curls they will give it a good cut. My hair is still not long enough to fix so I will have to wait a few more weeks. I can tell you, it wont be back to Grateful Head. .. my head was anything but Grateful.",negative
"This is my alternative Great Clips location when for whatever reason (too long a wait, etc.) I don't shuffle on over to my preferred hairstylists at 3073 W. Craig Road. It's in the same shopping plaza at Craig & Decatur as an Albertsons supermarket at which I frequently shop. It's always best to check in online (an extremely convenient feature which also specifies your estimated wait time!) and avoid the hassle of a possibly extremely long wait when arriving unannounced. I have very rarely had to wait very long when doing so and am usually quite expeditiously processed and once again on my merry way in 30 minutes or less. The fact that the hairstylists at all Great Clips document your current haircut preferences/requirements for easy reference during your future return visits helps speed things along. Great Clips haircut coupons make an appearance several times each year in the Las Vegas Review Journal and the wise among us will use them properly and save as much as about $5.00 to $6.00 off the going rate of $13.00 per haircut ($7.99 coupon currently available in the newspaper). The overall quality of the haircut itself and service provided is quite good: I have personally never been disappointed, always a happy camper.",positive
"I would rate this place a zero if I could. I'm glad I didn't stay to get a haircut. I checked in online with 0 wait time. (0 wait time should have raised a red flag...Go figure) I went in with my sons and my aunt to get haircuts before Christmas. I walked in and 2 employees where sitting and didn't acknowledge us. After a couple of minutes, one of them asked if I had checked in online. I said ""yes, that's my name on the screen."" I hadn't registered the other names, so as I spelled the other names out for her, she kept telling me to wait, and then she would say ""go ahead,"" and as I started spelling it out for her again, she would tell me to wait. She attempted to spell my son's name and she spelled it incorrectly. I told her what the last person's name was and I began spelling it for her and with the worst attitude, she said, ""I know how to spell."" By that time I had enough of her attitude and my wife asked if I wanted to leave and I replied, ""yes."" I went down the street to a different Great Clips and it was an absolutely better experience. As soon as we walked in, they greeted me & checked me in. They were way busier than the other location. It was a good thirty minute wait, but well worth it! Go there instead by the Winco on Decatur.",negative
"I've been going here for years. They do a great job, they're super friendly and quick! I recommend downloading the app and checking in online. I hate waiting.",positive
donna cannot competently cut any specific hairstyle according to your expectations. no wonder there's no wait time at this location because there is zero repeat customers. i highly do not recommend this establishment and will steer everyone i can away from having a disappointing experience here.,negative
"My son went in asking for a scissor cut on top and taper down. First thing, got the clippers and cut the front hairline higher than I could ever imagine. He is not happy and every person who sees him asks who messed up his hair. Because I am human and realize people make mistakes and the world is not perfect, I called to see if I could get a refund or a discount on a future cut with our old stylist....still willing to go back, considering we have went there for about two years with no problems, was promised a call back and still NO call back to date. Sucks!! I have four boys who go there, we live around the corner uuurrrggg",negative
Let me start by saying I'm very particular about my hair but don't want to spend an hour for a haircut. My friend Brandon said they have great staff and know what you want with a couple questions. He was right. The work speaks for itself. Try it out,positive
"Just got a haircut from here, showed a picture of Jensen Ackles as a reference for my hairstyle, my stylist was extremely rude and purposefully cut the top of my hair using a size 1 clipper (which is basically bald) because she was impatient with the fact that I was being picky about how I wanted my haircut. At no point in time was I rude, so this isn't a spite induced attack at the store, the store manager even agreed with me. But in all honesty I'm extremely infuriated because it seemed like the stylist (some Philipina woman) was out to spite ME for being picky like I dont have the right to be about my own hair. Xis is my usual stylist and does a fantastic job you should definitely go to this location for his quality haircuts and the others, but that one particular stylist should never be apart of anything customer service related whatsoever due to her impatience, lack for empathy, and unaccountabilty of her actions. Now I'll have to wait a good month or two before even considering to style my hair the way I want it. Thanks Great Clips",negative
"Chae... I pray I'm spelling her name correctly... is absolutely precious. I've seen her twice and both times great haircuts. And to top it off she's extremely friendly, beautiful smile, and nice conversationalist. I called the manager that day to tell him about her quality and he said he'd pass along the compliments. I am hoping he did. Thank you.",positive
"I have gone there about 6 times over the past couple of years, usually good. I went the other day & I should of known better when the person cutting my hair was wearing sunglasses. One side was longer than the other side, didn't trim my sideburns. Very bad haircut.",negative
"First time clients must register so they can look you up in their system by your phone number. I'm from California so men's haircut is only $8 & it's a top notch barber shop, can't beat the price. The prices in Vegas is ridiculous. I figured I'll give this place a try for $13. I asked for a ""skin high fade"" (straight fade) & I came out looking SHREK. She gave me a high pineapple fade. I didn't want to complain and make it worse, I don't plan on coming back. Very disappointed. Would not recommend this place.",negative
"The staff, & management were great, especially Janie! She was so helpful, friendly & was wonderful! I would highly recommend this location!",positive
Great and Fast service by Sonia! Directly what I wanted and got in an out quickly... great for people who know what they want and are on a busy schedule,positive

"Both my boys got haircuts here. Specific to my instructions, they got their perfect do's. :). The hairdressers are very accommodating. Wait time is reasonable unlike other great clips. Definitely will be back.",positive
"Online check in with a 5-minute wait time. Checked it at 1 minute wait. Sat for 20 minutes, several others came in, checked in and went through, they were online check-ins so I figured they did so before me. One stylist a bit too chatty and upselling with a finished customer for a solid amount of time, going off topic a bit. At about 40 minutes of waiting a walk-in gets checked in and walked right to a chair, asked whats going on with the queue, looks like she deleted me when I confirmed my check in initially. She game a half-hearted apology of 'something wrong in the system' trying to shake blame off herself and go back to her chair. Would have been okay if she was genuine about her mistake. Couldn't get myself to support this location, won't be back.",negative
"Sonia is excellent twice she's given me a great cut the way I wanted. The haircut was a high fade zero all the way up on the top. Before I got my haircut done another way but now I always get it done this style thanks to their keen eye and suggestions from other stylists. Thanks again Sonia for being clean, courteous, and polite!",positive
"What a disappointment! The Asian woman with a buzz cut (jojo?) did exactly the opposite of what I wanted. Even after repeatedly requesting my instruction. She even actively disagree with me. I have to go to another shop to fix it. It only cost 13 bucks, so I guess you get what you pay for",negative
Very friendly staff at this location. I went with my fiance mom and she used the app to check in. As soon as we got there we were seen. Immediately washed and taken care of. If you need a quick and easy service you should definitely stop in here.,positive
"First off... Let me preface this with the fact that I am well aware that I have thick hair and on this particular visit it was super long. So my boyfriend frequents this Great clips because it's closest to our home. He only goes there when this particular hair dresser is on duty because she's ""great"". I decide I need a hair cut and stop by Great Clips hoping that ""great"" hairdresser is available. I walk in, she's in and there aren't many people waiting. GOOD. I check in and wait. I should say that while waiting 2 people complain about another hairdresser on duty. The culture is very quick clip and go. Still. I wait. Finally my turn. She greets me and I sit but I warn her about my length and I make her fully aware that I wanted to chop a good amount off. No biggie, right? She begins by almost discouraging me about the amount I wanted to cut. Asking me ""Are you sure?"" at least 4 times. Whatever. I'm already on the chair. She starts to brush through my hair and my head was snapping back so hard and I was clearly in discomfort but she keeps brushing through until I ask her if I can brush through my own hair. Not once did she apologize or seem to acknowledge the discomfort. As she begins to measure out the length and confirm with me I ask her if it was possible to make a first cut long enough and then we can go from there if I wanted to go shorter. She claimed that she couldn't do that because then she'd have to charge me two haircuts. OK?!... We go back and forth and I settle with ""bra strap"" length. I figured that's long enough to get used to shorter hair than what I've had for 5 years now. She starts chopping off and I remind her that I didn't want a blunt straight cut and she says ""then how do you want it?"" At this point I'm ready to get out of the chair except she's already chopped off half of the hair. I asked her to do what they call a ""notch cut"" which makes the hair look more choppy than straight cut. As she's cutting my hair, they get a new customer and another hair dresser checks them in and I can hear the customer being told that the wait would be 15 minutes. My hairdresser butts in and says ""more like 30, I've got a lot of hair here"" not in a joking way, not in a light hearted way but in a tone of annoyance. Anyway. She basically finishes my haircut and shows me the mirror and my hair is shoulder length!!!! SHOULDER LENGTH!!!!! Not mid back... Not ""bra strap"" length, as she called it"" but SHOULDER LENGTH!!!!! What am I supposed to say ""it's too short!! Glue it all back on"" I paid, tipped and left. The only reason why I tipped was because it was a lot of hair to cut. So here is my recommendation. 1. DO come here if you're a guy. They've got the quick, clip and go thing down. 2. DO check in online. Everyone that walked in and had not checked in online ended up waiting upwards of 30 minutes. 3. DO NOT come here if you are looking for customer service and a friendly experience. 4. DO NOT come here if you want anything other than a trim and buzz cut ( duh. I know. But I've been to the great clips on rainbow and they've styled my hair better than a $90 hairdresser would. all in all. I learned my lesson. Never again.",negative
"$9 dollar men's #1 guard medium fade haircut. I got the deal from the Yelp app. Originally a $12 haircut, so not a bad deal. The haircut was good, it's a men's #1 fade, so it's pretty easy. It only took about 10-15 mins for the haircut and turned out pretty decent. I will be back to location again, thanks!",positive
"Gave this place a second try after a horrible experience the first time. Shouldn't have. Paid 16$ for a shampoo & trim. The whole process took less than 10 minutes (RED FLAG) and the stylist sent me out into the cold with wet hair after blow drying for less than a minute. She was extremely rushed even though there was only 1 customer waiting and 4 stylists working. On top of that, the uneven cut I went to get fixed was still uneven after I had left and fixed my hair up myself. I will be trying a different Great Clips location after this disaster.",negative
"Just walked in tonight, it wasn't busy at all which was good. Thought I can use their thingy right here on yelp but the guy working there told me they don't use those anymore so okay. Haircut is just $13 plus if you want shampoo, it's gonna be $3 more. It wasn't pricey at all. The lady who cut my hair was really nice, she asked me some questions and really listened to all the things that I had to say. She suggested me this and that too. Over all, she made a great job on my hair. I really liked it!",positive
They had me walking out with a mullet. I had to finish layering my hair myself. And they were rude with dirty look. I'll stick to my sw durango location,negative
"Incredibly rude employees who shouldn't be allowed to work in customer service positions. I heard them arguing over which one ""had"" to take my special needs family member. If I knew it wouldn't absolutely ruin his self esteem I would have called the ignorant workers out on their blatant discrimination. I will be contacting the corporate office about this awful treatment. I'm absolutely appalled by this behavior.",negative
If you are looking for a professional style cut but at an amazing price you must come to this great clips and let Melody do her work! She always does a phenomenal cut and will have you out the door on your way in minutes.,positive
Melody is great! I live in Anthem and travel across town just to get my hair cut from her. She is very friendly and is always available when I need her services;) She really take her time to make sure you are satisfied. I highly recommend her and her services.,positive
"I am seriously warning everyone to please stay away from this place. Rude workers. Took my 4 year old here to just get a bang trim. I said ""just trim her bangs so it's not in her eyes"" my daughter goes with her stylist (a blonde Mexican woman) and yes comes back with her bangs trimmed plus more!!! She added so much more bangs! Plus cut off all her side bangs!! She seriously had side burns! I said ""what did you do!!!! I only wanted a bang trim! Why is her side bangs gone?"" She said that's how it supposed to be and that will still be $5! They didn't do at all what I asked. Now my daughter's hair looks terrible till the sides grow out. I can't even tie her hair up! It's been a month since her cut, and so far about 20+ people asked me why on earth I cut her side burns, I have to explain to them that that was not me, that was greatclips! Don't go here.",negative
Had my haircut there the other day and came close to walking out. The stylist name was Melody. She's more interested in talking about herself .the haircut that you gave me I had to check myself and it was longer own one side. Not good,negative
"Wait time too long. I went in one day & was informed of a 50 minute wait time, it wouldn't have been too bad if one of the stylists hadn't serviced one of her friends(who was not on the list) before me. Also, it seems like they don't have any management since some of the ""ladies"" working there dress as if they were working in a brothel.",negative
"My husband comes here all the time but this was my 1st time. I've officially popped my great clips cherry. It did not disappoint. Spoke with Barbara on the phone, asked if there was a wait.. Then remembered that you can sign in and make an ""apt"" online so I did. As i got there I saw there were 5 people waiting, then i remembered DAH DAAA, i was 1st cause i signed in online. Going straight to the front and getting a seat.. oh yeah biotches! Of course i got loads of dirty looks but hey, maybe they should have been smart and checked in online, mwahaha! (my evil voice). My hair cutter was Barbara. A nice looking older lady. She was super friendly, we did a lot of talking a talking about my 6 month old that was in the front with my husband. I really liked that she asked what i wanted and was very percise. I'm always afraid to go to someone knew and especially since people say they'll cut an inch and then they cut 4 inches [had that happen to be once upon a time]. She followed my directions to a tee and i left a very happy girl. I shall be back. Love that its cheap, only 12 dollars [even cheaper if you bring your receipt next time which gives you 2 bucks off] For customer service that shines, hair that comes out perfect, and a no wait this is the place to be.",positive
I come here about every 2 weeks and well I can't complain. The prices are not to bad. If you are not 10 years of age or under and or 65 years of age and over then you will pay 12 dollars. If you do fall into those age groups then it is only going to be 10 dollars for you. The customer service is great and well sometimes it is very busy and other times well your in and out no wait but that is probably like any haircut place I presume. They put what you do to your hair in the computer so they know exactly what you want when you check in. Great place if you want a cheap and good haircut.,positive
"2 items, one for me and one for my mom. I get a very simple cut, one length, slightly undercut. That's it. Got a cut by Sarah on 5/5/18 and after I went home, washed and waited for it to dry (I don't blow dry, per Sarah my hair doesn't blow dry correctly because I cut it at one length. Yeah right!) and noticed that one side was significantly longer than the other side (at least 1""). I went in to have her fix it (hey, things happen, right). She actually was arguing with me about whether it was uneven or not, pulling some strands from the very front to the center of my chin as empirical proof of this. I pointed out the uneven portion was behind my ear so that test wouldn't work. I told her to look that one side is touching the top of the shoulder and the other is about 1 inch above the shoulder. THAT is proof of the unevenness of the cut. She finally agreed to fix it and started. Didn't take very long. Then she started to cut the short side shorter I had to stop her. Finally leaving with a so-so cut and a bad feeling overall. On 5/8/18 I called to an appointment on 5/12/18 for my mom to get a cut and perm from Gloria at the shop. I was told ""let me check with Gloria when she comes in at 9 and if the appointment is ok with her you WON'T hear back from us."" I didn't hear back so on the 12th I got mom (who is physically handicapped and on oxygen 24/7) and loaded her into the car and arrived for the appointment at about 10 till our time. I was told that Gloria knew absolutely nothing about our appointment even though is was clearly written in the book (which the shop admitted). Gloria had 2 other's ahead of mom (walk ins who should have been assigned to another stylists at this time) and the wait would be 1 hour! Now a perm and cut usually takes about 3 hours and mom's portable O2 tank had enough in it to ensure we had time for the perm and the return home not an additional 1 hour wait! Seriously, who in the world who has an appointment book doesn't check it each day for their schedule? We left immediately and I & mom won't be back. Maybe Karma was trying to warn mom NOT to trust this shop with her hair and she may have avoided burning her entire head of hair and scalp off.",negative
My hair stylist didn't know how to do a side swept bang. She kept asking me how to do it. I'm not a hair stylist so I don't know how to do it but I know it looks stupid now. I'm paying you for your expertise otherwise I would have done it myself. I am extremely dissatisfied with my cut :( All I can do now it wait for it to grow out and go some place else next time.,negative
"Wow. Easily the WORST chop job I have ever seen. The asshole who did this cut must be BLIND. Multiple lengths, crooked, you name it. I'm 85% sure I could done better job wearing an eye patch. Great Clips in general are garbage. This place is WORSE. How many times can you ""gee I'm sorry, want your money back"" in a single day? And let you fix it? YEAH RIGHT. Like somehow it will magically not be a shitfest now that the manager is cutting it? PLEASE. You get one star because that's the absolute least Yelp allows. BEWARE. THIS PLACE IS TERRIBLE AND I'M RELATIVELY SURE THE POSITIVE REVIEWS ARE FROM THE CUTTER'S FRIENDS AND FAMILY. RUN! RUN FAR AWAY! Spend some money and have it done RIGHT. Have lengths that actually match! Have hair that's cut the way you want it cut! Have hair that doesn't look like it was cut by a drunk with hedge clippers! You deserve better than this apology farm with lots of scissors in it!",negative
Got my haircut by Taylor. Definitely a great stylist. I was scared at first because it was my first time here and first time with Taylor. Very nice and unique location. Will definitely be my go to Great Clips from now on.,positive
We have been coming her for quite a while. This location is in the Albertson's plaza and is open at 8am weekdays. I came up here on Tuesday among my running around doing everything that needed to be done before work because it was haircut time. Haircuts are usually $13 but I had a coupon for $8 haircut. So I used it. (When you go they get your address and you get coupons in the mail for future months.) I was happy with my haircut and walked out with half as much hair on my head as I did walking in....which is good with the summer coming up.,positive
"I don't even know if this is the right Great Clips (the one next to albertsons) but I came here today after a botched haircut I got from another salon a couple days before that, which has left me with endless nights of no sleep :( . So any who I came in and Chong aka this awesome skilled hairstylist from the deep dish Chicago area hooked me up with an amazing haircut and did her best to fix my botched choppy short hair into something I can walk around with during the daytime and people not thinking I'm the bride of Frankenstein. She saved my life in every way a person can be saved. (Here I go quoting titanic.) But lol no really my hair was so bad and she saved it at such an amazing price. The price was so cheap that I was nervous (or maybe it was cheap to me coming from New York where a trim cost like 40 dollars) but all in all this lady hooked me up and I got to practice my limited knowledge of Korean language on her. Anywho she's like a lifesaver making bad hair cuts beautiful again. Thank you!",positive
Our experience here was not even satisfactory. My husband checked in online. When we got there they told us his profile wasn't coming up but his name was on the screen. How is it that you're telling us we aren't checked in when our name is clearly on the screen. The wait time had also been pushed back as we walked in. They said they hold the spot an hour we got there early. Marissa calls my husband to cut his hair and he specifically asks for a medium fade from 0-2 and she takes the 0 all the way to the top of his head.... did not do a good job on the fade so it looks like he is wearing a rabbi cap. She didn't even give him a line up he had to ask her when she started brushing the hair off him. We won't be going back or recommending this place to anyone.,negative
In and out in 20 minutes with a nice haircut. Clean shop with pleasant stylist. Had a coupon so my haircut was at a reduced price. Very satisfied in every way. I am a man so I can't comment on lady's services.,positive
"The past 10 years I have used Great Clips at Aliante and on Ann & Simmons exclusively for cut, shampoo & styles. Today after I checked in on-line for Aliante and upon arrival, there was a girl (Janelle) who works there who hollered up at me while she was working on a client and in front of the entire store's staff and clients. Come to find out she's the Manager of the store. She said ""you know it's going to be $50 just to style your shoulder-length hair plus the cut and the shampoo will bring it up to $78 bucks"". She proceeded to tell me that it's a Great Clips' guideline over the past several months. Well...I go in twice a month for shampoo and style; pay the usual $19 PLUS an $11 tip for God's sake bringing the tab to $30. When she explained in front of everyone in the store that I am mistaken, that did it for me...I chose to go to the Ann location. I explained the situation to them and the style charge for shoulder-length hair is $24. So... they weren't sure why I was quoted $50 at Aliante-particularly when I was having my hair cut short! This review is more for Great Clips management (Leona) than for the general public. However, I would never recommend the Aliante location due to this one incident perpetrated by the store Manager.",negative
Always a quick in and out and no one has hacked all my hair off just yet. Argentina was amazing and such a friendly person to chat with while getting a much needed trim and cut for my bangs. I'll be seeing her again when I need a trim in Las Vegas :),positive
"If you want it done right, ask for Marisa. She knows how to cut blonde hair, how to cut for your face shape, just ask. Same with everything. You never know till you ask. Thanks Marisa congrats on manager! Most others I'd give 4 stars but for one of them I'd give 2 stars. Cant remember her name.. Better safe than sorry!",positive
"Fast and efficient at reasonable price. Really liked the twilight discount and the prompt service I received. My stylist was friendly and did a great job for the most part. There was a small section that got missed but it was very difficult to notice unless you were looking closely in the mirror. I was able to take care of it at my house. Anyways, since I usually cut my own hair I probably won't be back here but if I had to go get my hair cut by someone again I would come back. All in all I have no complaints about my visit here. To paint a better picture of my experience I showed up and waited about 10 minutes. There were two or three other people in front of me and three hairstylist. I highly recommend that if you do go to one of the stores that you check in online as it will make your stance much quicker. I was there a total of 30 minutes from start to finish.",positive
"If I could give 0 stars I would, the lady that cut my hair barely spoke any English and used some outdated clippers. She totally ruined my hair. I usually go to the Winterwood location where they are a lot more better at their job. Anyways when I go to pay I give them a coupon to save a few dollars and the manager said they don't accept them, I never had a problem before. I will definitely not be back!",negative
Got a hair cut today at this location and staffs are not really paying attention to the customer request. They were to busy chit chatting with each other. I ask for fade only on the side of my head and totally shave all my hair which I could done it my self. Those locations is breading place for new bees and I won't highly recommend this place. They will try to be friendly with so you won't complain about their uneven haircut. This place is sucks.. definitely won't go back again..,negative
This place is great for an inexpensive hair cut. You can check in online and there really is not much of a wait. The staff are very friendly and listen to what you want.,positive
"I usually take my kids to get their cuts here and I've never had an issue. I decided to take my mother to get a trim here and checked in online as I always do, there was one person ahead of us, and she said we were next. A family of 4 came in after us and the lady at the counter asked them if they had checked in online, she replied no so she checked them in. The one person ahead of us was called and we saw on the screen that my mother was next. As soon as the next stylist became available we thought we were going to be called next, however she called the person after us. I approached her and brought it up and she told me they had checked in online and they were before us. It made me more upset that she thought I was that stupid to believe her, I clearly saw my mothers name next on the screen and heard her conversation. Because of this I will NOT be taking my kids here anymore.",negative
"This is a good location and business to receive a quick quality haircut. If you check in online, or using the app, it usually will save you a few minutes wait time. They store your previous haircut information, and ask you if you want the same type of cut. Friendly staff.",positive
"Great clips is not really known for great haircuts...from previous experiences. However, this place exceeded my expectations. I got a cut from Brittany and she was nice and friendly but most importantly she knew how to cut hair. I will definitely be back to get my bi - monthly haircut.",positive
"I live about 30 minutes away with many other hair cut spots on the way but I come back to see Stephanie because she does a fantastic job and I know we will leave happy. My son loves her and she is able to work with his crazy hair and leaves it looking great until his next hair cut. She did my daughter's first haircut today and made her first experience, comfortable and most of all she had my daughter smiling the entire time. I highly recommend this spot. Everyone always welcomes you with a smile and they do awesome work.",positive
"Just sat in Great Clips among many tired customers on a busy Saturday and listened to three stylists argue for 15 minutes over who took whose customer. When I approached them at the register and suggested that this wasn't the time to figure this out, they said they had to figure it out now before taking anymore customers. I said I was ready to walk out and did shortly after as they continued their argument. I went in back in to ask for the business owner's contact information. I was given a number for corporate because the owner ""doesn't allow his information to be given out"". If I was an owner, I would want to know my employees acted this way.",negative
"I had to return because the cut received was so poor. After re-cut, still looked awful. Would not recommend unless getting a complete shave.",negative
I don't know what to read it yet because I just have a question. Does this place color hair too? I've been reading some of the reviews for haircuts and what not but I wonder if great clips colors hair? UPDATE: I have a wonderful person who cut my hair at this location. She even styled it a little bit...she did a really great job in regards to my layers and informing me of how often I should come back. I'll be back over there in less than six weeks. Thank you. I would recommend you go there for a great haircut and wonderful customer service.,positive
Jennifer cut my hair. I had her just follow what i already had just freshen it up by getting rid of the dead ends. She did a great job. She was very pleasant and got me in and out but not rushed. Will come back.,positive
I guess checking in online no longer does you any good. I was the top person on a list on 9 and had to wait to the end because I didn't check in according to the lady at the desk. Doesn't that defeat the whole purpose of the app? I've been to a half dozen other great clips with no problem with the online checkin but I guess the ladies don't like technology and demand you come to the desk and check in. Not only was she rude in front of many people but told me it's like checking it for dinner. Thanks for the extra hour wait! Last time coming to this store. Don't be scared of change!,negative
"The associates at this location are by the nicest group I've met. Not only do they have a nice flow and work well with others but their hair styles are experienced and do a great job. I usually never get my hair cut here because I had a terrifying experience at a great clips as a child... they cut off half when it was only a trim so when I visited this location it was purely because I was going crazy with my out grown hair and my father along with my husband go to this exact location so I decided to give them a shot... They rock! I was greeted at the door, helped in a times manner and my hair cut was fantastic!",positive
Maria thanks for the great cut 5 stars thanks pat . Maria she was efficient and also pays attention to details even checks her work does a wonderful styled hair cut. Nice job.,positive
"If I could give them a zero I would. The customer service is awful and the young girl up front is a smart ass. We checked in online and it said a 57 min wait. We arrived exactly at that time and the girl stated it would be another 15 min, so what is the point of online checking times if they are not accurate? Try to go somewhere else if you can as this place sucks on all accounts.",negative
"I don't know about anyone else, but I hate the online check in. I don't use it, I just go in and see how long it'll take and decide if I'll wait or not. I've been sitting here for 30 minutes already because online check ins beat me to a couple spots. That system is flawed and if someone checks in and brings 4 people, it throws the whole order out. Nothing wrong with the stylists here, they've always been good but they seem under staffed at peak times and the online check in has a room full of people that hasn't changed much in fifteen mintues.",negative
The online check-in tool is the greatest thing since sliced bread. I'm in and out quickly and my haircut is good 99% of the time. No business nails it 100% of the time.,positive
"I went in to get a haircut and of course I already knew what I wanted. I shower the girl that was cutting my hair a picture of what I wanted and she nailed it! I love my new haircut. The only thing I had a problem with was how long the wait was. When I walked in I wasn't even greeted, and no one asked to sign me in. So while I was sitting there I checked in online to make sure my spot was saved. Their was nine people on their list by the time I was called and only 3 girls cutting hair, but their was more people in their backroom laughing and chatting. I could tell that some of the people waiting were a little uneasy. Next time I'll check in before I get there and maybe call and ask hoe many people are waiting ahead.",positive
"I would rate lower if I could. These people do not know how to cut hair or keep customers in order. They have messed up my boys haircuts so often that I now take them elsewhere. My cut is simple, a 2 on to & 1 on the sides. I still went there because it was convenient. Today I checked in online with a 17 min wait. I ran into the store next door then went to great clips. That usually means you'll have a few mins wait as it ""holds your place in line"". After I checked in & was told it would be just a moment. Then I watched as 4 other people came in & were taken back before i was. Now this wouldn't be all bad as 3 said they checked in online. It was possible they did so before I did (although not likely). The other guy did not check in online & was told it would probably be abt 15 mins. As I sat there over 15 mins (what is the point of the online check in at this point) and waited patiently, they then call the guy who did not check in online & arrived about 10 mins after me. When I said something as he was still standing there, I was told I would be next. This is unacceptable. I walked out. They will never see another dime from me or my family. I highly do not recommend unless you want a bad cut or your time waisted. There is a barber shop in the same plaza on the other side of Albertsons that will take care of you in a timely manner & won't give you a bad hair cut.",negative
"So we are still avid visitors and since my last review we have received pretty great service. Today's visit was just as great. Brittany was patient with my son, suggestive as to how to get the look he wanted, she even explained what she was doing and checked in with me to see what I thought. The friendliness of the staff is great from the moment you walk in to the moment you say good bye.",positive
"I come in here every once in a while when my personal stylist is not available. Although nearly every time I walk out of their doors, I am not completely satisfied. Recently, a few weeks after my trim here, I went to my personal stylist for a revamp. She immediately questioned, ""who did your hair?!?"" I had NO idea that the ends of my hair were cut to a diagonal. How could any stylist allow their customer to walk out like that?! I get it, maybe she was having an off day, but as I stated, it is not often that I leave very content with my hair. Additionally, many of the employees work a little too fast and it makes me nervous that they're not striving for a precise cut (I am an example).",negative
"Went in here on Mother's Day to get a haircut as my usual spot was closed. I knew my hair was gonna get jacked up and I was right. I got a fade on my right side, but my left side is a solid 1 all the way up. Oh well just confirmed my thoughts on great clips. Now I get to tell my friends I got ""great clipped"".",negative
"Now I have tried many salons and barber shops here in vegas! Often times I have been disappointed. I stumbled into this great clips after having a terrible experience at a high end salon and thought I would just drop in to get a quick cut, anything would have been better than my last experience. Aprehensive I sat down and explain to the gentleman Jamie that I had a bad experience at the last place I tried (mind you cost me $50 for a men's cut). He assured me I would be taken care of and got it right the first time. I recommend you download the app, check in online and ask for Jamie! He is incredible and very talented. But also has a great personality and easy to get along with. He is the one I see every two weeks and because of his talent and customer service 5 stars Great Clips! You guys have a gem in your salon. I will follow him wherever he goes as long has he cuts hair.",positive
Awesome hair cute! Thank you so much Gina ! So excited for prom and she even made my bangs even when before they weren't! Thank you so much! Would recommend!,positive
"My son needed a hair cut and the lady was very nice! It's not often that my husband is happy with his or our son's hair cut. But he was happy this time. And what was nice was that there was no wait today. My son came out looking exactly like his dad!! I suggest going during the week, during the day, because there is less traffic.",positive
"I received a coupon in my personal email regarding $5 less in regular haircut. When we were about to pay, the bar code was scanned but JONI (another hairstylist) interrupted and shouted across the room saying that mobile coupon is NOT allowed (even if it already went in and reduced $5). I don't understand why it is not accepted. Then she kept shouting while there were a lot of people that my coupon is invalid. This pissed me off because JONI could have said it in a polite way but she just kept going making it seem like I got the coupon elsewhere or made it up. That girl was so UNPROFESSIONAL.",negative
"I've been getting my men's haircut by Elaine since last year at this Salon, and she's done a great job each time. I didn't mind a 2-hour wait to get my usual haircut the other day--she's worth the wait.",positive
Awesome experience ! Great experience w Brittany S. nicest employee I've met yet at a great clips . I highly recommend her !,positive
The stylists here are great with my kids! Always a great cut and it doesn't take much time at all. I like being able to check in online.,positive
This place is bullshit my husband check in and we've been waiting for 1hr then we walked out they took people who dont check in online first it looks like they pick people they want to serve they dont follow on who ever gets check in first or whoever gets in first we are so upset about it.,negative
I can't thank Joni enough for fixing an absolute scalping that I got at another chain hair stylist shop. They have my business forever.,positive
"My go to place for a haircut. I love them for the reasonable prices - $12 for a men's haircut and for the online check in. I never wait for a haircut and that to me is awesome. The service is always good and the staff is super friendly and take good care of me. They have notes on my last haircut to make things easy. The inside is always clean despite the constant cutting of hair going on. The keep the place tidy between customers unlike some other places I have been to. Once done with your haircut the checkout is super fast and you are on your way looking better and ready for whatever the day brings. I highly recommend you get their App and start using them for your haircuts. Great service, online check-ins and good prices - what more could you ask for!",positive
"I checked in and calculated my time to get there just in time to be in the chair. I had the bad surprise of them taking other people in front of me that supposedly checked in for one person and brought with them 2 more pushing my waiting time for another 20 minutes. I got up and told them that I don't need my appointment any more, and the woman rudely told me ""ok sounds good"". In that case, lady how does my bad review on yelp ""sounds ""???? This location sucks will never go back!!! I ended up going to the warm springs and Durango location and got in the chair right away without any appointment or the stupid check in that is not accurate at",negative
Horrible customer service. I was not approached at all and was the ONLY person waiting. And what made it even better was that every stylist was on their phones and talking! Will definitely not be coming back here. Don't come here if you want lousy service.,negative
Joni & Elaine did a great job with both are kids haircuts. Got mine right after. They were both very nice & professional. Would definitely recommend this place.,positive
I always go to anna for my haircuts! If your looking for a good fade with the right clippers! She keeps her fades tight and clean!,positive
Been here for 30 minutes and counting. Checked in at 1:30pm on the app and says 15 minute wait. I get here at 1:50pm and there are 8 people checked in before me.,negative
Was just there is think I made a great decision to leave... I waited patiently for my turn only to find out I was gonna be skipped. The ones that they decided to prioritized were the two they already called and were not there. No communication from the people that worked there about what's going on! They didn't even wanna look at me after they decided to take two others before me that arrived after me. It was my first time at great Clips and I'm glad I saved myself from anymore bad decisions by staying there. This place has no customer service. You can tell by the way they talk to you and ask you questions that they don't know proper communication. And as a first timer they made me feel more embarrassed of being one then making me feel welcome. I have never gotten or came for the discounts of this place but I will never accept there discounted cuts if they will also discount the already poor service they offer. I should have know better anyways. Going to the salon should be a treat not a nightmare and I will let everybody I know personally and in social media that this establishment are ones that you just ignore even if it were the last salons in the world... if I could give a negative 10 star I would,negative
"I visited this shop, first i have no good experience, after awhile gave another try and got worst cut, and that would be my last visit here!",negative
"Worst haircut I've ever received. Told her to trim the top and the side a 1, low fade. She decided to disregard my request and gave me a high fade, then butchered one side of my head. Had to go back to get it fixed and she cut the top super short and still left a bunch of long hairs and left my hair uneven. Been wearing a hat everywhere Tim my hair grows back a bit to fix it. I didn't want to go bald or really short. Will never return here even if they gave me free hair cuts. I gave myself better hair cuts in the military.",negative
"My son usually goes to the S. Durango location but we came to this location for the first time since they were open on Easter Sunday and will NEVER come back! My son checked in online as he usually does and gets called within a few minutes (the only positive from this visit) More and more people start to come in (some check-ins and some walk-ins). There were 3 stylists working and the one lady (don't remember her name but she was the older one and was caucasian, the other 2 ladies were asian and hispanic) closest to front counter was rude when customers checking in would ask for an approximate wait time. She would say ""we're doing the best we can"" in a rude tone when all the customer wants to know is if he has time to walk to albertsons. I understand you're feeling overwhelmed because the salon went from 2 customers to about 5-6 waiting but that doesn't mean you have to be rude. Anyway, my son finishes his haircut and I go to pay and she seemed to rush me. As soon as the receipt printed she threw it on the counter then also threw the pen on the counter. As I started to sign she was impatiently waiting for my copy of the receipt to print out. Then I asked if they had gift cards and right away she says no once again in a rude tone. I shouldn't have left her a tip! We definitely won't be coming back here!",negative
I come here a couple times when i need a quick fade. Sometimes i cant make it downtown to where my usual barber short is. But it still does the job. Especially dor the price. I mean... You dont get the usual barber talk. But you still get what you want for the most part.,negative
I haven't gone to great clips in a while because I'm trying to grow out my hair. I haven't had any complaints whatsoever with the stylists that have done my hair. I was really pleased and my hair is growing out beautifully. I would definitely go again if I need my annual haircut. I would recommend the manager for the ladies. He does a really great job! :D,positive
Great Clips is the best place to cut your hair especially this one. They are extremely nice people. The service is wonderful. I always have a wonderful experience. The always have a big selection in haircuts.,positive
Convenient and close to home! Great customer service. Receive a discount for writing a review...awesome! Great price and great stylists,positive
"We all know that sometimes people get busy and are unable to provide good customer service, which is always reasonable. Unfortunately, this establishment had several opportunities to provide us with DESCENT customer service and has failed every chance they were given. They provided us with inaccurate estimation of time. They were not able to check us in on three accounts. They took a couple of people ahead of us even though we were waiting there first. Overall, l they left a very distasteful taste in my mouth. I highly suggest to find a different hair salon shop. This place was TERRIBLE!",negative
"Used to love taking my son here to get his haircut. But even checking in early online on my iphone app, I found myself waiting for a while at their register to be waited on. I was ignored by the 3 people who saw me. So we sat down since I thought we already did the online check in. Then 2 other customers walked in and they were greeted immediately. I had to let the lady know at the register that I have been waiting and the customer let me talk to her. So my son was up next. Just very poor service. Will not come here again. It's too bad the guy who always cut my son's hair doesn't work there anymore. He was an A++. Always fantastic!",negative
"Came in with my husband here and the lady was just plain DISRESPECTFUL. My husband told me to explain how he wants his cut to the lady and when i did, she just told me to go sit cos i dont have to come with him and when i started explaining she gave me an attitude and kept yawning. Wth? Really. On top of that he had to make my husband repeat everything i said and act like nothing happened. Picked this place coz it was the closest and our usual stylist is out. Definetely not coming back here. I can't stand her attitude!",negative
"This is the only Great Clips that does NOT have a monitor visible to the guest to see where you are in line. Which leads to incidents like I had where I checked in online, and then watched as people who arrived after me kept getting called. The stylist said they also checked in online. My 15 minute quote only became 27 because somebody gave up his turn. Without a visible monitor I had to believe the stylist. Who proceeded to give me a rushed, crappy cut while telling me how the other person was ok waiting, ""he's a regular"". Awkward situation & bad haircut = Never going to this location again.",negative
Have been going to this location for 9 years. Staff are friendly and do a good job. Sometimes busy but the online check in speeds things up.,positive
Normally get my haircut at the barber or do it myself but was in a rush running errands and stopped in here. I like the online check in app they have. It makes it a lot quicker and more convenient. The lady that cut my hair was pleasant and did a good job. Normally they ever get it right on the sides cause they don't go low enough but she did a good job. Place was clean but for the price they charge now I'd rather pay a couple extra and get the barbershop experience.,positive
The best great clips in the area. All of the stylists I have had have been great. Going to the same great clips is nice because they keep your hairstyle in the computer. Each of my boys has their style done the same way each time. Use the online checkin no matter what. Because you can spend your time waiting at home or getting a coffee.,positive
"Choose other locations! I understand it's cheap, but the 2 haircuts my boys got were terrible! By 2 different stylists! One kid's sideburns was shorter than 1 inch than on the other side. When I pointed this out after he came back to me, the stylist just shrugged and rolled her eyes and kept cutting her current victim's hair. So, I went to the other stylist who was still cutting my other kid's hair. She said sorry, leaned over and snipped it. I guess I should have been grateful. My second kid's haircut seemed better, but his hair wasn't blended in well. Edward Scissorhands probably could have done better. The reason I pay for this service is that I can't do it and don't even pretend to, but come on! Will NOT return to this location- find other locations instead.",negative
"This place is a joke. Granted you get what you pay for, and going in I had zero expectations of service, friendliness, and even kindness. What I got, was still mind-blowing on how awful the people were. I called prior to coming in, asked if they were confident in the cut I was looking for. I was promised that between the 3 hairstylists they could help. I was not asking for a difficult cut, just a long pixie with it stacked in the back. I provided pictures, asked for no length in the front to be taken off. The hairstylist began to cut, first cut being length off the front. I stopped her, asked her once again to not cut the length in the front. She continued cutting, as I was sitting there watching, it was nothing what I asked for. She was rude, very condescending and would continuously cut me off as I was attempting to explain what I wanted. I started to get upset, crying, and she continued making rude comments/remarks that everyone in the place could hear. Then, other customers chimed in on our conversation and joined her in belittling me and making negative comments. I was baffled. This lady directly in front of me spoke of me negatively with other people. This upset me even more, and she refused to cut my hair any further. She asked her coworker to finish. As I moved chairs, I attempted to hold back my tears and explain to the gentleman on how I would like to ""fix"" it. He refused to make one cut on my hair. He said he did not feel comfortable cutting my hair, which the original hairstylist said ""I dont blame you"" from the other side of the salon while another customer sat in her chair. Then, the two began to once again talk negatively about me as I sat there once again crying. I asked for the manager, which the lady who was the original stylist spoke up and said it was her. REALLY?? This was the rude, condescending lady, who is supposed to be a manager, be professional and provide customer service?? I left with a half cut head of hair. I attempted to call the customer service line, made a report, and have not heard a word since. I created a Yelp account for this reason only, to warn others of the complete lack of respect this entire place provides. Save yourself. I will never return.",negative
"This has been my neighborhood Great Clips for about 6 years, and I have had mixed results. Always different stylists, so if you find one that you like, chances are they will not be there when you return in a few months. The last one that I had was really good. She took some time with me, asking me about how I normally style my hair, what products do I use, and listened to my answers. The cut was great and easy to maintain. So when I need a trim to keep it looking good, I find out that she no longer works there. The woman who cut my hair seated me without introduction, asked how I was and what were we doing today? I showed her the picture of my favorite style (which, by now, I'm used to not getting but it's a basis for discussion) and said I wanted a trim. She didn't ask what I liked about the style, or what I use to get it that way. She didn't ask how much length to take off, just started cutting away. She probably took about 7 minutes in all. When it was done, it was not horrible, but in no way what I had asked for. When I came home, I had to cut some of the unevenness from the side and the back (what I could see). It's short and not the style that I know how to work with. I realize that you are not paying a lot for a haircut here; however, you have a reasonable expectation that the stylists will accommodate you and your individual needs, no matter the cost. I give this location 2 stars only because it didn't always suck and the online check-in service is better than sitting around and waiting.",negative
"I have been going to this Great Clips ever since I started getting Jessica as a stylist as she is truly amazing!! All of their staff are courteous and do a nice job but Jessica is very funny, personable, and gives a stellar haircut!!! I will not go anywhere else and if there is a shorter wait at a closer location I will drive the extra miles and sit and wait for her. Thank you Jessica!!!",positive
"Most unprofessional haircut ever! My hairstylist asked me to stand up, so she can cut my hair in the back. She only spent 5 mins to cut my hair, and I have long hair with layers. Never ever wrote any review on Yelp before, but I am so pissed. Just don't waste your money here. Period.",negative
"This salon has a lot of improving to do. Good thing they got rid of that guy we always seemed to get who seemed nazi-esque with kids...yelled at my little one about moving when he squirted water right at his face, didn't block the spray from hitting his face or warn him. Now we seem to consistently get women who can't cut straight. And don't go in near closing time...they clean the floor with that blue bactericidal stuff and you about choke from the fumes...I got attitude when I asked if they could wait until after we left.",negative
"OMG I have been coming to this salon for about 9 months and today I got truly lucky! I'm so phys'd!! I got this girl Mary and for the first time ever I left the salon feeling great ~ instead of thinking ""well I will like it when I do it my self."" I was so happy! She listened to what I said and she told me it wouldn't lay like I thought it would because of my thin hair. She suggested a variation of the same cut and she was totally right on!! Mary rocks!! Great Clips rocks!! KD",positive
"Their computer is down today, every one was checked in manually upon arrival. As it turned out they failed to check me in and you guessed it, when I brought it to their attention when they started taking customers who checked in after me for haircuts they then checked me in, back of the line. I asked if I had to wait at the end of the list or was I next. The lady said I was next...not even an apology....BAD!!! You guessed it, someone else was called and my feet walked out of their store with my cash. I won't be back...ever!!! You gotta be kidding!!!",negative
Ok - I don't get my hair cut here but the boy does. It's a in/out hair place so don't expect something from a salon or barber. While the wait was a little longer than expected(20 mins) they did advertise you could check-in online so you didn't have to wait. The hair dressers were very friendly and pretty quick. Good job on a hair cut at a budget price. Not much you can complain about. For guys - fast/ efficient way to get groomed. Next time we will be trying the online check-in though.,negative
"OMG! I've been going to this location for a little over a year with no issues and good results. Went there yesterday and didn't recognize any of the 'hair cutters' that were there. All I needed was about an inch off the top and trimmed around the ears and neck. So Kelly makes a couple angled cuts in the middle of my head and trims the back, stands back and says ""how's that"". I said ""take a little more off the top"". WAY big mistake. She took a couple big chops off the top, buzzed around the ears and I was done. I knew this was going to be ugly. Went home took a shower and my wife and son said ""what the heck happened to your hair"". Had to run over to Arizona Hair where Eric repaired the mess caused by Kelly at Great Clips. Never again will I step foot in another Great Clips and stay away from Kelly at this location.",negative
"wow, this lady Angelica. She asked me what I wanted and did the opposite. Good thing I look good with short hair. She asked if I wanted my hair short and spiked. I said no and asked her to leave the top so I can slick my hair back. I have short spiked hair now.",negative
"I got my hair cut by Nia who did an awesome wonderwoman Tattoo on it. It was my first time at this salon and first time getting this style. I was SO happy with the result. Nia was friendly, fast and did quality work. The salon itself is nice and they offer you tea/coffee. Nia is new to this location but I know she has experience cutting men's hair since my friends go to her so I was pumped to try her at the new location and she did not disappoint. There was no wait time and I was in and out. I LOVE my cut and everyone stops me to ask about it. Thanks Nia!!!!",positive
I've had my hair coloured by Anya for years and she's fantastic. I even followed her to Hair Artisans from her previous salon.I don't tend to go in for my colour regularily but Anya has magic hands so somehow my hair looks great months after my colour job. During my latest visit I got rose brown hair and it came out even better than the reference photos I brought in. My hair also feels luxuriously silky.,positive
"Summary: -I SPENT $550 (including generous tips) on hair that looked horrible. I was scolded by the colourist who said my hair looked like the picture when it most certainly did not. After the owner tried to fix it, it arguably looked worse. -Balayage skill level is not high amongst this particular colourist and the owner. -Sinead the cheery Irish girl did a great job on the cut. -Spent an additional $300 (tip included) at another salon in Guelph, Ontario to get the colour fixed Full story: I had booked an appointment with Ryan because he did my friend's hair (note she is a blonde) and I didn't have a colorist in Toronto. This was the first time I had ever dyed my hair at a salon and before I could get the balayage that I wanted done, I would have to pay $80 plus tip to release some previous colour from my hair. After getting the ""cocktail"" (which is what he called it) done, he noted that the previous colour lifted so well he probably didn't have to do that Steph. It would have been better if he hadn't told me because now I'm out $100(cocktail plus the tip).but I know there is no way to be able to tell that in advance and it is better to be safe than sorry. The day of my balayage appointment he tried a method which I can say to this day I have never seen done in order to achieve a balayage. It was horrible: I was in the chair for 5.5 hours JUST for foils. He would section off the smallest little pieces on my head, which I didn't say anything about because I wanted to see if maybe he knew a better way than I had seen before. He mentioned that himself and the owner taught balayage classes at the salon which I don't know how that is possible because of the pictures I will be showing later. Because it took so long and I had to get to work, I had to leave the salon with wet hair and I had to style it myself. I got home and did just that and was horrified that I had over 150 thin highlights in a very weird ashy blonde (almost grey looking) colour. My coworkers tried to feign their love for my new do but eventually when I got it fixed by someone else they told me how bad it was. I went back the next day and when I told Ryan I didn't like it he came off SUPER defensive and told me that that was exactly what I had asked for and that the colour in the picture was the same as my hair and that balayage looks better curled and my hair was not curled so I didn't know that it looked exactly like the picture. His aggressive tone and the fact that I had IN TOTAL spent $550 (cocktail, tip, ""balayage"", tip, olaplex, toner) made me cry. I had spend so much money on hair I really DID NOT LIKE. the owner was kind enough to call him away from me and asked to fix my hair for me. I just believe the skill level between Ryan and Rebecca aren't there for balayage. She tried to fix it and after the over processed mess that I had in my hair before she got to it, another process probably wasn't the answer. It was uneven (she started with the left side of my head, then right, then back. When most colourists starts bottom to top.) I had noticed my left side was much blonder than my right and much more processed. In the end, I had to go to my hairstylist in Guelph, ON to get the whole mess fixed. She is great, and did it in one hour foils (which was amazing considering it took 5.5 hours to begin my hair tragedy). It was a fraction of the cost, ONLY $300. Another thing to note is that Teija (my Guelph hairstylist) is on team canada for OMC hairworld competition and she charges more reasonable prices.",negative
"I got my hair dyed by Ryan and he is good. No complaints about his skills. What I am unhappy about was the service I received. I made an appointment right before the busy holiday season and maybe that's why but I just felt really rushed, among other incidents that happened that day. One of the staff who was washing my hair actually said to me, ""How is the head massage? Your people gives the best massage."" I couldn't believe what I just heard from her. I never mentioned my ethnicity to her so I have no clue what 'my people' she was referring to. Also, every time I get my hair washed here, no matter who does it, I always have shampoo in my ears. They aren't careful at all. It's pretty awful to have your ear full of shampoo residue and water. On another note, although this is completely out of the salon's control, the clientele they have can be quite rude. My friend was told to leave the salon if he had a cold (which he didn't). She was quite passive aggressive. Might have something to do with the salon's neighbourhood-but that's of course just an assumption. For the price I paid, I can get much better service somewhere else.",negative
I had a haircut by JJ this morning. I haven't had one since the last time I was there (which was February (2013). My hair is long and one length. I had a long chat with JJ and I put my trust (and hair) in his hands. I wasn't brave enough to do anything too crazy. Plus I didn't want to have to do anything in the mornings besides wash and go. He trimmed about two inches off the back and sides and gave me long layers in the front. Looks and feels great!,positive
"I came here because a colleague had an amazing cut and the salon was near my office. So I called and got a lunch apt. with Sinead. I brought along a picture of a cut I liked but the last hairdresser I had wasn't able to achieve that style to my disappointment. After an analysis, Sinead explained how she would do it by giving more volume at the top and cutting more at the bottom to help give that flip and lift I desperately wanted. She also explained how I should blow dry my hair and what type of shampoo I should use after I asked a lot of questions. My blowdry was amazing, wow, she manipulated the round brush super quickly, I had never seen that before. I've had blowdries elsewhere but the other stylists was slow. The salon was very busy and it was a Tuesday. It was packed for colour and cut. When I left, there were people waiting for their turn. I paid $55 because I got a $20 off since it was my first visit. I can tell you that there's a difference paying $75 vs $55 (what I use to pay elsewhere in Yorkville) for a cut. I also gave a big tip, very important! You get a more experienced hairdresser but also someone who has a different level of technique. I will definitely come back, really happy with the results. Thank you!",positive
"Moving to a new area is always difficult but finding someone you can trust to do your hair has always been a biggie. We've moved a few times over the years and I've never been lucky to get the ""one"" on the first try. I finally lucked out this time, Elise is awesome! She not only took the time to get to know me but what I wanted and actually listened. When she made suggestions, it was based on what I said and her incredible knowledge. While I thought my hair suffered this past year because of health problems, Elise proved me wrong and I was able to keep my long hair! I wished I was good with taking selfies because my hair looks awesome! I'll be sure to have her snap a pic the next time I go. I'm also sorry I don't have a ""before and after"" pic because she rocks. I have no doubt that my hair will look even better on my next visit as I'm still a work in progress and I know that Elise will make that happen. She is wise beyond her years and knows what looks good on you. She'll also do what ""you"" thinks looks good with no judgment. In other words, the perfect hair professional. I look forward to having her remake what I ""thought"" looked good and she's well on her way! Thank you Elise for making me feel beautiful again.",positive
"I can't tell you enough how happy I am to have such a great hair stylist! She is always up with the latest trends and she is so knowledgeable about hair color/extensions. She is so friendly and easygoing. Elise makes sure that you leave her chair feeling happy and confident in your new hair. I wouldn't go to anyone else! Thank you, Elise!",positive
"Elise is the best, I've been going to her for years for cut color and extensions. She's highly experienced in all areas of hair & I've always love my results. Highly recommend!!",positive
"I found this store in the yelp with so many good comments.So I text her for the appointment and describe my hair extension work.At first,she was very enthusiastic,after knowing my extension area only with the bang,so she did not give me any respond anymore.I thought she was busy,I try to call her for several times,leave the voicemail,no answer anymore.Here is to let you know, this is not the way you treat the customer .Aso want other people to know that,from this side,this salon will not be your right choice.",negative
"Elise is amazing! I have been getting keratin bonded extensions from her for about two years now, and my hair has grown so long and is incredibly healthy. At first I was paranoid that the extensions would damage my hair but she assured me that as long as I followed her instructions that would not be the case, and she was right!! I cannot imagine letting anyone else touch my extensions. She is a master artist.",positive
Love Elise!! She's been doing my hair for about 2 1/2 years (moved to Vegas from CA). My friend recommended her and I am happy that she did (it's hard to find a good hairstylist when you move to a new city ) She's always done a great job on my hair/color and is the only person that I trust here. She's one of the sweetest girls I know. Definitely recommend her!!!,positive

"So my first visit to Joni's was Friday 05-04-18. I was actually going for an eyebrow wax. I've been going to several different salons throughout the valley for years, and I must say I am finally ""home "" After previous negative experiences I trusted YELP for guidance and it did not fail me. I specifically typed eyebrow waxing and Hair by Joni came up. Although I wasn't seeking hair services I was impressed by the ratings. My thought was if he's that amazing with hair, then he's got to be off the charts with waxing...He was!! He took his time and was very methodical. He trimmed,plucked,threaded I got the works! He explained where my arch should be and how we were going to work on getting it back.Eyebrows are huge when making a first impression, I usually notice that first when I meet someone and I left pleased and super confident about my experience. I Will definitely be returning and I've already told several of my girlfriends the place to go! Thank you Joni, for a wonderful job!",positive
"Went to Joni for eyebrows, hair, exc. For years..followed him from old salon when he opened this one Hands down best eye brow threading ever!! Great cut, color, and styling as well.. He's the best!!",positive
"If your looking for a hair salon, Hair by Joni is the place to go. I have had the best experience and it has now become the only hair salon will be going to. Joni came up and confirmed my name, introduced himself and treated me with nothing but respect. My next introduction was a fabulous stylist Rusel. I have psorais my scalp and they didn't treat me like a freak, and didn't try to get me to color my hair and with was done with guidance and respect. Rusel did give me a beautiful hair cut with a little flair and sassyness I asked for. Since I didn't get the color I went with a brow/lip wax, it was nearly pain free. I highly recommend Hair by Joni and asking for Rusel.",positive
"Went to get my damaged by box color hair corrected. I was worried about the damage due to the box. Joni took care of it! Added color and hi-lights without further damage. He added stuff to prevent any damage. He did an amazing job and I could not be happier!! Even made me a delicious cappuccino while the color set. While washing I had the best head massage ever! I almost fell asleep. Sent me home with some samples of amazing smelling shampoo! Thank you Joni, I will be back!",positive
"I have long hair, mid back, and VERY particular about who cuts my hair. My hair dresser, who is also a close personal friend, has been unavailable for an extended time, leading my hair not being cut in 9 months. So... in very desperate need of a cut I asked her who she would recommend. She referred me to Joni. I called and was able to get an appointment the same day. I was resigned to losing most of my length due to my neglect and failure to maintain my regular trims. Joni is a miracle worker! I only lost about 4 inches and my hair looks MARVELOUS. He listened to my concerns and made suggestions based on my hair type and face shape. I am so excited and happy with his expertise. I scheduled my next appointment before leaving. Thank you Joni for everything you did.",positive
I'll start my review at a 5 since I haven't been there yet and I'll update it after my apt on Sat. I called and they were very friendly. Got an apt for Sat. They told me to come early for a consult. I have a pic in my head and in pics of what I want but you know sometimes that can't be translated to your actual hair. So let's see what they can do. I'm super excited especially after reading the reviews. The last place I went you couldn't even tell they put color in my hair. She wouldn't even look at my pics of what I wanted. So I'm excited to go somewhere where they are passionate about what they do. I'm hoping I've finally found my for forever hair home. I'll finish my review Sat. When in and got exactly what I wanted. Not only that Joni actually looked at my pics and talked to me about each one and the pros & cons. My color was perfect. My hair looks so healthy. I'm in love it. Joni makes a mean cup of cappuccino too lol. I'll definitely be going here from now on for my cut and color needs. I also should add he is fast. Most places I've gone I'll be there 3 to 4 hour's for cut and color. Joni did 3 colors and cut. 2 hours and 15 mins. It looked this great. Unbelievable!!,positive
"I called for a haircut, shampoo and style and that's what I got! I am happy with my service I received from Joni. I will be back for another haircut and some color! Not only is he great but can get you in too. So it was a win win!",positive
"Very excited for founding the best place to do my hair. RUSEL cut my hair in the best way. I hVe a lot of hair in it is very difficult to have a nice cut. People in the salon is very friendly. I love this new finding and I will continue going. Highly recommended!!,",positive
"I had a wonderful first time experience at Hair by Joni. I was offered different coloring techniques and explained to in full the benefits of each one. I was use to having my colored the same way for 10 years, and was so pleasantly surprised by the new technique I tried. My hair looks perfect, and as an added bonus it was a fun experience. Joni and Rusel are such sweet and kind people, you feel like you are hanging out with family instead being a customer they are trying to rush out of the door. I will definitely continue to go there as well as bring my children there. :)",positive
"Time for an update on my update... Joni is every bit as fantastic, friendly, professional and downright FANTASTIC (I know I already said that but it is worth repeating) as he was the first time I walked through his door. Joni is a gem on both a professional and personal level. I would give him 100 stars if I could and besides that he makes a wonderful Turkish coffee.",positive
Had my hair done by Joni tand he did a fantastic job. So I'm back for my touch up. Prices are great and well worth it. Love this place.,positive
Omg!!! I'm from out of town here in AZ for my step sons wedding. I looked up yelp and read that hair by Joni was great! I was treated with the best hospitality and professional curtesy!! I would recommend this place for hair and makeup with 10 stars!!! Thank you thank!!!,positive
"Joni is simply the best hair stylist I have ever had do my hair. He is trained from around the world and it shows in his style recommendations and finished product. I have brought numerous friends in and they all love what he does whether it's hair, eyebrows, or whatever they come in for. I highly recommend hair by Joni to anyone who wants the best hair experience they have ever had.",positive
"ONE STOP SHOP LADIES! I came in expecting just a trim and a root touch up, and left with a fantastic full service! Joni is by far one of the best hair cutting experiences I have ever had. He took the time to discuss my hair and figure out exactly what I wanted and helped me see what I didn't even know I needed. He did a fantastic job on my color, and cut my hair to get me the exact look I had envisioned just by taking a quick look at a photo I showed him. While I waited for my color to sit, he made me a wonderful cappuccino and made sure I was ok and comfortable. In addition, he also hooked up my eyebrows with my first threading experience. Although I was apprehensive, Joni effortlessly re-shaped my brows and cleaned up my face. I will never bother with plucking or painful waxing again. I will definitely be back for all my salon needs!!On a side note, I have a follow up app. for a facial which I have no doubt will be awesome! A must go to salon, thanks Joni!",positive
"I came in with high expectations due to the high yelp ratings and I have to say they were met. Joni took his time and made sure my hair cut and eyebrows were everything I wanted. This is a family owned business that is very welcoming, I highly recommend this establishment.",positive
"My mom and I were traveling to Phoenix to visit family and we came across this salon based on local Yelp reviews - and we are so glad we listened! The entire experience was excellent - professional, top quality service. On top of transforming our hair (color, cut and highlight), the staff was friendly, took their time with our hair yet were very efficient, and all for very affordable prices. Joni even made us a homemade cappuccino which was better than any coffee shop we have tried in the area. We strongly recommend this place for anyone who wants top quality hair service!",positive
We were referred to Joni by a friend and have been going to him ever since. Perfect brows every time! I would definitely recommend him to anyone!,positive
Such great service from Joni. My boyfriend needed a hair cut badly but was nervous about his hair line. Joni was so helpful and made him so comfortable. Amazing cut and beard trim. We both highly recommend!,positive
"By far the best hair salon I have been to in the Valley! Joni, the guy who styled my hair last Saturday for my friends wedding did an amazing job. I have never had someone do my hair exactly how I want it and it stayed from 10 am till the end of the wedding which was 2 in the morning. Best experience ever and I will be going back not only for styling but to get a hair cut also. Thank you for taking your time and doing my hair exactly how I asked also for not rushing me.",positive
"I pass by this salon every day on my way to work - I finally called and I could kick myself for not calling sooner! Joni is so friendly as is his assistant Marilyn - he took the time to find out what I wanted and we talked about what he was going to do to make things happen. I've been in the process of growing out very short hair - my goal is to once again sport an A-Line Bob - It's going to take me a while to get there but I know my hair is in good hands. My color is beautiful and my cut is sleek! Marilyn happens to be learning and Joni had her help with the color so she could get experience - I LOVE that! They continually offered me coffee or water and just provided a warm, inviting atmosphere! I'm visiting the salon again at the end of October and am bringing 4 additional people with me! So happy to have found Joni - he is awesome!",positive
Joni is the best!! I trust him 100% with my hair! Great recommendations on color & trends!!! Best hair cut in town and bonus of eye brow threading expert!!!,positive
I walked into Joni's salon with severely damaged hair that was bleached twice and turned an orangish brownish color. He took the time and talked me through how to get my hair healthier. He colored and cut my hair back to its natural brown color. My hair is no longer damaged and back to its healthier hair. He is a professional that knows what he's doing. I will definitely be back.,positive
I came in today - I needed a major re-do on my hair. Joni and I spent some time reviewing what I was looking for. I'm mostly gray now and I wanted to remove all the bad old color from my hair and go back to as close to my original hair as possible - which is all salt and pepper now. I had waited a long time to come to the salon again - which allowed Joni to see a large section of my roots and we started from there. We removed all the old color we matched my roots and original color. I love my new hair and I gave Joni free style to cut my hair. He gave me a great new hair style and a perfect re-color/match to my roots. I'm so happy - even my husband was happy to see me back to my old self. It was so nice to be able to have a salon actually listen to what I wanted done - and actually spend the time to make sure it was right. Best stylist I have ever had. Thanks again Joni - You will be happy coming to this salon.,positive
"Hair by Joni is a great salon to go to, they do hair, nails, waxing, threading, ect. I have been coming here for a while now and have been pleased everytime. Being friends with Joni is great he's fun and professional!",positive
Joni does the best job with your eyebrows. He threads which I have a hard time of finding someone who is detailed enough but he does that perfect.,positive
"Joni is the owner and the stylist. He does bridal updos, make-up, bridal parties, proms, threading eyebrows, and the list goes on. I started going to him as a walk in to get my eyebrows done. From the moment I meet him he treated me like family, as I see him interact with his other clients he treats them the same. I leave it up to him when I go get my hair dyed and styled. He always delivers perfection. Every time I don't think he could do any better he always outdoes himself. He also has a nail tech, her name is Nicole. She is just like him. Her work and personality are impeccable. I hope you would take my advice and go to see him and/or I Nicole promise you will not be disappointed.",positive
"Debbie has been cutting my hair for the last 15 years...since I was in high school. I had so many bad hair cut experiences prior to finding Debbie. She has never once let me down. She always gives me a cut and highlights that are both flattering and very up to date with the newest styles. I am constantly being stopped, being asked where I get my hair cut. I live in Flagstaff (2 hours away) and she is so worth the drive. She knows my hair and my style and I trust her completely. If you bring in a picture of what you want, she is honest with you in whether or not your hair could pull that look off (taking into consideration thickness/thinness/texture, etc). Whatever look/cut you and her decide on, you can bet that she will deliver. She is a perfectionist and will make sure your haircut and color meets her high standards. She is also priced wonderfully for her level of expertise! She is very good at educating her clients on how to style their new hair cut so you know how to look fabulous every single day. I will continue to make the drive to see her and would highly recommend her to anyone!!",positive
"Mischa is AWESOME! She's done my hair several times so far and I will definitely keep coming back. I had never dyed my hair when I first came in and she made me really comfortable - it was easy to trust her. I got my bright red at first, and then this last time most recently she lightened it up for me so now I have a more natural strawberry blonde, and I just love how the color came out. Her personality is great, so plan to have fun throughout the entire experience - I highly recommend visiting her for all your cut/color/styling needs!",positive
"Mischa is simply the best of the best.. She was able to get the jet black hair dye out of my hair, and help me go lighter with blonde streaks.. Not only is she amazing at what she does, her customer service is immaculate... She has such a bubbly personality, and is such a positive individual, which helps a lot, considering customer service now a days seems to not be a big factor with some businesses, that will not be the case with Mischa and i highly recommend her to all. I am so happy that i FINALLY found my new hair stylist.",positive
"Mischa made this a fun experience. We laughed and talked for hours! My hair takes long to do but being with her I lost track of time. My hair is fluffy and thick which most hair stylist can't take the frizz away but Mischa did! Not to mention I got s keratin treatment and just love my hair! Thank Mischa for the new cut, color and feel! I will see you again that's for sure!",positive
"Mischa made my first time hair makeover experience absolutely pleasant full. We laughed most of the time I was there. She totally exceeded my expectations, I will definitely be a returning client. Over all, great customer service, very professional, and extremely talented. Thank you Mischa!!!",positive
"Mischa did what I asked her to do, and I've never had this experience before! She listened to exactly what I wanted and she did it! She had me laughing the entire time with her lil ""ball of spunk"" personality. I will be a new regular client!",positive
"Mischa is fantastic!! I really enjoyed my visit with her today. I trusted her right off the bat to do whatever she wanted with my hair and she did not disappoint. I love the organic color she choose as well as my cut. All her products are top notch and my hair looks so much better. I feel great!! It's not easy finding a stylist that you click with and does a wonderful job. I'm so glad I met Mischa. I'll be referring people to her and plan to return as well. Don't hesitate, book an appointment today!! :)",positive
Mischa is amazing!great customer service and my hair came out beautifully.i did a cut and all over color and im so happy with the healthy bounce and shape of my cut as well as the beautiful organic color she did.her prices are very good considering we are in old town Scottsdale and she took her time and made sure my experience was comfortable and pleasant .I will be returning for many more hair appointments!she uses great top notch products like paul mitchell and organic hair dye most places in scottsdale dont do as great of a job and charge an arm and a leg.i highly recommend seeing mischa for all your hair needs,positive
Mischa is an awesome style. Very attentive to details and listens to your needs. Thank you so much for the color and cut. I love it and I highly recommend Mischa is you're looking for a new stylist. She rocks,positive
"Awesome experience, best hair wash this side of town. Mischa did a fabulous job making me dapper....I highly recommend her for all your hair needs.",positive
"Mischa is a fabulous stylist. She gives a great shampoo and a fabulous haircut. She is hilarious,easy to talk to and a great listener. I also love the Paul Mitchell Awapui Shampoo and conditioner she uses! It leaves my hair feeling great and smells wonderful! I highly recommend! I always feel great after my visit with Mischa!!",positive
"Mischa has been doing my hair for several years. I like the vibrant reds with low lights and she does a perfect job! She is creative, great with make-up and fun to talk to.",positive
I always look forward to my appt with Mary Ann...I love how she takes her time and picks the right colors for my hair&highlights!! I get such great compliments on the cut and color. And I love how she takes Sunday & Monday appts 7am-7pm),positive
"I am disappointed, I bought 2 Groupon services to have my hair cut, treated and styled by Maryann. I was looking forward because of the reviews. I called 4 times in a week and half leaving a message each time. I finally received a callback at 8:00 a.m. on a Saturday morning. I believe it was Maryann that called. She seemed confused and just said my name and then said ""I just had a cancellation at 9:00 a.m. on Monday"" and paused. I said I could not make that time, but before I could say anything else (I had another appointment) or ask for another time, Maryann said ""Ok and hung up"" I never received another call. Luckily I was able to get a refund from Groupon.",negative
MaryAnn is a fraud. Purchased a groupon and have been unable to receive services after nearly 6 weeks. She has canceled multiple appointments the am before and due to only working 2 days a week it takes weeks to get another appointment.,negative
I would not recommend Mary Ann! The first time she did my hair it was perfect! Second time - what was supposed to be a 11:00 am appointment turned out to be 4 pm since she did not write it down! Very disorganized. What should have been golden brown color turned out pitch black and the products used caused a lot of itching to the scalp! Disappointing experience overall!!!,negative
"The first time she did my hair she did a great job. However she took over 4 hours to do my color and cut. I was patient and sat basically in the same chair for the entire service. I'm glad that I had no other appts for that day since I wouldn't have been able to do anything else! She is a great colorist, but my advice to you if you are expecting a quicker stylist keep looking. Also, I had to cancel an appt and reschedule but she has not returned any calls so far. My guess is that she is just not at all flexible, so if you make an appt with her, no matter what don't cancel as she seems to simply blow you off at that point. Another thing, called her 2 weeks prior to my birthday to do what she offered as a free follow up color refresh and she got back to me too late to have her do my hair for the event planned on my birthday. I would call her a one hit wonder (except for the incredibly long time she takes getting your hair done.) So, to amend this review: she's now cancelled her appt with me a few hours before my appt, having waited 2 weeks for the second appt. The last appt we had she did not even show up. Honestly she may need to think about retiring at this point if she cannot keep her appts. Well now she has one less client to schedule....",negative
"Mary Ann is a true dedicated hair stylist. She will not be happy until you are happy. She spends the time to ask what kind of hairstyle you are looking for. Then searches with you through magazines until you find something close....a basic place to start. Not only did she repair a recent disastrous haircut but suggested toning down the high-lights in my hair. With Mary Ann knowing the basic hair style I was looking for, I felt confident enough to allow her to do whatever was necessary to achieve my goal. I know my hair needs to grow in some areas and be kept trimmed in others. I am a work in progress but for a first time around haircut and color, I couldn't be happier. Mary Ann is a gem and we are going to have a long, happy relationship. Oh, and I need to mention, Mary Ann charged half of what I was paying other stylists !!!",positive
"I would most likely given her 5 stars but was my first time, let's see how it grows out She absolutely listens to what you like, something I find hard to find in Las Vegas I will definitely go back",positive
"To be honest I usually go to my local Great Clips to get a haircut, but I saw Mary Ann's reviews and her Groupon deal that I couldn't pass it up. She is fiercely passionate about making you look like a movie star. I have NEVER had someone cut my hair with such genuine dedication. She accepts any challenge that is thrown at her, and she does so proudly. I was left speechless when she finished with my hair. My entire life I haven't been able to run my fingers through my hair since it's incredibly dry, and Mary Ann made my hair so soft and healthy looking. I'm obsessed with it. Never going anywhere else but to Mary Ann's!",positive
MaryAnn my hairdresser is amazing with her innate ability to make you look natural and elegant at the same time. She is also reasonably priced and is accommodating to your schedule. Definitely worth a trip here to see her.,positive
Mary Ann is such a sweetheart and very nice to work with! She will listen to what you want and will give suggestions. I am very satisfied with her work. So glad she didn't have to bleach my hair. I brought a picture of what color I wanted to achieve and I think that what she did to my hair is better than the picture! Super love it! I'll definitely recommend her to family and friends!,positive
"I found Mary Ann on Groupon and couldn't pass up the great deal she was offering! I came in with an idea of what I wanted but said I was open to suggestions. She ended up adding some violet into my hair and I love it! I'm really happy with the color, it looks natural indoors and bold in the sunlight which I love. She spent a lot of time with me and I really appreciate the great service. Even though her location is 40 minutes from my house I'll likely be returning! Thank you Mary Ann!",positive
Mary Ann knows what she's doing. I've been looking for a hairstylist for a while now. I believe I've finally found the one. Thanks Mary Ann. Look forward to seeing you soon!,positive
"Found Mary Ann back in March on Groupon, she is amazing and so sweet! She always takes the time to go over hair products, styles, and really take care of my hair. The color & highlights in my hair have never been so pretty. And the best part it's so healthy now!",positive
This charming lady is AMAZING!!! She never ceases to amaze me with her talent & just sheer kindness; I adore her! Give her a try; she is a talented woman with years of experience. I hope some of the cheap-o groupon customers start treating her right; she's a gem!,positive
"I bought this on groupon for $39. It was for hair color, highlights, cut and style. I booked appointment 6 weeks in advance. My appointment was for 3:00. I showed her a picture of the hair color I wanted. Light brown with blond high lights. My hair was currently a dark blonde. Mary Ann started coloring my hair. As she was coloring my hair, another client showed up for her appointment. She worked on us both back and forth. 3 hours later, she had rinsed the highlights from my hair and the other client was also rinsed and waiting for a hair cut. She had another client coming in at 6:30. I asked if I could come back another day for the cut. My hair color was not brown with blonde highlights as I requested, but red with blond highlights. Clearly working on both of us simultaneously was not getting me good results. She told me to come back the next day at 3:00 for the cut. I went home and washed my hair twice with hot water and applied a deep conditioner, trying to get some of the bright red out. Did the same thing the next day prior to my hair cut appointment. The next day my appointment was at 3:00. She was working on someone else when I arrived at 2:50. It was3:40 when I finally got in for the hair cut. Not happy with anything about this stylist.",negative
Love Mrs Mary Ann!!! She fixed my fuzzy and damage hair. Now my hair looks healthy and more manageable. She took her time to explain what kind of product I should use on my hair. My hair has change drastically. Her prices are within my budget. I definitely found my new stylist in Las Vegas.,positive
mayann must be one of the best colonist in town she has just done wonders with my hair and my family you can't go wrong with her outstanding talent and abilities. l highly recommend her for your hair needs.,positive
"I had my first appointment with Mary Ann today, and I cannot rave enough about how pleased I was with her service! Mary Ann comes from a hair styling family and grew up in the business. Speaking as a former hairstylist myself, I give her an A+ on talent, passion, and skill. I have lived in Las Vegas for over three years and have had to salon-hop trying to find someone who I felt comfortable and excited about returning to. I have found my colorist, stylist....and artist in Mary Ann. To add icing to the cake, get the Groupon deal....it's worth ten times the price you'll pay! So happy to have found you, Mary Ann... Glad I took a supply of your business cards, as I will be referring everyone to you. You're the BEST!!",positive
Love my new hair color-correction and hair cut from Mary Ann! She's easy to get along with and knows her stuff. What I liked best is she cares.... She's doesn't care about the money part of business but about you and your hair! Which is cool! I will be back!,positive
I found Mary Ann on groupons and so happy I did. I bough the groupon for my daughter and she gave her a nice cut. The day before I went to a another stylist that butchered me. When she saw my cut she said sit down and I will clean it up for free. She fixed it and I have found my lady. I have a short sassy cut and very light colored hair so it's hard to not look choppy. Mary Ann knows her hair!!!!,positive
I had a great time going with Mary Ann to get my hair cut. Not only that but she took the time to cut my hair and made sure it looked nice. Thank you so much! :),positive
Wow! Amazing. I found Mary Ann with a Groupon. She was the best priced groupon in my area and had appointments available not too far out. Let me tell you - never judge a book by its cover. Don't let her age fool you into judging the talents of this hair artist. She is sweet as can be and hair is her lifes passion. Her prices are more than reasonable and you will feel as though you should have paid 3x or more what you were charged. She has learned from the best - In conversation I found out she studied with a Bay Area renowned stylist that my mother used to hair model for. She truly cares about her clients and her work is spot on. I have grown my hair out from being shaved - it was boring and frumpy to me now. I asked her for something trendy & edgy and boy did she deliver. I LOVE the cut and the purple highlights she did are excellent. I will ALWAYS come see Mary Ann moving forward and refer all my friends. She truly is a master stylist and it was a blessing to have found her. Look no further - she's the REAL DEAL.,positive
I haven't gotten my hair done in a couple years so I wanted something bold and different. Mary Ann assured me I'd love my hair when she's done with it. She took careful consideration of the length and style that would go great with my skin tone and health of my hair. I say she was spot on. I love my new look. She's very pleasant and an all around wonderful person. Thank you Mary Ann you're great!!!,positive
"Today (01/18/15) my sister and I saw Mary Ann for the first time. She was absolutely wonderful! Her knowledge and expertise is astounding, and it's awesome that she continues to learn and keep herself knowledgeable about current trends and techniques. I went in looking for a single process color and just a trim, my sister went in with already short, black hair looking for a dramatic change. Amazingly, Mary Ann made this happen! She transformed my sister's tame pixie cut into an edgy, hot, and daring do! She added beautiful highlights that added depth and even accentuated my sister's eyes. The cut she did was just awesome. I barely have words to describe it. Somehow she gave depth and shape to a very short cut. She is not only experienced, but ensures that she keeps up her knowledge. Mary Ann not only has technique, but she takes her time to make sure each of her clients looks absolutely gorgeous. She does not rush, she wants each of her clients to feel humanized. I have psoriasis (mainly on my scalp) and she took a little extra time to spray an extra moisturizing and healing olive oil mix on it to help it heal. Also, the color mix she used didn't burn (like it normally does). It's amazing to find a hair dresser who genuinely loves what she does, so much so that she makes sure you LOVE you hair. My sister's cut was definitely complicated, and she took her time to make sure it looked PERFECT. My cut was not a complicated one, but she still made sure to take her time and make sure it looks amazing. She even threw some curls in my hair to bring out the color she just did. Not only is she an amazing hair dresser, but she is fun! We were there for quite a while as both colors had to sit, but she made the time fly by as we laughed and talked. We will definitely be planning our visits to her again, most likely on Sunday afternoons when we can take our time and really have a blast! I cannot stress enough how much I loved seeing her today and how much I hope to continue seeing her in the future. Two thumbs WAY WAY up!!! :)",positive
"Frustrated with your hair? Meet a true professional that gives awesome hair cuts and styling at a great and fair price for men and women. I met Mary Ann when she arrived in Las Vegas and worked at Spirals, in Sun City Summerlin, then followed her to the new location at Simmons and Ann Road in North Las Vegas. She is worth the short drive, again for the expertise and the bang for your buck! Spread the word - Mary Ann is awesome! Steve VanSickler Lone Mountain & Durango Las Vegas, NV",positive
"Liana always does an amazing job on my hair. She is a colorist queen! My cuts are always amazing too. She really cares about keeping hair healthy and adds additional conditioners and such to help prevent damage from coloring. She always takes her time to make sure everything is as I want it. She also sells gift certificates which are always a lovely gift idea. I recommend giving the gift of a gift certificate! Always a pleasure to go there and get a cut, color and brow/lip waxing! The salon is beautiful! I highly recommend her!",positive
"I cannot say enough about Liana and her expertise! She took her time and truly wanted to know my desire for my hair. I've never had a stylist so knowledgeable and explained every part of the process. She loves her craft and it shows in the outcome! She cares about the health of your hair and genuinely about you, as a person! You will not regret sitting in Liana's chair. Plus, the place is beautifully decorated and very comfortable!",positive
"Liana is amazing she is one of the best hairdresser's I've ever been to, she took her time and really wanted to know what I wanted, she was so friendly and personable I will recommend her to everyone,I love my color and my cut, she is truly a gift from God.",positive
"I went to see Liana while I was on vacation in Las Vegas as my local hair dresser was on maternity leave and I wanted my hair to look good for my birthday, so I figured I'd get everything done in one shot: haircut, highlights, and blow out. Obviously it was sort of a gamble but I'm glad I took the risk. Liana is great -- she is super sweet, talented, and makes you feel comfortable during the whole appointment. I'm a pretty easy-going client and went with the usual, ""Do what you think looks good!"" but she wouldn't let me get away with it. She was very invested in making sure I got exactly what I wanted. I ended up asking for intense blonde highlights and it's exactly what i got. Super happy with the results and only wish I lived locally so I could see her all the time!",positive
"I went to liana recently after meeting her at the woman's expo at the Cashman center, was a little afraid because my hair has been damaged before by other stylist, however, I absolutely love my hair. She did color and cut and my hair came out AMAZING! Totally love it and she was super friendly. The price was fair and affordable. Would definitely recommend her to my friends.",positive
"BEST RESULTS EVER! PERFECT JOB! Liana was great so full of energy. I came here to get a root touch up on my platinum blonde hair. For those of you who don't know it's a very hard color to work with. I've been platinum blonde for over 7 years and this is the best stylist I've ever been to. She actually cared about my hair and making it look the best it's ever looked. She was full of knowledge and shared with me every step she was taking with my hair process. Liana even sent me home with an amazing product to keep my hair healthy. I'm from out of town and I found this salon/stylist through Groupon. I didn't use a Groupon cause she gave me a great rate on my service with 10% off for being a new customer. The salon is so chic and beautifully decorated. Black and white so many details went into the remodeling of this place. Highly recommend trying this place out. Great for color, cuts or just a special night out blow dry/style.",positive
This is an awesome place! The ladies there are very knowledgeable about the product. Thanks for helping me make a the correct purchase.,positive
"I love this place! They have many options and what they don't have, they can order. Just make sure you have time if order is needed. Sometimes the extensions are made to order and take awhile. The girls here are so kind and informative. My new fav extension shop!",positive
"Ladies, if you wear extensions YOU MUST check this place out!!! First off, I'm a hairstylist that does extensions but I've also worn extensions on and off for 15+ years. I was a loyal client of another brand but about a year ago the quality of their hair went tragically down and the price went up. For months I've searched and used other brands only to be disappointed over and over again. I primarily work with blondes and the hair I found would tangle and shed within a couple washes. Horrible!! I found Hair Exotic and could not be happier!!! When I first went in they didn't carry a lot of lighter colors but after talking with the owner, Brenda, she was beyond accommodating and ordered all colors and lengths I use most often. By the way, they can order 31"" length!! Yesss!!! I now strictly use this company for all of my extension clients and wear it myself. I'm obsessed with the quality and the customer service! I highly recommend this place!!",positive
"Great shop! What can. I say.. Beautiful hair. I'm wearing it now, great prices and fantastic service! What more could you ask for... Run don't walk to this little gem!!",positive
"Wow finally a professional place i can purchase extensions, wigs, ans related products!! Not only are the owners knowledgeable about hair they seem to care about the products they sell. Great tips on how to care for your purchase. They take the hair buying experience to a hold other level. I purchased a bundle and had it trimmed to fit my face perfectly. The hair feels like silk and looks extremely natural. No more shiny plastic disposable hair for me.",positive
I was very interested in hair extensions and decided to visit this location since it is close by. Such a great experience. Brenda explained the difference of the hair and care of extensions and I was amazed at her patience and knowledge. Very happy here,positive
You get what you pay for. They do everything quickly and finish within 10 mins max. They don't really pay attention to lines or anything.,negative
"if youre looking for a simple buzz cut (that pretty much anyone can do), sure you can come here because it is cheap. but if you want to have a decent hairstyle, stay away from this place!!! By miles the worst place you can ever go to for a haircut. you come in, and you look at the hairstylists hairs, it should ring you a bell that there is something wrong with their abilities in style. I gave a second chance to try it, and I regret it so much. my hair doesn't look anywhere close to the picture I gave them, and looking more like trolls. right from the bat, she use a #1 (which I am not aware of), usually people go with #2 or 3 so that you don't cut too short. bam the next 5 seconds, you realize you're in trouble. No point of giving pictures because everyone seem to have a military buzz haircut. all I can say is that simply don't get fooled by the $8 sign because you will end up spending more money going to other hair salon. stay away from this place. Thanks hair king for ruining my Christmas.",negative
"After going to their peanut plaza location I wasn't satisfied because they didn't do my hair that well and didn't know what I wanted. They also hurried me and didn't make me feel welcome. But this location is completely different. All the stylists were friendly and the other patrons all looked quite happy. I showed the same pictures and and asked my stylist about it, and received personal advice as to which cut would look the best on me. Very friendly and encouraged me to take some time to make my decision, unlike the first Hair King I went to. As for the cut itself, she did an awesome job with it. I really hated flat hair but she gave me so many layers and volume to it. She also gave me advice on how to keep the style on my own. It was quick and cheap, and I will definitely consider going back in the future. For ladies (like myself) it costs $13 because our hair is longer.",positive
"Been going to Hair King for 4-5 years now since they opened and they're great. The wait time is usually very fast as they have 4 to 5 staff and all of them are consistent. This is a chinese salon that speaks minimum English, so be clear on what you want. The price is really cheap $8 and up cash only for a haircut. Definitely recommend this place.",positive
"a quick summary: - fast (no appointment needed, done in 15 min) - cheap ($8) - great result (on par with some $30+ haircut I had before)",positive
"I stopped by this place yesterday on a whim. I've seen it many times passing by, and I always wondered if it was any good. I walked in, and was greeted by the stylist right away. It was quite empty actually. She seated me, and asked me what I wanted done. I gave her my regular instructions. She did my hair wonderfully. It was a better cut than I've gotten at many other places (First Choice, Magicuts, Great Clips etc) While she was doing my hair, about three other customers came in and were seated right away. Stylists came out of the back like clowns coming out a car. It was awesome. I'm very picky, and I like to direct the stylist when they're doing my hair, and she didn't seem offended at all. I really like what she's done with my hair, and I will definitely be going back. Also, the cut was only 8 dollars. Thats right. 8. No tax, nothing. I tipped her 50 percent for that awesome job she did. They also have a deal for 30 dollars, cut and colour for men. I might be back for that! :) Oh, and it's cash only.",positive
"Hair Pollution is amazing. But first, can we talk about this person Savannah's ""review"" discussing the Ollie Vaughn parking brouhaha, for a moment? This is a person who is outraged that she isn't allowed to park in spaces reserved for Hair Pollution's customers when she is going to an entirely different business. She feels that Hair Pollution is being mean by trying to ensure parking for their customers, and not allowing other people to park there. The cruelty of it all. If you are swayed by people like this, then I can't help you. Entitled spoiled people who do not understand basic reality often write reviews that slander a small business because they feel personally wronged. It's not new. It's the vindictive nature of forums like these. In reality, the stylists at Hair Pollution are talented and hard working people who value their customers and as a result, simply want the three or four spaces reserved for their clients to be available for them. Not for a person patronizing another store, because she feels entitled to do what she wants. And if you choose to park there when you know it's reserved and that the consequences could be towing, it doesn't make you a victim. It makes you a jerk.",positive
"Love this place, always plenty of parking spaces, and Tad is Amazing!!! This place is the coolest salon in the valley, by far.",positive
I love every minute at hair pollution! Where everyone rocks and wierdness is encouraged! If having white girl dreads wasn't hard enough I wanted to go purple! Jaelen is a talented stylist who always delivers what I want while still being real with me so my hair stays healthy! I cant go kn about them enough they rock everything from purple dreads to the conventional cut and color. If you havent ben in yet you're missing out!,positive
"Hair pollution is the best! I was always a ""serial"" hair dater (I would find a new stylist and go to them for 3 or 4 times and then switch salons, I was never super impressed). Until I found hair pollution. I live in north scottsdale and would gladly go way out of my way to go to this fun and funky salon. Everyone is fantastic! Casual urban chic that caters to an eclectic crowd. I love love love this place. Tad is amazing from extensions to cuts truly exceptional. Jaelen is outstanding as well! She is a class act and would trust her 200%! Cuts are amazing. I have finally made a commitment to the hair pollution team :)! I have been going to them for about a year and half and will continue.",positive
"When I first found Hair Pollution, I was desperately trying to get fit in somewhere around the holidays. I am terrible at making hair appointments in advance, I know this about myself and I have accepted it. I was getting denied over and over, until I called Hair Pollution. They understood my problem and accommodated me, as long as I could get in there within the next 15 minutes. And away I went....flying into an area of downtown Phx that I don't usually visit. I have to admit, upon arriving in the parking lot, I was a little skeptical. BUT....this is the CHARM of Hair Pollution. I met with Jaelen and we immediately hit it off. Her haircut and color were EXACTLY what I needed and I felt like her prices were very fair and reasonable. (In my opinion, its crazy what some stylists charge for a haircut.) I visited her again around April and again, was impressed with her talent and skill. She truly is a hidden gem in the Valley world of stylists. She makes you feel cozy and comfy in her chair, a skill that many hair stylists lack. Hair Pollution is funky, fun, unique, crazy, and a bit over the top....but you never, ever run out of things to look at. Its like a candy store for the eyes! Oh, and they have an amazing product line called EVO, which I never heard of before coming here. Easy Tiger is amazing! I know they are involved with the community as well, and that is impressive for a salon. I will be back for sure!!!!",positive
"This place is an amazing gem - starting with the awesome interior, was covered with funky murals and art but an upscale feel. They offered me water (an essential when living in Phoenix!) or coffee or soda as soon as I came in. Prior to my cut had the most relaxing shampoo EVER complete with head, neck and shoulder massage. (Whatever shampoo he was using smelled like peppermint oil... more cooling off effects!) Cut was exactly what I wanted - something a bit edgy - and far less than expected. (Got a men's style haircut, so it was all of $35. What?? So fantastic.) Absolutely recommend!",positive
"I love this place! Everyone is super friendly! Tad (Owner) is Awesome, and is very active in the community as well! These people do some amazing work! I would definitely let Jaelen cut my hair anytime!!!",positive
Great haircut and color. Chill atmosphere. I was able to make an appointment last minute and still get in! The staff is especially friendly with one gentleman going out of his way to make iced tea for me. Ask for Nate. I love what he did with my hair!,positive
"I LOVE this place! When you first walk in, don't be intimidated by the funky punk vibe... you don't have to be super cool or hipster to come here! Everyone is so sweet and non-judgy. I have been to see both Tad and Nate, and they are both awesome. They really listen to what you want, and don't cut corners. My cut and highlights always look perfect. Every time I walk out I feel fabulous! People constantly ask me where I get my hair done, and I am happy to refer them to Hair Pollution. Even though I live in downtown Scottsdale, it's definitely worth the drive to Phoenix for this place.",positive
"Two words: GINGER LUKE. I have followed this lovely lady for a few years now... from really corporate ""salons,"" through house calls, and now to the amazing Hair Pollution. It took me years to trust anyone with my hair enough to say ""just do whatever you think will look best."" and she nails it EVERY TIME. Though this has been true through all of her places of employment, I can tell she is in her element at Hair Pollution. This salon is a really beautiful establishment. Perfect tribute to all that is modern and cool with that perfect touch of vintage. This is no Regis or Great Clips. This is a salon of artists. Though Ginger is my go-to stylist, by the processes and end results I have witnessed, I can tell the other stylists are equally as talented and true to their original styles/techniques. Highly suggested.",positive
"Shaunz hooked it up like no one else. I was in town for a family affair and needed a trim. I wasn't quite sure what I was looking for but I knew I needed a new style, the whole Into The Wild look was getting old. After talking for a bit and showing me some hip men's styles he finally convinced me to take a chance and go for something new. What can I say? It was one of the best cuts I've ever gotten and he couldn't have been a nicer dude, so down to earth and hilarious! If I'm ever back in town I'll be stopping in to see him again, maybe even get a little date...eh? EH?!",positive
"i hadn't had a haircut in over a year- my ends were ridiculously dead and i had to basically pull out my hair every day when brushing it. i went to ginger for a cut and brows- i've been growing my hair out for over two years and wanted to keep as much length as possible and also wanted something simple since i don't own a hair dryer and have no desire to try and style it. she ended up cutting a little over an inch off and it looks and feels AMAZING! she checked with me through out every part of the cut and just put little layers in it and cut it dry, which i really prefer. i never felt pressure to buy product but ended up doing so since what she used was so awesome. now onto my brows- i tend to overdo my brows and have tweezed and waxed them to death. ginger did an awesome job and explained exactly what she was using and showed me them before she did anything further. overall, i am a HUGE fan- well worth the money and will be returning for regular cuts and brows!",positive
I got my hair hacked at another salon and was in desperate need for hair repair. I was working late on a Saturday and Hair Pollution was the only salon I could find that stayed open after 6pm. I called to book an appointment and they booked me with Amber. The hair salon isn't in the best neighborhood but I wasn't scared for my well being. The interior design inside is really funky and reminded me of something you would find in LA. Amber listened to my story about the bad experience I had at another salon and assured me she could fix the damage. She started off by washing my hair and gave me the best head massage ever! After that we discussed how I style my hair and what I'm looking for. I am very happy with my new do and I'll be back to see Amber. She rocks!,positive
"I have lived in such style capitals as Paris, London, LA and NYC. Never have I been asked to give my credit card over the phone to reserve an appointment or come in ahead of time to put a cash deposit down. Ridiculous! I understand that no-shows are a problem for many salons but this is the quickest way to alienate potential clients.",negative
"Too bad, close by and after reading other reviews just called and tried to book an appointment and couldn't. Not a big fan of giving out my name, phone number, and credit card to someone I've never met or a place I've never been...",negative
"Since I just moved to the valley from Chicago, I wasn't sure where to go. I made sure I checked out the reviews on Yelp before I would trust any salon to touch my hair. None of the salons in my neighborhood had good reviews, so I expanded my search. Hair Pollution popped up on my search and had awesome reviews so I figured I'd give it a shot. I came in as a walk in today for a partial high light and was able to be seen. Danae did an amazing job. My hair looks and feels amazing! The place is definitely interesting on the inside. Not your typical spa-feel salon, it totally works! Reasonably priced and great work will make me a returning customer!",positive
"Tad and his staff are amazing. A friend convinced me to finally try Hair Pollution after she continually came to work with gorgeous and creative styles. I had recently had hair trauma so was very leery of anything at all. After 8 months of not allowing anyone to touch my hair I followed her in. I am so so Soooo glad I did. Tad knew exactly what had gone wrong in my previous cut and color, how to remedy it and I left feeling and looking like a million bucks. I have never had so much fun at a salon either. The scalp massage alone was worth going. I also found the price for services incredibly fair. I cannot wait to go back!!! Faith in humanity restored. ;)",positive
"I've been back to see Samantha again and the compliments about my hair have not let up. She's friendly, fast and great conversation. Oh yeah, she does a great job cutting hair too. I love this salon with its funky vibe and cool art. Make a point of checking it out if you are fortunate enough to live in CenPho.",positive
"Samantha is great! I just moved here from Portland and was really sad to leave my awesome stylist there. But Samantha definitely rose to the expectations that my Portland stylist had spoiled me with. And the added bonus was, some dude honked at me on the way home, and basically said, your hair looks amazing.Yup, crazy stuff like that happens sometimes! Thanks Samantha for a great cut!",positive
"I decided to try this place because I attended a fashion show where this salon donated their services. I was so impressed with the quality of hairstyles I had to check it out. This is my favorite salon in the Valley. It's got such a fun and friendly vibe. I have been there several times and tried several stylists. Every single one of them was fantastic, friendly, and willing to show me different ways of styling. The shampoo experience is reason enough to come here. They massage your head forever! :) I actually fell asleep once. They take their time cutting and don't rush me out every time. I usually go in never knowing what I want and LOVE every haircut I get there. It's always something different and modern. I've been to places like Dolce where the stylist couldn't wait for me to leave as soon as I arrived, was unfriendly, and gave me a basic cut that looked straight out of 1998. This place doesn't disappoint. Give a try, it will be worth it. The prices are comparable to other salons, their cuts are a bit cheaper than what I've seen at other salons too. Love it!",positive
"This place is the best, hands down... I give much LOVE and respect for Tad the owner, he cuts hair like no one else i know in the world..His hands move in a way so fast you cannot even see thim, Tad scissorhands of the business! I used to work for him, when the place was by the library back in the day.. He was sweet, caring, amazing, and taught me a lot... He runs a business like he would love his family, deeply.. All the other ppl i worked with were sweet an warm as well.. I say go, an tell ALL your friends, your hair will love you, everyone will wanna be you and you will feel sexy as hell... Plus it is a fun place to be, lots to look at...My kinda place hands down..",positive
"Best hair color and cut I have ever had. Samantha is fantastic. I've never had red highlights that I've loved, but these were it. And I went in there with very vague ideas of what I wanted done, and she went with them and did a great job. The ambiance is awesome too - always neat artwork on the walls and interesting music. Prices are reasonable, too.",positive
I took my teenage daughter for a haircut today at Hair Pollution. She is thrilled with her cut and could not have been happier. WayCool aka Hair Pollution is an awesome shop. We researched other salons before choosing this one and I am so glad we went there. So many salons are about promoting themselves and who and what they know. This salon is about getting the job done without all the fluff. Chris did an amazing job and took a ton of time perfecting her cut. The salon has a cool artsy vibe that doesn't usually exist in Phoenix. We will definitely return again in the future.,positive
"Ive gone to WayCool for years now for mulitple reasons whether its a getting my hair done for a photoshoot or for my own personal cut. CHRIS always cuts my hair beautifully. Last time I went in, I didnt have a precise idea what I was going to do with my long red locks. My hair was so long, I had to make a change, and cut at least 7 inches off. I was so worried because of past experiences Ive had with other salons. Chris saved the day not only getting me to cut all the 7 inches, which I knew I had to but definitely didnt want, and combined my style with what would actually work with my face shape. Everyone loved it just as much as I did. Even when he styles my hair for photoshoots, his creativity never ceases to amaze me. Along with Darci as well.... Ive only worked with her once for a shoot but she did a wonderful job. Needless to say, everyone at WayCool know exactly what theyre doing with this great alternative feel that Phoenix doesnt have in salons anywhere. OH! AND THANK YOU FOR GOING BUMBLE&BUMBLE on us. BEST DECISION YOU GUYS MADE!",positive
"I never really like getting my hair done by strangers, but it turned out I was going to the wrong places. Way Cool Hair Pollution is a really fun salon that has a hip and arty ambiance without being snobby. The stylists are meticulous and know what they are doing. The first time I went, my sister who has been a hair stylist for years tagged along, and even she said she was impressed by the result and the process. I've had appointments with Julia and Darcy, and they both did a really great job on the cut. I was a little more pleased with how Darcy was able to style my hair which is curly underneath and straight on top. She did these little twists between her fingers and then used the diffuser to dry. It was the first time I didn't step out of a salon with either straightened hair (I never straighten my hair), or 1980s crunchy curls. The curls were perfectly formed but still looked natural, and it's something I can easily emulate at home. I will definitely be coming back and have already recommended it to a friend who also loved it. The prices are semi-reasonable. I've paid the same at places like Ulta and JCPenney salon and the results aren't half as good.",positive
"I've finally found a stylist that fits me! Darci! She's very friendly, unpretentious, and laid back. More importantly, she was able to give me the cut I wanted. My previous stylist got close, but my cuts just didn't have the finishing touches that I wanted. Darci was able to pick up on those, though. She did a great job working with my fine, limp hair.",positive
"Anyone who knows anything about me knows that I could very well be the most picky person when it comes to my hair and who cuts it!!! I discovered this salon, and Chris Phillips purely by accident one day when I decided to accompany a friend to her hair appt. I was a few weeks away from a scheduled hair appt with someone else but asked for an impromptu trim up to get me through. It was then that I met Chris. He gave me what a I'll call a mini-hair shape up but he did such a fabulous job, that I ended up cancelling my appointment with my regular stylist. I just had my first full cut and color appointment with Chris and he is a brilliant stylist!!! Both the cut and color are right on--he did a beautiful job!! My hair is short and fine.....and I can never find someone who can really texturize my hair the way I like it! I'm waking up every day now with a smile, having good hair days!!!! Chris and Way Cool get my highest praise!! :) I plan to be his newest loyal client!!",positive
Best salon in Arizona. I've been going there three years and counting. They always have the best stylist hard at work (specifically Stephanie and Samatha). These are some of the coolest people you'll meet. The owner Tad is the man and also a great stylist. Hair Pollution is by far one of the most unique and artistic establishments I've ever seen. Thumbs up from me! -@!,positive
"Well, I was going to give Megan a rave review, but I see someone else has already done it for me! She did a great job - I am really pumped about my hair now. She was also really easy to talk to. :) The salon itself is a really cool space. They had a DJ there - Megan said they always do on Saturdays. I think I've found my salon. :)",positive
"I was in Phoenix on a never ending business trip that forced me to cancel my hair appointment with my usual Boston stylist. Well after perusing Yelp to find a salon that could fit both of my requirements, funky interior and stylists with tattoos, I came upon Hair Pollution. I called and got an appointment with Megan the same day. She turned out to be really nice, easy going, and the best stylist I have ever had. Once I got back home everyone was complimenting my hair even my sister who never hides her disdain of my short dew. And since I am completely vain, my next business trip to Phoenix is going to have to take place when I need another hair cut.",positive
Best eyelash extension experience I've ever had here in Vegas! Yui is a pro and super gentle throughout the whole thing so much that I had the best nap I've had in a while. To wake up refreshed after a hard hot day at work freshly lashed by Yui's flawless work was the best feeling ever! I would definitely recommend her to anyone.,positive
"I highly recommend this place. I got eye lush here. It was awesome and really pretty. Yui, She's gonna explain everything so even if you're first time to do it, there is no worry.",positive
Got my hair done by Yota and I love it. He is gentle on the hair and really takes his time to make sure he has all the details right.,positive
Really nice place. I have been looking for right place to get my hair done for long time. I think I finally find the one. I just got my cut and color done. I'm really happy with result Nice Japanese and Korean stylist. Highly recommend. Everyone is really nice and friendly. I'm sure I'll be back. And next time I'll try their eyelash extensions that my friend recommended at same place,positive
"I'm so glad to found the best eyelash place in vegas finally. This is the best go to place for lashes. It was my first time here, all the staffs are so kind and helpful. They sent me some notices before I get there, and it was so helpful as well. Yui-my lash artist-was so nice, careful and friendly. They do have many detail options(length, curl, shape, and style), so the lashes are fit so well for my eyes. It looks flawless, and I can't feel any inconvenience by getting extensions. It's super light and natural. During the procedure, I felt so comfortable and even I can tell she's caring me a lot. By the time I left the shop, all the staffs were very attentive. I would DEFINITELY come back here again!!!!!!!",positive
"It was my first time at ViVi. So I was little bit nervous But My artist yui she was very nice and friendly, great customer service she explained everything I need. Made me very comfortable and relax. And she did great job!! I absolutely love my lashes! I definitely recommend this place!",positive
It was my second time to visit Vivi and this place is my favorite hair cut & eyelash place in Las Vegas so far. I enjoyed the amazing service by Yota and Yui. Customer service there was absolutely fantastic. I would definitely like to come back again :),positive
I had a great experience at Vivi! I got my eyelashes done by Yui. She explained everything in great detail and took her time to understand my needs. They use great products and are very professional. They really excel in their skills. I have been to other lash places but Vivi exceeded all of my expectations. I'm very happy with Vivi and I definitely recommend this place.,positive

"Shelley Hunt is amazing! I go to her regularly and would never go anywhere else. I have naturally thick and course hair. She does my cuts, color and keratin consistently great",positive
I love Shelley. She does an amazing job. She's gotten my hairstyle exactly right. She totally knows what she is doing. I will be returning.,positive
"I found Shelly doing a research of best colorists in Las vegas, I was able to check out her pictures and Love her coloring jobs,She really listened and talked to me threw the steps she was doing. I brought in a picture of how I wanted my hair and she gave me what I wanted! I will be returning to her from now on!",positive
"Shelley is amazing she did the brazillian keratin straightening on my hair, and it came out awesome I love my hair. The treatment left my hair silky smooth and smells so good. I found Shelley on a Craigslist ad and I haven't been to a salon in 11 years, she is such a great person. She is a people person and very good to talk to. She loves her job, and I must say her work speaks for itself. I know who I will be going to and that's Shelley. If you are looking for an amazing stylist she is it. Thank you so much Shelley, it was so great to have met you. I will be seeing you in 3months. Love Dee",positive
"I found Shelley on groupon and have stuck with her since! Brazilian blowout, haircuts, and a Beachy wave perm all done perfectly! I love how good of a listener she is and she is a true perfectionist - a great quality in a stylist! She's spunky and fun so the time flies! Def recommend!",positive
"Shelley is an outstanding stylist. For the past two years, she has cut, colored and highlighted my hair. I have always been delighted with her work and receive many compliments on my cut and color. She listens to what you want and always makes appropriate recommendations. She is creative and gives expert suggestions for hair color that works with your skin tone, etc., and haircuts that fit your lifestyle. Shelley has a great sense of humor and we always share a few laughs together. Make an appointment to see Shelley--you won't be disappointed.",positive
"I am so upset. I got to my appointment 10 early. There was no receptionist at the front. Five minutes later both receptionists come out, say Hello and offer me a coffee (i declined). At no time did they notify my stylist that I was waiting. Instead I got to overhear their gossip about how the salon should be under investigation. After 10 minutes of waiting, I said that maybe I should change my appointment because they obviously over booked my stylist. The one receptionist said, ""no she doesn't wear her pager, we knew she'd be upfront."". That's when I got upset. I was about to walk out the door and the chatty gossip said, ""please don't leave"" and my stylist came out, apologized, and paid for my appointment. Do not go there unless you are in desperate need of gossip, and in desperate need of being ignored. I was a loyal customer for 2 years, and have never been treated like I was invisible.",negative
Don't bother going here unless you want to encounter extremely unprofessional workers and a rude manager to deal with if not satisfied.,negative
"Hop aboard the gossip train if you choose to go to Illusions ! The owner and several employees are completely phoney and unprofessional by gossiping behind PAYING customer's backs. No thank you, I left high school along time ago... choosing to take my $60 dollars elsewhere. All aboard !!!",negative
"Illusions is great. I have been twice while in the area and like the results. As a rule, I'm picky about my hair but I have yet to leave upset! They don't chop off 4 inches and claim it was just two, plus no surprises on prices. My only complaint would be that I always seem to be booked for a cut and style, even when I ask for just a cut and scheduled the latest possible time. The stylist always understands but it is frustrating to keep explaining ""just a cut.""",positive
"Drove past and saw this place, didn't have an appointment and they took me right before they closed. Got a hair cut by Nicole. Was more than pleasantly surprised. She did a great job. Cut off the perfect amount of hair for it to feel healthy again but still kept the length. We talked about color, and a funky cut, but she was very honest about what's best for my hair. (It was in pretty bad shape when I came in). The hair cut was perfect, but the honesty/conversation about how to get where I want with my hair is what will make me a consistent customer. Thanks Nicole!",positive
"Very nice staff. I haven't gotten a hair cut in a year and a half just because I never could find the guts to trust anyone with my hair. I finally went to illusion unlimited and got a hair cut from Marnie. She is just great,helpful and honest. She did exactly what I wanted to be done with my hair. I highly recommend her.",positive
"I love Illusions! I've been coming here for ~8 years now. For the past couple of years, Kelly has been my go to stylist. She always delivers! I get somewhat of a complex color, a deep purple tone. We moved out of state for a year, and between 4 stylists not a single one could compare to what she does! With all of my out of state stylists, I was paying almost double and my color would fade within a week. My color with Kelly lasts for ages and always looks spectacular, I get compliments on it all the time even when it's faded out. I'd highly recommend her, but you can't go wrong with any of the ladies here and if I was in a tight pinch there's several back up ladies who I'd trust as well.",positive
"It's really amazing what a single salon visit can do to improve your appearance. My visit was worth every penny. A woman named Sharron gave me an eyebrow wax and did an AMAZING job and actually put forth a lot of effort to get them perfect--no one else I've had did them with that much attention to detail. My haircut was fairly quick, but it worked wonders and I'm glad I got it. Hair looks much healthier now.",positive
"Nice decor, great selection of products, an array of stylists. I love Kara! She's so personable and you feel at ease with her. Wonderful hospitality is offered to all.",positive
"My sister set up an appointment here for her wedding with the bridal party. We arrived around 8am and the staff was friendly and accommodating with a nice cup of coffee. Honestly, I was kind of in crabby mood that morning, because I had no idea what to with my hair or if anything really formal could be done with it. My hair wasn't long enough, at chin length for an up-do like everyone else. After some brainstorming, my stylist began putting bigger curls in my hair and playing around with different options. Unfortunately, I can't remember my stylist name, but after some time she came up with an AWESOME style. I felt very vava-voom Elizabeth Taylor circa 1960's. They were even able to fit me in last minute to get my make up done too. I was so happy with how everything turned out, I truly felt like a rock star when I left. I got so many compliments at the wedding and it's all due to the great staff here!",positive
"I LOVE this hair!!! Not only is the hair amazing, Kallie was a joy to work with. I was so indecisive but she was patient and took her time explaining the various types of hair (no matter how many times I asked the same questions). I have purchased hair from various places throughout Charlotte, but the quality of hair and professionalism of this establishment is top notch. Now that I've found this spot, I will never buy hair from anywhere else!",positive
I have gotten a few pieces from Indique and I absolutely LOVE it every time ! The hair is consistent and the customer service is immaculate!!! I love the girls in there ! Very knowledgeable about their products !! I'd definitely recommend this company to anyone who's looking for great quality hair !,positive
"I have purchased hair at Indique twice now and have not been let down either time. The hair is amazing quality and can be used multiple times. It even better than the hair, is the service that Indique Charlotte provides. Callie is a super friendly, very knowledgeable and helpful consultant. After our first purchase, she checked in to make sure our purchase was holding up to our expectations. Prior to our second purchase, I called Callie and told her when we were coming and what we were looking for. When we arrived at the store, she had pulled everything we needed to see and ready for us to look at. Her service and kind demeanor is beyond appreciated. We will continue to come back to Indique!",positive
"I love this hair, I have been introduced to this hair at a young age and was convinced that this is the only hair I should be getting because it's long lasting and you will get what you pay for. Kallie is the best associate, she's very knowledgeable about the hair and how you should take care of it",positive
I have known about Indique hair for a long time. I finally came into the local boutique to purchase hair for my next install. I had a great experience and Kallie was extremely helpful and knowledgeable. Looking forward to getting this hair installed.,positive
"Ok first, the receptionist was on her phone and sitting with her feet up when I came in. Didn't greet me until I stared at her for a good minute at the desk. Got signed in and waited for 20 minutes with nobody in line. Don't come here for mani/pedi, as the students are more trained with hairstyling even though they provide different services like facials, mani/pedi/, waxing etc... I got a great shampoo, deep condition, haircut and blow dry from Felis for $12! She took her time and was really personable. The mani/pedi package wasn't as great because you sit in this awkward tile stage and the student sits uncomfortably on a stool. They also aren't trained with using tools that dig into your toes like other nail salons so my feet don't feel as clean. I come home and the nail polish had already chipped, I could've done it myself. You get what you paid for I guess. They lost 2 stars because of customer service and their lame nail salon set up! Tsk tsk!",negative
"OMG! I am soooo happy I found this beauty school. I have gone to many beauty schools but this one is THE BEST. Why you may ask? Well first off, the prices are unbeatable. You won't find cheaper at any other school-PROMISE. Second, it looks like a beautiful salon inside. You cant tell that it is even a school. Beautiful inside. Third, the student I had named Alanna gave me the best flat iron I have EVER had. That includes all professional services (and I am from Los Angeles-include them too). Wow. I was so impressed. I paid $13 for a shampoo and flat iron. Mind you my hair is down to my waist-no extra charge for long hair! I am SO happy I found this place. It is located in the Fiesta Mall which just adds to its greatness!!!! Go check it out!!! Their hours are great too! On Saturdays they are open until 5pm!",positive
"Had a manicure in the student clinic this morning. It is on the second floor of Fiesta Mall. It was only $7 for a basic manicure. The student did an excellent job and was very friendly. I was a walk-in, but they were able to take me right away. Two things kind of bothered me and kept this from being a 5 star experience: 1) One of the instructors was wearing hoop earrings the size of hula hoops and had a facial piercing. It just looked unprofessional and was the wrong image to model for her students. 2) On the floor, next to my feet, in the manicure area was a hair clip and few feet away was a clump of old hair. I know these are picky details, but it leaves the impression that faculty and students don't care about the details.",positive
"I probably get my hair cut like once a year because every time it's been disastrous but my visit here was very satisfactory!! All I wanted was long layers and angles and my stylist did just that. Was a bit nervous at first since it is a beauty school, but my hair turned out great! Shampoo, cut, and blowdry was only $7.50! Hell, I can't even get a burrito for that price.",positive
"I found this Beauty School on line. I looked up Beauty Schools in the neighborhood and this one came up. I called and made an appt. Three days later was my appt. Upstairs in Fiesta Mall. However, they had no record of my having an appt. But, just after a short wait I had a girl to do my hair. Samaria. She was a sweet girl who did a wonderful job on my hair. She was very careful and I was very pleased. Only $25.00,how could it get better than this! Good place to go to. The prices can't be beat. They even do mani pedi here as well. The parking is in the mall so there is a lot.",positive
"Kandice is amazing! I have super fine hair and came in with long, scraggly hair and told her to go darker (whatever she thought best) and do a blunt long bob cut. Absolutely amazing results. She's such a sweet person and made the whole experience an awesome one.",positive
"Was able to book my appointment the same week with Kandice and she did an amazing job. She inquired about what I wanted exactly and let me know my options during every the step of the process. I'm very picky when it comes to my hair, and she definitely took care of me. Highly recommend her.",positive
"I moved here 2 years ago from New York where I had lived all my life and being that I have had my hair done by the same person for 10 years was nervous about where I would get my hair done. My sister, a long time client of David's suggested I go to ISH. I have not been disappointed since! Everyone there is very competent and very nice. I myself started out with David doing my hair however one day could not get in with David and was offered to see Volila which I was happy to do. Volila is amazing at what she does, she takes her time and is precise. she goes over and above and takes her time to concentrate on who is in front of her. Besides, being good, I look forward to going into ISH to get my hair done becasue I can catch up with people who work there. Also, Hillary who is an esthetician at ISH is equally as amazing. I look forward to my appointments with Hillary just as much because not only is she knowledgeable but very very sweet. I would definitely recommend ISH to anyone needing a new salon.",positive
"I really wanted to like this place. I have used Yelp as a fairly credible resource in the past and this place had great reviews. New to the area, I came to Ish to get my hair cut and styled. The person I originally scheduled with had to cancel, but I went in and got a cut and style with another stylist. Shortly after, I returned to the salon because I was not satisfied with how the layers were falling in my long hair. I wanted them blended more. When I called to schedule the corrective cut, I was told that the owner could fit me in later in the week. I was very grateful. However, when I arrived, I was not in the books, but he did squeeze me in before his next appointment. We went over what needed amending and I felt heard. He was very friendly (so was the rest of the staff) and the atmosphere was pleasant. His next client came, however, and I could feel the urgency to finish with my cut/style. From here, I am honestly not sure what happened, but I left the salon with what is the worst haircut since my childhood. Though the layers were now blended in the back, a far worse problem was created. My front left side was SEVERELY uneven (see pictures). It's as if the scissors slipped and a huge chunk was cut out. When I saw my hair before I left, I was in shock and hopeful that it was just a wave/curl that was making things so uneven. I was extremely upset and could not bring myself to go in for a THIRD time. Ultimately, I had to find another salon (where I will go from now on) and pay full price for yet another haircut and style. Much to my despair, I have lost at least three and a half inches total off my length and paid for two haircuts. Again, though everyone was very nice, the final result and lack of professionalism are unacceptable. I am only writing this review with the hope that someone else can be spared from a mishap this large and costly.",negative
Everyone here is so friendly and they do amazing work! Candice is my personal favorite--she always has a smile on her face and she offers really helpful suggestions when I want to try different things. She never leads me astray! Would recommend to anyone of any age!,positive
Very classy place. I really like the way I am treated and the attention to details that Frank gives. I have been going here for over a year. Color match! Yes they get it right. Great for all ages young and old are welcome. They do not rush you though like the cheap hair cut places. One thing is I wish they were open in the evening... Appointments are necessary,positive
AMAZING!!!!!! I needed to have my hair fixed due to a previous attempt at some highlights. I am super picky about who does my hair and thought it couldn't get any worse. I called and spoke to Kandice and she suggested I come in for a consultation and then we can work from there. I came in and she said it wasn't as bad as she initially thought (I described something horrific on the phone) She said she could actually get me in right then. I think she could tell I was extremely nervous. She kept assuring me that she would not let me leave without being completely satisfied. She did more than deliver. She fixed my hair better then I could have expected. I absolutely love her and will definitely be a client of hers forever. The Salon was very upbeat and everyone seemed to be having a good time. Almost all of the stylists spoke to me in some way or another. When the owner left he personally thanked me for coming in and wished me a good night. It's very refreshing to go someplace new and have this great of an experience. Thank you Kandice for helping me and putting me at ease. I would highly recommend Kandice for your new stylist.,positive
"Frank did an amazing job! Love the cut and color is absolutely perfect! He listens, he counsels and he's very attentive to detail. My daughter was in town visiting recently and he gave her a great new color and style. I hightly recommend him!!",positive
"I was contacted by the new esthetician, Aurora, to come in & use the coupon that the front desk lady said I couldn't. After a bit of a wait she came & brought me back. Aurora was very friendly & did a thorough consult prior to my service. I decided on a body scrub/massage. She ended up treating me for well over an hour, gave me a mini facial & it felt great. She used the pressure I requested & checked on me throughout to make sure I was comfortable. The scrub felt & smelled amazing! The music & lighting was also great. I'd definitely recommend her!",positive
I went to ISH Salon after trying several other places in Phoenix and I couldn't be happier. TJ gave me an awesome haircut. He listened to what I wanted and made suggestions. It's the best haircut I have had in years. It's easy to take care of and looks great! Thank you so much!,positive
"Aurora is a mad genius. Look at my skin. Look at it! Enough said. Worth every penny, you won't want to go to anyone else",positive
"I love ISH!! Volila does my hair, and my mother taught hair in college so I'm hard to please, but she's AMAZING! I'm constantly getting compliments! The facial services are awesome too, Aurora is so knowledgeable!",positive
"Aurora is an amazing esthetician at Ish salon! I saw her for a collagen induction treatment and could not have been more impressed. She is kind, compassionate and enthusiastic about helping you reach your goals! one visit with Aurora and you will not only be relaxed, but have a new understanding for your skins condition. book an appointment with her today for an outstanding experience!!",positive
"I received the most amazing body treatment from AURORA! She is friendly, knowledgeable, and absolutely incredible!! She spends time with you and explains everything to where you can understand! I highly recommend her for massage, body treatments, and facials!! She is the absolute best! Thank you to Aurora for making me feel amazing!! Everyone call and book with her!! You won't regret it!!",positive
"Jo did my color and David did the cut. Both were awesome! I went from professionally colored red, to home color brown (twice to cover the red) and Jo was able to give me exactly what I wanted! She took her time and fixed my hair. David's cut was also great! I'm so glad to have found my forever hair home!",positive
"This place is like Cheers! After a couple of visits, everyone knows your name and it's like one, big, happy family! David has changed me from boring to stylish - very gently pointing me in the right direction and keeping me in my comfort zone. The color is brilliant and I am no longer stuck in the 90's. : ) Hilary is another gem - her facials do amazing things that you didn't even know you needed done. My skin feels fabulous after one of her treatments and it's a great break in this crazy life. Love this place!!",positive
I absolutely loved going to Ish salon! David made my hair beautiful and was so fun visiting with too! I live too far for regular visits but highly recommend Ish!,positive
Becky did a terrific color and trim for me. I love it! She seemed to sense what I like and was tactful with suggestions. I would trust her.,positive
"After years of going to different stylists I finally found David, who ""got it right"". He suggested coloring my hair, then highlighting over that, instead of just highlights which I had always had done. He also suggested a different cutting technique that brought out the best in my naturally wavey, thick hair. The result is a beautiful rich color with depth that looks natural, and a cut that I can style in a variety of ways with different tools, or just run my fingers through it in the morning and I'm good to go! I work in a public environment and EVERY day I get compliments on my hair. I highly recommend David to everyone.",positive
"Ryan has cut my hair for years and by far they are the best haircuts I have ever had! I never have to worry about what I'm going to get. Every time I go in everyone is so friendly and welcoming, I always have I great experience! I would recommend Ryan to anyone who wants to have the best haircut of their life.",positive
"Worst haircut ever. First time I liked the style, but cut was not even. Went second time and never again. Came home to fix my bad cut...she didn't even check lengths. One side way too long. Goodbye Ish. Wasted a lot of good money.",negative
Love Ish Salon! Jo is a wonderful stylist and colorist. She has colored and styled my hair for the past 4 years and my hair has never looked better. Thank you Jo and Ish Salon,positive
"Thank you Becky for your excellent service! My hair was long, dry and lifeless. A color and cut at Ish fixed it all and I'm one very happy new customer. Becky was friendly, professional and did a great job! The salon was spotless, inviting and relaxing. So happy to find this place!",positive
I wanted to write a review because I started my appointment off very anxious trying a new place. After about 10 minutes of talking to Jo Jo she definitely helped me feel more at ease right away. She listened to me and my concerns and took everything I said and applied it. Going super blonde is always scary but she did an amazing job! Thank you so much for taking the time and making my hair look great!,positive
"I love this place and the vibe. If you get a chance, book an appointment with Becky! I use to go to places where they'd over cut my hair in all of 5 minutes. Those days are over! Becky is incredibly friendly, talented, and amazing at what she does. Leave it to her to make you feel brand new whether it's cut, color, and/or style! I'm always leaving the place feeling beautiful!",positive
"I've been going to Ryan for about 7 months and I'm always very happy with his work. He's very nice, talented, and always makes me laugh! I referred 2 close friends of mine to Ryan, both of them absolutely love him, and became regular clients. As I cannot speak for any of the other stylist at ISH, I CAN tell you the staff has always been very nice and professional. Being relatively new to the area, I'm so happy to have found Ryan when I did, he's a pleasure to be around! Thank you :)",positive
"I am sorry I have not written a review before now. David is as good as it gets!! He is so accommodating, fun, and he knows his stuff!! Every time I go in he turns down the house music and makes me sing to his clients ( I'm not shy, so it's ok...lol) I always leave looking fabulous, feeling refreshed and still have money in my purse as Ish Salons is very affordable! Thank you Andrew, Frank, David and the rest of the staff for making me feel so comfortable and welcome!",positive
"I went to Ish salon to see Ryan for the first time about six months ago, when I walked in I noticed it was very clean, fun and had a very welcoming atmosphere. When I sat down I explained to Ryan how I have been having trouble finding a stylist that can meet my high expectations for both cut and color. After a brief consultation, Ryan then told me that he knew exactly what he was going to do and assured me that I was going to love it. Well, he was right!! Not only did he do an outstanding job with my color (that no one else could seem to master) he complimented it with an impeccable precision haircut (all for what I would consider a very fair price!) I left the salon feeling confident and couldn't wait for my next appointment. Ryan was very confident, genuine and comforting, explaining his history as a ""4th generation Hair Stylist"", he understood how nerve wracking it could be going to a new stylist for the 1st time. Ryan made it an overall wonderful experience. He dresses ""hip"" and and has a very colorful personality. I then sent my husband to him that very same week who gets a very technical fade and was tired of going to these cheep cost-cutters/sports clips places and having to walk around embarrassed for the next 3-4 weeks. Ryan did it again, he nailed it! My husband has never been so happy, explaining to me how well Ryan was able to fade his hair and flawlessly blend it into the top! Is there anything he can't do!? my husband is now a regular and so am I! 5 stars for Ish Salon and especially this very talented young man!",positive
I have known dave awhile and he is superb. He is a visionary on how to cut your hair. He listens and is great! This salon gets 5 stars.,positive
"Ish Salon in Ahwatukee is top notch! It's not very often you find an upscale salon that is still down to earth. I was intimidated when I walked in but it didn't take long for the front desk person to ask me if I needed anything. Very nice people here! But before I go on I would be remiss not to mention Frank! What a great guy! I received an awesome haircut at an affordable price. Not only is he talented but he is available. He will work extra hours to make sure his clients are taken care of. Call him! Oh and yes... the owner's son was the crazy guy on MTV's hit show ""Real World"" last season:)",positive
"I have been following Ursa, arguably the best stylist in town, for a while now. I am glad she has her own place. She is very talented especially with hair color and is meticulous. Never rushes you and always remembers your style and preferences.",positive
"Kate cut my hair. She was very polite and cut my hair just like I wanted, if not better. The salon is small, but it is nice and comfy. I've been looking for a place to cut my hair on campus for a long time and I found it.",positive
It's been 4 months since I came Champaign and I was looking for a salon. Jaivika salon is by far the best among the salons I have tried. Ursa is really nice and professional. It feels like she really knows what she is doing and that's the thing I was looking for. The price could seem a little bit high but it is definitely worth it. I highly recommend this salon for those who is looking for a better hair cut.,positive
"Jillanna has been my go-to stylist for years. She is amazing! I always leave with a cut I love. She's bleached my hair several times and I've never had breakage. She's dyed my hair blue, purple, and red for me, and I've always loved how it's turned out. The salon itself is small but clean and comfy, and its close to campus. I will be going to Jillanna for my styling as long as I live in the area!",positive
"After searching for a over a year for a salon and stylist, I finally found Jaivika Salon and Jillana! I love that the dye is ammonia free and that they value diversity. Jillana encouraged me to go REALLY red during our initial consultation and while I was a bit nervous, I've been in love with my hair ever since. I highly recommend Jillana and Jaivika Salon, and I'm so happy I finally have a dependable stylist in the C-U area!",positive
"Jessica is such a great stylist! She is a very knowledgeable and skilled artist. Not to mention is down to earth, very personable and big on using all organic products. This was my first cut and balayage color with her, but she really exceeded my expectations! My hair looks great and the products I bought from her are amazing. Again all organic-and because she knows so much about her products she matched me with the perfect shampoo & conditioner that has made my hair stay silky smooth. Best of all it didn't cost a ridicules amount like most stylist try to sell you. All in all she was honest, took pride in her work, made sure to let me know If I didn't like anything she would fix it, and has a real positive vibe about her. Thanks again Jessica. I'll be seeing her again for sure.",positive
Jess is by far the best hairdresser I've ever gone to. I absolutely refuse to use anyone else now since she started doing my hair 4 years ago.,positive
Very pleased:) I used a Groupon for cut and high lights. I was in and out in an hour and a half and as a mom that was perfect! I love my hair right now and will definitely be back to see Jessica.,positive
"Jessica is the absolute best at what she does. I say this for a few different reasons: 1. She genuinely cares about you and the integrity of your hair. Huge points in my book because some hair dressers run their business like an assembly line and only care about the money. 2. Her personality shines. She makes you feel like she's known you for years, and makes the time go by fast by talking to you and making you laugh. (Nothing worse than sitting in a chair for two hours in pure silence) 3. Her work is AMAZING. Jessica has many specialities and is master at her craft in every way, but her color is untouchable. She even uses a color line called ""All Nutrient"" which is natural, and all organic for people who have color allergies or sensitivities. Overall, I give Jessica a 10/10 and would recommend anyone to see her!",positive
"Jess is amazing! I've been going to her for 10 years. She's always so helpful when I'm not sure what I want to do but I need a change. She's honest, and so sweet!",positive
"Great place and Jess is nothing short of perfection. It's a very pleasant experience. I've recommended many clients to her, all with amazing reviews too.",positive
"Jessica Taylor is amazing!! She can work magic and makes you look and feel so stunning. She has truly mastered the art of hair color, cuts and style. You won't find anyone better!!!! And her super fun personality will make your visit seem like you are having an outing with your best friend!!! Prepare to have fun and laugh. I just can't say enough great things about Jessica. I won't go anywhere else!!!",positive
"I have been coming to Jess for years! She takes great care of my hair. After moving to Vegas my hair became damaged and broke off really short. Since then, she has grown my hair out and now it is down to my belly and so healthy! I highly recommend her. Her products leave my hair so silky smooth and shiny.",positive
"Found Jessica through groupon and couldn't be any happier! She was so nice and sweet and made me feel so comfortable. The whole experience with her was great and felt like it was hanging out with a friend. She did a trim and colored my hair and it turned out way better than I could imagine. She worked with me to get the results I was aiming for and explained everything I asked. In the 3 hours she was doing my hair, I could tell that she's a hard worker and incredibly talented. I have finally found my hair person and recommend her to all my family and friends, can't go wrong with Jessica :)",positive
"Jessica has been taking great care of my 2 kids and myself for over 8 years. She always seems to find a way to get us in, usually at the last minute. Don't waste your time going anywhere else. Book your appointment with ASAP.",positive
"Jessica is the best! My wife and I have been loyal customers for the past 8 years now. Jess is so friendly and great to talk to. She really knows her craft and I've never had a complaint. She's pretty darn good at making my wife super beautiful with her exceptional styling and coloring skills. I highly recommend Jessica she's definitely one of the best hairstylists in Vegas. +1 extra star for awesomeness, 6 stars!",positive
"Jessica is amazing!!! She is also one of the nicest people I know. She has always listened to my crazy request and will tell me honestly if it's something I should do to my hair. She is sweet,honest and talented!! I would highly recommend her to anyone who has a passion for their hair because she does not disappoint!!",positive
There are just not enough good things I can say about Jessica!! I always come out of her chair feeling and looking like a million bucks! She has a knack for creating the right look for me!!! She is extremely talented in her field!,positive
"Jessica is an incredibly talented and creative hair stylist. Her work is always BEAUTIFUL and she has exceeded every expectation when it comes to color. If you want to find a stylist who is amazing at color, she is your girl! She has such a lovely personality and is always a joy to talk to. Thanks Jess!!",positive
"Where do I start?! This girl is hands down THE BEST hairdresser I've ever had! Not just because of her amazingly sweet personality but she really does know what she's doing and is very knowledgable when it comes to product! Some hairdressers are good with short hair and some with long but not Jess. Jessica can do everything!!!! I started going to Jess back in 2008 when she was at Too Hotties on Eastern. Of course once she left I had to follow her. Ive never met a more caring and sweet individual in my entire life. I moved to Seattle in 2009 and have struggled to find anyone even remotely close. I travel to Vegas 1-2 times a year and I always go see Jess for my haircut and color while in town. She even came to Seattle once and cut my hair in her hotel bathroom! I mean, what hairdresser do you know that would do that?! Not too many, Im sure. I highly highly recommend Jessica! I promise, you won't be disappointed!",positive
"First off, they get 5 stars for the quality of work. The ladies here are legit. They all speak in their native tongue while working, and the place was busy. My coworker gets her braids done here and they cane highly recommended. They get 2 stars for service, because I waited an hour and 15min to get my braids done when i called ahead and was told I would wait no longer than 30min. I had a flight to catch so by the time i got In a chair i had to settle for 2 box braids instead of the 6 cornrows i wanted. She was quick and my braids are beautiful, just not what i wanted. I do plan on giving them a second chance based on the quality, hopefully i get an accurate wait time.",negative
"One of the most unprofessional places I have been to. I was referred to this salon for my daughter. The first time I went, was before our baptism of our children. She said via text that she could do what my daughter asked for. SHE could do, when we got there we got someone else and they were speaking another language, pointing to my daughters hair and laughing. Needless to say, I won't post the pictures of our baptism because I hate the way her hair looks. The week after the hair was replaced by Kiki herself and it looked great. The second time I went was for individual braids for my daughter. Didn't do a bad job on them. But told me whenever I need a touch up for them to text her. I did, and she never responded. I wrote to her on 6 different occasions. She wrote me back ""when you want"" and when I responded with 4 options, I never heard back. Apparently a touch up isn't worth her time. Find someone else please! Talk to a wall, that's the service you'll get from Kiki",negative
"Its Not Too Many People Who Can Actually Braid In Las Vegas.I Have Been Going To Kiki's For A Couple Of Years And Never Been Disappointed.I Am Very Inpatient And Tender Headed.I Hate Getting Braids Because It Takes So Long,But I Always Get The Box Braids For $160 And Im In And Out In 4 1/2 Hours.Yes They Do Talk In African,And They Very Well Might Be Talking About The Customers But I Really Dont Care I Just Go Get My Hair Done And Mind My Buisness Lol.I Recommend Going Here",positive
I've been going here for over a year. Its my favorite braid shop. I recently had an appointment at 0800 and Kiki was there at 7:45. She went over hair options for my style and it turned out great!,positive
"I have to do an update. The last hairstyle that i told you about- when they braided my daughters hair. No weave added just her own hair.. I took it down and there were two bald spots in her head from where it was braided too tight. My poor baby. Sighhh..Now im afraid to take her ANYWHERE. This sacrred me...and her too. If you want to be bald headed and dont mind them pulling your hair out,go here.",negative
"They were awful. I had only one appointment with them and it was terrible. The service was rude, kiki constantly left from doing my hair to go do whatever else she was doing, she yelled at me when I told her she was hurting my head, she told me it would cost 50 dollars more than what I was originally quoted and to top if off, she was an hour and a half late to my appointment with no apology and didn't even start doing my hair when she got there, she sent someone else to do it. When I told her the lye in the synthetic hair was hurting me, she rudely insisted that it was not her fault and yelled at me for telling her that it caused caustic burns to my scalp. This is an absolutely horrible business. They should be shut down.",negative
"I have been to this shop a total of three times, each time seemed to be worst than the last. It seems like every time my daughter goes to get her hair done we have a problem there. The person they pick don't want to do her hair, they are rude. This last time they put three people doing her hair she was visibly uncomfortable and they showed no concern whatsoever. We will never go back there and I wish everyone luck for those that have had a good experience that is great. We had a horrible experience and will not recommend this place to no one not even enemies",negative
"I wish I had thoroughly read the reviews before going there. Too bad Yelp doesn't have ""0"" stars or negative stars because this shop would surely get that type of rating. I paid $180 for plain ol' box braids and stated that I wanted them in a bun or top knot. I'm over 55 years old and didn't want anything cute, young or fancy ~ just an easy style that I can wear to the gym, do yoga and a little swimming every now and then. The 1st Braider was ""Elise"" and she was fabulous. The 2nd Braider was the Braider from hell. I had to tell her Repeatedly that the braids were too tight; she yanked my head around; wheeled my chair (with me sitting in it) into another chair repeatedly; was inattentive and when she was done they were not full braids but loose at the ends. When I asked her why couldn't braid it to the end she said she couldn't. Ok. Well, what about placing the hair into a bun. She said she couldn't do that either because the braids were too tight. Well, hello ... So you were very aware that the last 4 hours that I spent in your chair, indicating every 4 minutes that the braids were too tight was not made up or fabricated? What a joke. Don't go there! I've new to Las Vegas from Chicago and as a "" naturalista"" since forever, I'm not new to the braid/sew-in scene. They lost a good customer.",negative
"Kiki has a shop now! come over and get your hair done. She doesn't just braid,she weaves too. Quality work done in quick time! And my hair is always on point. She does it how ever I like! She does little kids too. No complaints from me ! Love Love Love! :-)",positive
First off let me say this is the 3 rd time I have been here. Let me start from my first visit when she first opened her business here at this location.... I was extremely happy I got micros that took 5 1/2 no longer than 6 hours. Kiki did not do my hair I was okay with that she had the two sisters do it I was very happy. I'm very picky on my hair ( I know hair I'm from the hair capital yes Detroit) LOL . I was told 180.00 for my micros that was fine I even gave a tip at this appointment. I came back in January 2015 to get box braids and I wanted a big bun I asked Kiki could she do it because I liked the wy she did the other persons hair she said yes. When I got there she parted my hair and left I asked where she was going and she said she was moving today I said okay but you said you were going to do my hair... Okay so I moved pass that... Then the ladies kept going back and forth about how much to charge me Kiki told me 180.00 again and the other lady was saying 200.00 they were trying to hustle me so I said okay I'm not going over 200.00 and that was their tip since they tried to play me and pissed me off because they didn't even put my hiar in a bun talking about it was going to hurt I said this is what I came for I know it's going to be tender... Okay so I left there unhappy plus those braids kept me having a headache because I don't know how to put it up in a bun.... So my final and last appointment was last week Friday I called a couple of days and asked Kiki again if she could do my hair and she said she would call me back when she got home to look in her book... She never called me back so I gave her the benefit and called back thinking maybe she got busy or lost my number in the mist. I called back and the lady said I could come in with Kiki I get there and Kiki has another client in her chair... I said okay maybe it's not meant for Kiki to do my hair.... But I saw the lady who usually does it sitting down and two other women I figured she would do it again instead she had a other lady like in her mid 50's (and who was all in my phone) start my hair I explained that I DIDNT want my edges braided or the back close to my neck for these are the areas that pull and fall out and would make me bald.... I don't do bald... Okay after telling her several times Kiki tells her and she starts speaking in their language which I felt they were talking about me... Kiki showed me how unprofessional she really is she kept rolling her eyes. I don't know if it's their culture but she has lost a customer. Also just know if you have two braiders if someone else comes in your going to lose a braider... It took this older lady 8 hours I had to leave my back was killing me so bad. And when I get some my edges are all braided I paid and walked out. Kiki yelled BYE to me ...not thank you ...do you like your hair nothing.... Simply rude I'm never going back and I wasn't going to write a review because I never want to stop anyone's blessing but I have lost 3 braids and I'm on vacation pissed. So I will leave it up to you to decide if you want to go there.,negative
"If all you want is to sit there and get your hair braided, and you don't care about roaches and those crusty feet being damn near on your lap, this is the place for you! These girls are so unprofessional from asking the customer to do runs for them (with no discount!) to not even acknowledging the fact that these roaches are everywhere!! Not only that but they will quote you a price and at the end tack on another $50!!! I hate this place, NEVER AGAIN! But on the bright side, my braids look nice ???",negative
Beware they will change the price when they finish. Very deceitful and unprofessional gondus. Beware of the braider named Agi. Horrible quality of work. What a waste of $100. She lied about the price said $50 and then said $100 at the end! Never again. Others seem to have the same problem as you can see here in the reviews.,negative
"Just moved to Vegas and needed my hair done for work, I researched around and this place is where I decided to take a chance on.... Never Again!!! She provides the hair and a sure me that the perm braiding hair would work on my Natural hair... im use to marley hair I've been going to Africans shop for 15 years never could I not sleep for threes cause the braids were so so tight... today is day six and my natural hair is showing through and the damn ends are coming down... if you care bout your hair, scalp care n your money Do Not Go to kiki... her prices is not right for the type of hair she uses and length... I am all for spending my money in Black Own businesses.... no more Chinese nail shops or Africans shops... for obvious reasons... can I get one great Black own business that can handle all my beauty needs",negative
"I was so blessed that she fit me in even though I called that same day. Then, I got confused and went to the wrong street... which caused me to be 30 min. late (so rude of me!) She was very kind & really really glad I went/Painless waxing!",positive
"Magdolna was wonderful! It is such a joy to talk with her, and her service is exceptional. I felt so comfortable during my appointment and was very happy with the waxing service she provided. I will definitely be returning! Five stars!",positive
Such a pleasure and one place I'd like to keep going to. So hard to find someone who enjoys and works hard at what they do!,positive
Magdolna is truly amazing!!!! She is so knowledgeable and takes pride in what she does!! I would highly recommend her and her sister if you are looking for a great wax!!,positive
"I absolutely ADORE Magdolna, even when she tortures me! My friends are always hesitant to get waxed, fearing that it will hurt. Well, it does, but only for a few minutes and then you are clean and hair free for weeks, months even! It's SO worth it! I've been going to Magdolna since I was 16 years old (I'm now 44) and I don't trust anyone else. She's amazing! I even drive from CA to Vegas to have her wax my legs! Give her (or her sister Juliana) a call! You won't be sorry (well, after the initial sting - hahah!!)",positive
Malgdona is amazing! Love her! Would never go anywhere else ever again! I highly recommend her or twin sister for any waxing facials ! You will love her!!!,positive
"The most amazing women in their field !!!. These two are the VERY BEST at what they do . I have been going to them for 16 years . And my mother has been going to then since the beginning, They are like family to me and have know me since I was a small child. They treat everyone with warmth and respect and are very professional but make you feel comfortable to express any concerns you have regarding waxing or skin etc.. Don't waist your time or money going anywhere else . Kiiss's Salon is worth any amount they charge. Invest in yourself and go to Kiss's . XOXOX Call to make an apt, they are usually booked and can only take small services walk ins.",positive
"I have been going to Julianna for over 20 years. She is efficient, professional and always does a wonderful job whether it is a wax or facial. She helped me clear up my blemishes many years ago. She and her sister, Magdolna, are caring and positive. I always look forward to my time with Julianna.",positive
I don't like waiting. My appointment was at 6. and I waited 30 min. When she did come out she was in conversation with another client and made me wait longer. I ended up leaving and she didn't even apologize. Don't know where all the good reviews are coming from!!!,negative
"I've been coming to Magdolna & Juliana for over 10 years now and I wouldn't go anywhere else for a Brazilian wax. These sisters were actually some of the first aestheticians in Las Vegas to offer this kind of waxing, and you can certainly tell that they know what they're doing! I've heard horror stories from people regarding Brazilian waxes, but I've always had a great (as great as that can be!) experience here. They are very professional, clean and quick-which is very important as you don't want to be there any longer than you need to be. ;) I never have stray hairs and I always leave happy. I highly recommend them for any waxing needs!",positive
I've been going to Magdolna for 4 years for all my waxing needs. I drive all the way from Summerlin just for her. She makes me feel very comfortable and makes everything as painless as possible. Both her and her sister are very professional plus they have the best sense of humor and the best prices. I won't go anywhere else!,positive
"I can't say enough about these two dynamic ladies. I've been going to them faithfully for more than 10 years now and can't imagine what I'd do if they stopped service! Not only are they the sweetest, kindest women but they are so very talented and really know their stuff. For those of you that get waxed, you know what I mean! If they aren't the best it shows! Want the highest quality work in a place where you feel comfortable (as comfortable as one can while getting waxed!) then visit Magdolna and Julianna at Kiss's Salon for all your waxing and facial needs. I promise you'll be hooked after 1 visit!",positive
"I go here only to get my bikini waxed. There are two of the cutest Hungarian old lady twins who do everything. There's not too many places cheaper in Vegas than $60 and the one I went to that was turned out to be pretty bad. I dunno which twin I get everytime but to me, the least painful bikini wax are the quickest ones. It seriously takes under 4 minutes. I always think there's gonna be stuff left behind but I look down and, whoa, it's all gone! They prefer cash and definitely call to make an appointment because they are always booked.",positive
"So the old salon I used to go to (not going to mention their name, but if you creep on my yelp, I'm sure you'll figure it out). I have been going to them for maybe about two years. My hair goal was always to be super ashy and blonde. After spending literally hundreds of dollars and never reaching my goals I decided to jump ship to LAB. I've been creeping on Lindsey's Instagram and loved loved loved her blonde work! So before leaving for vacation I decided to see if she can get me in for a tone and root touch up. Luckily, she was super flexible and was able to get me in. Wahoo, needless to say my hair turned out awesome! HOLD UP! Did I mention all of their products are vegan friendly even their coffee creamer! I look forward to going back to Lindsey to reach my Hair goals.",positive
"This salon is the definition of professionalism and personality! Jess, Lindsay and Carly are all wonderful! Jess does my hair and not only is her color game strong her extension services are on point as well. She took me from a terrible ombré bayalage to a gorgeous blonde with dimension! The whole team is extremely flexible and work around YOU not themselves! I highly recommend giving them a call for any service!",positive
I've been going to Jess for 2.5 years and she is the best hair dresser I've ever had. I had a bad color job when I first when to her and she corrected the reddish brown back to my natural color. Since then I've had multiple color treatments including balayage and regular hair cuts and she always gets it exactly right. Such a great stylist!! Her new salon is always beautiful and there is ample parking making it very convenient.,positive
I'm loving Lab salon + brow studio. I've known Jessica (the owner) for around two years. I was so happy for her when I found out she was opening her own salon. The decor is timeless and classic. The atmosphere is laid back but still professional. Jess is very knowledgeable about her products and walks me through everything she is doing with my hair/brows (which admittedly I am hard to please with my hair). The salon is very easy to get to and there is plenty of parking. I will always recommend her and her staff to anyone. At Lab salon you will ALWAYS be in good hands!,positive
I received such a great cut and the products Jess used were amazingg!! Definitely planning to go back for microblading when I get the chance! (I attended the grand opening and met a client that recently had it done - it looked phenomenal...definitely worth checking out),positive
Jess is the best! I've been trusting my hair to her for a year before she opened this beautiful salon. Always ecstatic with her work and company while being beautified.,positive
"I will never go anywhere else but LAB Salon... going from naturally brown to blonde hair is not an easy transition but not only did Jessica listen as I voiced all of my concerns (i.e. damage of bleaching my hair, worrying about if my eyebrows match, etc) she created the perfect blonde shade that, those who didn't know me previously, thought was my natural color!!! Since, I can't imagine trusting anyone else with my hair. The salon is Pinterest worthy and Jessica is the best.",positive
"Been looking for a salon that actually gives me what I am looking for, had a consult with Jessica for color and extensions. I felt super comfortable and she clearly knew what she was doing and understand exactly what I wanted. LOVE my color and extensions!!! Finally found my new salon!!! I am officially obsessed!! Jessica is awesome!! Highly recommend her!!",positive
"Safe to say I am obsessed with Jessica and LAB!! The place is impeccable, clean, trendy and everything I want in a salon! I feel fabulous whether Jessica is doing a quick blowout or cut and color. All my girlfriends go to Jessie and are equally obsessed! Cutest salon in the burgh!!",positive
Im so happy With my cut an color!!!so Natural-Jessica did an amazing job!she listened an took her time with me!she is very talented and up to date on New styles/ color and balayage! Also the products used are great! My Hair feels so Healthy! Im rebooked and looking forward to my next process of my hair color transformation. Thankyou Lab Salon,positive
"So the place isn't much to look at but that didn't worry me. The staff was really nice, but unfortunately I didn't have the best experience. The cut was fine but nothing special. Where my rating really goes down is that I ended up styling my hair by myself. They made it stick-straight so I asked for some curl but he said it wasn't possible but offered to let me try. I curled it easily with the straightening iron like I normally do. I would've normally just gone home and did it myself but I'm traveling and don't have my iron. Also he charged me $10 extra because my hair was long, which I wouldn't consider it to be. Overall, nice people, but not the best experience.",negative
"As other reviews have stated, the owner/stylist is extremely rude. The same as what another reviewer stated, I bought a Groupon, booked an appointment, and was refused service unless I paid an additional price for ""long hair"". I don't have an issue with that, except for the fact that my hair is not considered long by any means that would merit charging extra for a cut. When I questioned him, he was extremely rude in his response and could not tell me at what length hair started to be considered ""long"". This makes me think that he is trying to charge this additional fee for anyone having medium length hair, thus eliminating the savings offered by the Groupon. Definitely would not recommend, salon was also extremely sketchy and dirty looking - probably a blessing I didn't end up getting a cut there!",negative
"Wonderful atmosphere. I got a cut and color, it was fabulous, staff was very warm and welcoming. I will definitely be coming back. Please check out this salon downtown!",positive
"This was the worst salon experience of my life. I went in for a haircut, blow out and style. There was a huge wait even though I had made an appointment ahead of time. Despite this, when I finally got to the stylist chair, he chided me for being late. When I informed him that I had shown up on time, he nonchalantly said ""oh that must've been the other girl who was late"" with little apology for his rudeness. I waited for an hour and a half before the stylist even got to my hair cut. After being rude and blaming me for being late, he proceeded to do a slight trim and point blank refused the style I asked of him. The entire staff was rude and insulting from start to finish. The owner kept telling me how accomplished he was for having a salon in downtown Calgary, but everything about him screamed sub-professional. From his mannerism, to his hair technique to the upkeep of the salon. There was a garbage bin right beside where I was getting my hair washed. I sorely regret giving them my business and will be vocally recommending others away from this business.",negative
"I tried La Bella Salon from a groupon and was very happy. The service was awesome, they made sure I had a nice long scalp massage and I left with the best cut I have had in a long time. I am trying to grow my hair out and Jas knew just what to do. Most other places said they would chop off half and inch and I came out with a few inches gone - Jas cut off the ends making it look healthy again. Very happy!",positive
"I had the worst haircut of my life at this salon. The cut was blunt cut and uneven when i asked for layers, my fringe was chopped off to the middle of my forehead when i asked for but below the eyebrows, etc. The owner/stylist kept saying it was what i had asked for, and thankfully another customer sympathized with me and admitted the cut was not what I'd described. I was so disappointed that I rushed to another salon to get it fixed. The new stylist was shocked that a ""professional"" had done the cut because it was so bad. Please avoid this place - don't support such a shady business!",negative
"Wow. I went here due to a recommendation from a friend, and I was blown away. I was personally seen to by the owner himself, and he was fabulous. I was made to feel like a princess. (Gentlemen, if you're not looking for princess treatment, you will still get amazing service.) It is relevant for me to state that I have some looong hair. My numerous past foil experiences led me to believe that 5+ hours was the normal allotted time period for having my glorious mane washed, coloured, and trimmed to perfection. Well, lemme tell you: That man had me outta there within 3 hours. I would like to add that at no point did I feel like he was rushing; he was simply quick and efficient. ""Well, Stranger on the interwebs,"" you might be saying, ""If he got you out so quickly, your hair must have looked atrocious!"" So not the case! My hair looked, felt, and smelled beautiful. It's obvious that this is what he loves to do, and he has the skill to back it up. It was the best hair experience that I recall ever having. The head massage alone is enough to make me return to this mystical place of perfect coiffure. The rest -- the timely colour, the professional cut, the welcoming attitude -- was icing on the cake. ""Oh, talkative Narrator,"" you may ask, ""A salon such as this must be very busy."" True. So very true. This hair savant serviced many a person while I was there, but at no point did I feel neglected. It's a delicate dance of delegation to his workers and time management, and he pulled it off flawlessly. ""Miss Chatterbox,"" you could be thinking, ""That's all very nice, but what does it cost?"" A superb cut and colour can be pricey, but this was well below what I've paid at some salons. I believe a list of prices is available on the website. I ended up calling for my estimate. Thanks for reading my novelette. I obviously have no lack of good things to say about this place. All I will say further is that you will be giving yourself a real treat if you see Sam at La Bella Salon.",positive
"Love this little place. Not sure why the bad reviews. Cheap hair cuts. I get a simple hair cut and usually when I come in, there isn't a long wait. I used to live at the corner of Vegas Valley and S Nellis so it was a great place to walk straight down to get my hair cut. I've since moved outta state and will miss this place.",positive
"Be careful when you let these ladies cut your kids hair!! My sister took in my nephew for a haircut and the lady cut his scalp! If I could give no stars, I would!",negative
"I went in for some highlights, which would be the first time ever that i dye my hair... I explained to the hair stylist how i wanted my hair and she seamed to understand, or so I thought... She started working on my hair, and then left me waiting while she worked on other people, my head started to burn and I told her about it, and she looked at me with a oops i forgot about you face and she rushed me to the sink to wash my hair, and as shes unfolding each foil paper on my head she has this look on her face like she did something wrong, which started to worry me... When she walks me back to the chair and i see my hair I flipped! she bleached my hair too long and made my highlights white!! Well at least the bottom layers of my hair are white while the top layer is yellow! I was so freaked out I nearly cried! And all she did was tell me it would look nice once she dried it and curled it. I was so upset i didnt want her to do anything else to my hair but my husband convinced me to give it a try, so i let her dry my hair and curl it but it didn't fix anything! And besides the whole color fuck up, she made the highlight like 2 inches away from my roots... Idk if that how its supposed to be or not but Im not happy at all! Now im scared to dye my hair again lol bottom line is dont get your highlights done here!",negative
I was looking for a place that can do 2 things... color my hair & haircut. They took about 15 minutes until they started working on me. I did my hair a 2 tone brown. It looks lovely. I also cut my hair. My total was 95. Not too bad.,positive
This place is cute and adorable for the whole family! At first it is somewhat hidden but you won't miss the red $5 haircut sign. I've met the owner and she is super friendly and professional the staff is bilingual! I like to get my waxing done here It's only $8 ! It does lack more parking. Overall this place is great,positive
"Great place! Quick, easy and flexible! Got there a little early and they fit me right in. Had waxing done and she was great! Only in town for the weekend and one of the most painless waxings I have had. Highly recommended!",positive
I can't say enough good things about Tinashe. I go to her for waxing and she is incredible - makes you very comfortable.,positive
Absolutely the worst hair cut and experience I've ever had. My hair ended up looking so choppy and uneven I was shocked. When I told her to fix it she started scolding me for not having even hair. Just mind blown on how horrible the customer service but even worse how bad my hair cut was. Did I mention while I was asking her to fix it her coworker stepped in and told her to just do a full cut wash and style and to charge me another $85 on top because she should not charge me just $30 for 10 mins of work. I'm so sad at what they did to my hair at this salon and I hope no one ever has to experience this. Photos attached!,negative
"Tinisha does a great job waxing. It's been awhile since I've waxed as I remember it hurt a lot, but today's experience was painless.",positive
Tinisha is amazing. She is so good at what she does and is so caring and sweet. I've always had a great experience here.,positive
"Had an amazing experience with Sascha and Tanisha yesterday who did an updo and makeup application for me. They are lovely, friendly and extremely skilled. Great work! Would highly recommend!",positive
I tried La Jolie Femme for the first time today and I am impressed! My manicure is awesome! Tinisha is excellent - she has a lovely & friendly manner about her that makes you feel at ease. The location is in a very convenient nook near University & Wellington. I'll be back :),positive
I had an event at a hotel down the street and booked style and makeup the girls listened to what I asked for and the results were excellent the price was exactly as advertised the salon was clean and the staff was friendly,positive
Tinisha was so great! Been a while since my last wax and she made me feel so comfortable throughout the appointment. Super professional and friendly! Will absolutely be returning to check out the other services they offer.,positive
"This place is amazing, the woman who did my treatment was honestly amazing. I'm going to go here for everything. The time and attention and great conversation made the experience lovely.",positive
"I went here with a Groupon for a Brazilian wax. I believe the owner was the woman who did the waxing for me. Let me tell you how bad this was! I was in so much pain and she was so inconsiderate telling me to be more flexible .. i was bleeding so bad when I looked down at one point and saw the amount of blood on my thighs, I was shocked.. When i got home I was still bleeding after 2 hours and had to wear a pad .. it was like a mini-period.. I am still in a lot of pain today and noticed that a lot of the hairs are broken and have not been waxed properly.. I was put through so much pain to have this kind of sloppy work done? Are you serious? I will not be returning to this place. Edit: thanks to this place I now have a really painful skin boil in my private area to deal with.. thank you la jolie femme",negative
"Great experience! Bought a Brazillian wax from groupon. The place is clean, elegant but a little small. The 2 girls working there are very friendly. The girl who did my Brazillian made me feel very comfortable and kept conversation to keep my mind off the awkwardness/pain. Will defenitly be returning!",positive
"I'm not changing my rating given the quality of pedi, mani and threading that Tinisha provides. She's gentle, got steady hands and is good at what she does. My bigger issue is with the owner, who is a little loud and stingy. She's really weird about the girls here using too many towels and often doesn't honour the discount program they have for regular customers. The girls working here are a lot nicer to deal with. It's not the cheaper places around, but they know what they're doing.",positive
"I recently decided to start getting Brazilian waxes again, and after reading a couple of positive reviews about La Jolie Femme here on Yelp, I decided to buy a Groupon for three brazilians. My first appointment was with Tynesha, who was very sweet and friendly, making me feel relaxed and comfortable, and that definitely helped when the Brazilian started because it HURT. Tynesha was very reassuring, but after I went home, I had a rash for four days and realized that at least half the hair was broken off, not waxed out. However, I wanted to give them a second chance, so I went back this past week to see Elizabeth. She was terrific, very friendly and accommodating, and thorough. My appointment was almost painless (although I had taken two extra-strength Advil beforehand as well!) Both girls were lovely people and great to chat with, which was a welcome distraction. I am going back.",positive
"I bought a deal from Buytopia for their Manicure and Pedicure. First, when I got there, they were running out of hot water for pedicure. I had to wait for 15 minutes. In addition to the long wait, they don't seem to sanitize their tools. Second, they did not soak my fingers in the nail cleanser before applying the nail polish. Third, they don't have proper fans/lighting to dry hands or feet. Through out the process, the girls kept gossiping to each other about their other colleagues or clients very loudly. (Come on, this is a spa! I am not paying to listen to your complaints about your life!) Lastly, despite all the bad things happened, they imposed a mandatory tip and HST of $17, on top of $19 I already paid to Buytopia. I ended up paying $36 for an awful experience.",negative
Love this place! You can call in and make a reservation for a specific stylist or just show up and check in fo first available. I always do first available and have always received a great haircut.,positive
"For the money, I'd go here over those other chain places like Great Clips or Supercuts any day of the week. I believe Ashley has cut my hair twice, super nice and she did a great job (one of the best and cleanest fades I've ever gotten). Staff is friendly, the shop is clean and it's priced competitively. Will be back.",positive
"Like many others, it seems the onslaught of radio ads actually worked because I eventually went. Don't let the ads fools you...this is just a standard barber shop geared more toward the ""man's man"". I have now gone 3 times and get a near perfect cut every time. I've had the same stylist, Krista, cut my hair. She's very nice and obviously has a lot of experience cutting hair. My main criteria for sticking with a barber shop is consistency. Krista has cut my hair exactly the same way every time. That's enough to keep me going back in spite of the ""wicked awesome"" commercials.",positive
"Julia was absolutely awesome! I haven't had a professional hair cut in 15 years. I've been just buzzing it the same length all around and I now understand why I'm not a stylist. She did an amazing job! I knew about what I wanted, but I told her I trusted her to help pick the lengths and it turned out perfect. She was very nice and very professional. I will definitely be going there from now on. Ask for Julia if you want an excellent hair cut.",positive
Have not had a bad haircut yet. Been going to this place for a few years and always am a happy camper afterwords. Girls are mostly great looking and some are better conversationalists than others. I like it!,positive
"This place is a parody of itself. It's almost as if the whole idea behind Lady Jane's was based on a wild dream of a pubescent 16-year-old boy. Needless to say, I had to see what the hype was about.... Perhaps you've heard the outrageously cheesy radio commercials advertising ""wicked awesome"" haircuts for $10? Well, being that the latest location was situated right down the street from me and with the bad economy and all, I thought I'd see what was so ""wickedly awesome"" about it. As you walk-in, you come to a computer monitor where you browse screen shots of the stylists to chose from. That's right, you pick based on looks as to who earns the right to work on your dome. The busty blonde was my pick. (The naughty looking red with stiletto's was my second choice). In the wait area, there's black leather recliners and plasma TV's to keep you entertained. If that doesn't do it for you, feel free to challenge one of the hambone patrons to a game of foosball. If you're more of the well read type, browse back-issues of Sports Illustrated. The atmosphere was hardly conducive to reading with all the distractions though, including Nickelback and other generic rock blaring from the overhead speakers. When your scantily dressed stylist is ready for you, she calls you back to her station. Each station has it's very own plasma TV. I wasn't looking to be hypnotized by the boob-tube though, only the boobs.",negative
He made me look beautiful! Got a lot of compliments on my new hair cut. Hoping he can make me look this beautiful always!,positive
"The reviews are VERY accurate. Nadar is very talented. He was very quick (wash, cut and style in 45 mins). I gave him a rough guideline on what I wanted, he asked a couple of questions and I got the look I was looking for perfectly. I will be back.",positive
"This guy NAder is amazinggggggg!!!!!! He washed cut and styled my hair in 20mins!!!!! And it's the most amazing cut I've ever had in my life and I'm not just saying this to give him a great review, I really mean it my blow out was amazing!!!! Everything was amazing!",positive
"Amazing hair cut! Seriously! best hair cut i have ever had! Nader cut my 3a thick curly hair perfectly! first try! after YEARS of trying to get my hairdresser to cut my hair a certain way and in long layers! Nader has the gift of figuring out what you want and delivers! He cut my hair quickly, but with precision and confidence. He also takes the time to listen to your concerns and makes honest recommendations. No hesitation in recommending Nader, he is truly a gifted hairstylist. I look forward to many more visits. So glad i found this salon and right in my neighborhood!",positive
"I arrived and walked out within 40 minutes, and I was early for my appointment. Nader cut my hair so quickly with so much confidence. And then did my blow out while working simultaneously on another girls treatment. Just masterful. I will definitely be back.",positive
"My first Haircut by Nader, so VERY happy with my hair !!! many times I have to go home and restyle when other stylists do my hair ( have always gone to high end Toronto salons) not this time I felt great !!! Very professional a talented stylist !!! will definitely be back and tell my friends finally no need to drive or train to TO. What was really great was I got exactly what I Asked for and Nader advised different ways to style and wear my hair, Excellent !!!!!!",positive
"I recently moved to Pickering and dreaded having to find another hair dresser. My thick black hair is not easy to cut properly, especially how I like it. So after finding this place I decided to cautiously try it out. The result? Right on the mark with the first try. I was very impressed with how quickly Nadar, the hair dresser and owner, delivered exactly what I asked for. No more trepidation. I'll be coming back again.",positive
"It was my first time going to Laia Hair Styling. Nader did a great job on my hair he did really quick, and I show my picture how I want it. If you want to try this Laia hair Styling you need to set an appointment to see Nader he's the only one working there.",positive
"I decided to make an appt with Nader after finding him on YELP. I was in Pickering visiting my family over the holidays and needed a good blow out which is hard to come by. I took a chance and it was the BEST blowout I think I've ever had. Nader was very flexible with timing, he listened to what I wanted, and did exactly that. I showed him a few pics too and right away he knew the look I was going for (Maria Menounos hair!). He was done in 30mins and the blow out lasted a very long time. He is also very reasonable price wise. Thanks for a great blow-out Nader, maybe you'll decide to move to Vancouver so that I can have good hair days more often :-)",positive
"Nader is the Master of hair stylists. Cut, color and styled quickly and better than anyone. His blow drying styles last soooo long. He also highlights and cuts my 25 year old daughter's hair who lives in Toronto but travels to Pickering to have Nader work his magic. Many of our friends have become his clients as well. His expertise and great pricing keeps us all coming back",positive
Daniel has been brining color to my life with his hair magic and wonderful soul since I moved to Cleveland last summer! Not only does he slay my hair on the regular but he always has my 10 year old daughter styled to be the coolest kid in school too! Daniel and the Le Beau ladies are our favorite Friday mother daughter treat!,positive
"Finding a new hair salon can be such a hassle so I'm here to tell you Jackie is a hair goddess. Seriously. I've come here I think 3 or 4 times over the past two years (not because I go elsewhere- just because my life is hectic and I'm lazy) and I always love my look better than I ever have before - as in ever in my entire life. It's crazy how much hair can change your entire aesthetic. I usually don't come into hair appointments with much of a direction because I have absolutely no knowledge of what ""works"" for me and I think that's exactly what Jackie excels at creating. Additionally, I've always been told that I shouldn't go blonde because it would look bad with my dark eyes and an olive-y (not my words- I think I'm pale lol) skin tone. Well since no one likes being told what to do I decided I was going to try it and Jackie NAILED IT with the color - it looked so wonderful on me and I personally like it better than brunette me. She gives you a realistic expectation of what she thinks she can achieve while still keeping your hair healthy and won't tell you that she can do anything she doesn't think is viable. Neither of us thought we would get my hair as light as we did so it was a pleasant surprise :) Aside from talent, this saloon is super welcoming and the staff seems to genuinely get along great. They have all your boujee hair care needs with Kevin Murphy products (if you have super dry hair you neglect for months on end like I do they're a necessity). Last but not least, they're pretty much in a girl gang with the other lady-owned Tremont businesses so whats not to love?",positive
"I booked an appointment here on a whim because I really, really needed a cut/color, I couldn't get in with my regular stylist at a different salon, and Le Beau was able to give me a same day appointment because of a last minute cancellation. Wow, did I get lucky. I had an appointment with the amazing, talented, creative Daniel Price who worked some serious magic to lift the red color out of my hair and give me a beautiful caramel tone after just two color application appointments. On top of the beautiful hair cut/color, Daniel introduced me to Kevin Murphy products. He explained that they are like ""skin care products, but for your hair."" So, basically they are really ""hair care"" products. Now, I'll admit, I'm a total beauty product junkie. I'm always trying new products and jumping from one brand to another, but using Kevin Murphy products has stopped me in my tracks. These products bring hair care to a whole new level. I've been using the wash, rinse, hair spray and resort product for over two months now and the one time I had to use a different brand (still high-end) I saw a noticeable difference in the way my hair looked and felt. So now I'm hooked. I know this is a long review, but I just also have to mention that everyone at this salon is so friendly. They greet you by name as you walk in the door, and don't have that ""too cool for school"" vibe that I've seen at a lot of other salons. Thank you Le Beau for giving me a great experience every time I'm there. You guys rock!",positive
"A friend of mine recommended to go to Le Beau and see Jackie - his recommendation was spot on. I keep a fairly conservative hairstyle, and I've found that several places interpret this in an edgy way. Jackie listened to my request, did a fantastic job, and I left with probably one of the best haircuts I've ever had. In terms of the amenities, the salon is really nice and has a unique style (ex. the drawers are made of craftsman tool boxes) and the chairs are comfortable. Jackie and staff are very nice and knowledgeable about the neighborhood, which is beneficial as I'm relatively new to Tremont. Note - they do offer facial waxing treatments to compliment the haircuts. Definitely will be back.",positive
"My name is Kristen and I'm a 30 something mom who likes awesome hair! Lol. So let me tell you that for the last ten years I've lived all over- I've moved probably 6 times (due to school + work + jobs) on the east coast and the Midwest, and I'm always on the hunt for where I can stay looking sharp! This is NOT easy let me tell you! Le Beau is the 5th salon I've tried since moving to Cleveland almost 4 years ago and it's hands down THE BEST. Not only in the Cleveland area but it's my favorite salon EVER! I wear a short pixie cut and I like it classy and fun (which I don't think is easy to do) and Jackie nails it every time! Jackie is really great at communicating which I think is key. She is also very perceptive, flexible, and detail oriented. Jackie, Lauren, and all the girls will make you feel right at home. If you are looking for exceptional service and a look that is spot on you have found the right place with Le Beau!",positive
"I have been coming to Le Beau for well over a year now and why has it taken me so long to tell everyone how great it is?!! I don't even know! I was an avid grocery store box dye kind of girl and I just was looking for a change. To have someone like Jackie explain things and suggest styles to me have changed my life! I honestly leave feeling so good/pretty. Jackie (the owner) and all her staff, they are so nice and professional. I urge anyone that are on the fence about giving up the grocery store life style DO IT!!!! You will never go back",positive
Found out about Le Beau through Yelp and was not disappointed!! I had a cut and color with Jackie and i LOVE it! I cut off probably about 10 inches and did a balayge. I showed her a picture briefly just as an an idea but she had it down. She knew exactly what I wanted. Prices are reasonable. I would highly recommend her and Le Beau!,positive
"I am new to town and have been looking for a new salon. I wanted to try out this place and when I called they recommended Jackie. I explained what I was looking for color wise and we agreed to cut off 2 inches because I was trying to grow my hair out but wanted to cut off the bad ends. The color turned out pretty nicely, however... She cut off 4-5""... Way more than I agreed to. I tried to be happy leaving the salon but I woke up the next morning really upset and have not been happy about the cut since. I wanted to get a warning to anyone who's trying out this salon for the first time to ask for a minimal amount to get cut off, otherwise you may leave with your hair a lot shorter than you asked for.",negative
"Nicolette transformed my botched hair job into something so cute, you would never know how it used to look. I loved the atmosphere of this salon and every single person working here was so friendly and welcoming I referred my boyfriend to the same stylist and he looks fantastic, I would recommend to any and everyone. Thankful to have found my new stylist!",positive
DO NOT GO HERE. The hair stylists do not listen to what you want. While they are brilliant with color (hence the two stars) they are horrible with hair cuts. I've been here twice and the first time the hair stylist cut my hair in a weird way. But since the color was so great I overlooked it. The second time I went another lady cut my hair WAY shorter than I wanted it. I showed her pictures of what I wanted and she did not pay attention to them. They do not listen to what you want and just do what they want. My hair is ruined because they did not pay attention to what I wanted. I will never go here again. Also very over priced for what you get.,negative
"I've been going to Le Beau (formerly Studio Le Beau on W. 11th in Tremont) and getting my hair cut by the owner, Jackie, for more than 5 years. She is phenomenal! I've never had a bad hair cut! Jackie is super cool and super personable. The new space, Le Beau, is hip and stylish. I love their line of products by Kevin Murphy out of Australia. Definitely keeps my super curly hair tamed and frizz-free. I cannot say enough good things about this place. Go and check it out!",positive
"Booked this appointment yesterday because I knew I would have time to get my haircut after traveling in from Texas, and I'm so glad I made it here. Kate was awesome, she really listened to what I wanted and did an awesome job with my cut and style. The product they use is also great. If I move to Cleveland then I will definitely be back!",positive
"Reasonably priced and generally speaking, all the ladies are super nice and have top-notch style and fashion sense. I feel like I can trust their hair design / stylizing suggestions and tips. I really like their Kevin Murphy line of hair products as well. The environment is contemporary with a brick, wood, and iron trendy Greek.",positive
"I loved this place so much, I was my first time coming here and they really do an amazing job !! I definitely advice you to visit Le Manoir, trust me you won't regret it ;)) .....",positive
"So first, i was greeted with a closed shop when it said on the internet that it was open until 8. There was a sales person, and what looked like to be the owner or manager. they basicly shooded me off the front of the shop... i tried to ask a question so that i dont return the next day for nothing again and this cruella devil Wannabe petting a chihuahua came to the door looking at me as if i was begging her for something and wanted me to yell my question throw the door... so i decided that i wasnt going to beg someone to take my money and take my business elsewhere. This place is barely a beauty parlor anymore... more like a cheap retail store with cheap stuff from etsy and the employees think they are way cooler then cool. As for the actual service... well you know when someone got there nails done there because everyone has the same unoriginal designs. Not worth the money",negative
"Le meilleur salon à Montréal, des ongles beaux et en santé, employés super sympathique, on se sent tout simplement bien quand on passe au manoir!",positive
"(Français et anglais) J'ai longtemps fait affaire avec le Manoir pour mes ongles et c'est très différent des expériences dans des salons asiatiques. Les filles font attention à nos ongles comme si c'était les leurs. Pas de limage intense, pas d'acétone et un bon signe pour voir qu'elles utilisent de bons produits de qualité : elles ne portent pas de masque lorsqu'elles sont à l'oeuvre. Elles vendent de coquets vêtements, maillots de bain et divers petites ''mignonneries''. Puisque c'est un service et des produits haut de gamme, les prix sont plutôt élevés mais je n'ai jamais été déçue d'une manicure reçue par le Manoir. J'ai été au salon pour un an environ et maintenant mes ongles sont plus en santé que jamais! Ils étaient cassants et minces, maintenant ils sont durs comme de la roche et longs comme des faux ongles donc je peux juste me mettre du vernis à la maison. Si vous avez les sous, je recommende Le Manoir. Émilie est une excellente propriétaire et écoute toujours nos histoires, une vraie place de fifille! I used to go to Le Manoir for a year because i had thin nails that kept breaking. They use really good quality products and the girls are really nice to talk to. I liked going there for my nails since they got unique stuffs (as clothes, jewelry, skin products) and as a girly woman, i like to do a little bit of shopping after getting my nails perfectly well done. Strongly recommend Emilie and her team if you want your nails to grow healthy and strong. Sadly don't go there anymore because my nails are thick enough naturally now (FIRST TIME OF MY LIFE!) and really long so i can just apply nail polish at home, but makes me really miss the girls they are so nice and friendly.",positive
"Been getting my nails done here for months and I LOVE this place! Not only is the service wonderful, but the ladies are all so talented and passionate about what they do! I also recently got my first haircut here and loved it as well. I definitely recommend this to everyone! They also sell lovely clothes & jewelry. Great find & so happy I am a regular! ;)",positive
"I was very excited to hear about this new spa and upon viewing their Instagram was impressed by their nail art. I called to book a massage but was told by the lady on the phone that it was a better deal to purchase a Tuango voucher for a massage/facial and although I couldn't find many reviews online I bought the voucher without thinking too much about it. BIG MISTAKE. I have rarely had to deal with such incompetence. I had to call several times over several days before I could finally speak to someone. Then I was told they only had space two weeks from then. I figured it didn't much matter and looked forward to the date I could get the facial. I tried calling back closer to the facial to try to also get a manicure but I was told that was not possible. Unfortunately, on the day of the facial I woke up with a terrible stomach flu and spent the whole morning and afternoon throwing up. I was aware of the 48 hour cancellation policy but as these were extenuating circumstances I called to cancel. I was told it was too late, if I couldn't make it I would lose the value of the voucher. When I explained that I understood the policy but that I was much too sick to go, I was told it wouldn't ""be fair to their other clients if they allowed me to cancel last minute"". Seriously? Is it more fair to their other clients if I show up and contaminate all of them? Is it fair to have the aesthetician be forced to deal with someone throwing up on their table? Is it fair for me to lose $70 because I cannot physically make it to the spa in this condition? I think not. Where is the common sense in this?! So I'm stuck at home sick as dog and flushing $70 down the drain because the staff at Le Manoir-Coquetterie are a bunch of unsympathetic jerks and crooks. I might as well have been robbed by them, it would be the same outcome. There are TONS of spas and salons in Montreal. Save your money and go somewhere else where you might actually be treated with respect. UPDATE: After 3 weeks, they finally replied to my complaint on Social Media and denied the fact that they refused to reschedule the appointment. They insisted that they had offered to reschedule for the same price of the coupon even though that was precisely the opposite of what happened. Further proving my point that Le Manoir - Coquetterie is NOT TO BE TRUSTED.",negative
"I will never go back here. It was a complete waste of time and money. I had also gotten the FabFind deal for a wash, cut and style. Unlike other reviewers, I got through on the first call and was able to book an appointment for a convenient time. I got there 15 mins early and they weren't busy so they got me started right away. The staff did not seem particularly friendly or enthusiastic about their jobs. I've always found salons I've frequented to be full of energy, but at Lid it felt like no one wanted to be there. No one offered me any beverages or anything. It was just a really blah atmosphere and I wanted to get out of there asap. I went over what I wanted with the stylist (just a trim and some layers). I always love getting head massages during the wash but didn't get one here. The stylist then proceeded to roughly brush out my tangles, trim my ends, and as I reminded him I was in desperate need of some layers put in, he took a call on his cell phone! I was shocked silent. I've never seen such unprofessional behavior before! He didn't even apologize or explain why he needed to take a call in the middle of cutting my hair. Anyways, I have curly hair and it was a humid day so I wanted to keep my hair curly rather than get a blow out. However, he was blow drying my hair straight before I could even say anything. I also didn't get the layers I wanted. In the end, the whole thing took less than 30 min and my hair looked exactly like it normally does when I straighten it. I stupidly tipped the guy what I normally tip a stylist and regretted it immediately. It was totally undeserved. Oh well I got to use up the deal at least. It's too bad that I now have to go get my hair cut again next week! This time I'm going to Industry a few blocks away that comes highly recommended from a friend. Unfortunately, I'll have to pay double but I think it'll be worth it.",negative
"This is no doubt my favourite pampering place to go to ! I had had my hair done here in the past 3 years and every time it is unique and styled to the max ! I have people stop me on the street and ask me where do I get my hair done. I went from black to blonde and back again - all maintaining a healthy beautiful hair & cut ! Vanessa the owner, is a true artist and the staff is professional and fun.",positive
"I have been with LID since the beginning and even before - half of my 35 years I have seen Vanessa! I receive compliments on my hair colour and cut on a weekly basis and have never been anything but 100% satisfied with my hair, their service and their advice. Wishing them every single success and the accolades they certainly deserve.",positive
"I saw a woman crossing the street with most phenomenal hair cut and colour about 2 years ago, so I asked her what salon she goes to and she said ""Lid...It's the best."" I was looking to find a new stylist after being unsatisfied and with the salon I was going to, so I made an appointment. The location is incredibly easy to get to, being in the heart of Yorkville, and the best part of it is that it comes without ego or pretension. The space is warm and the people are easygoing and very inviting, not Snobville at all...I met with Mel, who I was immediately comfortable with, she was like a friend, who just happens to have a top shelf brain and vision for really great hair. She understands the actual chemistry and science behind color and the true art and lines of a cut. I am always impressed by her knowledge and eye. I appreciate the feeling you get from a person who is obviously educated and very good at what they do, as that can be hard to find. When I started seeing her, my hair was just above my shoulders, curly and full. I wanted to grow it out. My colour was dark brown, and I needed my roots done. The colour adjustment she did was perfect, she took the edge off the brown/black harshness that happens when you need touch ups on dark hair, and the cut was exact. As my hair grew out, Mel shaped it and cut it, so that it always looked longer as it was growing, and I guess the proper word for it would be, balanced. I never felt like it was getting top heavy or winging out. She explained to me how my hair had been cut in the past and how she is going to cut it this time to create the look I'm going for. I am one of those people who when I leave a salon, I need to feel that I am leaving with exactly what I wanted or else I can't get my mind off it, and every time I leave Lid I feel it is done right, the first time, no second guessing, no settling. I am very particular about that. For the last several years, my hair has been dark brown, and whenever I have tried to lighten it in the past in anyway, it has always looked brassy or unhealthy, but I always wanted it a bit lighter. So now, my hair has grown out to long past my shoulders, and I have lightened it a few shades, dabbled in the ombre look and have perfectly toned highlights throughout, and I love it. The colour is perfection, my skin tone is balanced, and my cut is exactly how I envisioned it to be as it grew out. I have had strangers compliment my hair and ask me what salon I go to, just like it started for me. I have witnessed all the stylists there, and am continuously impressed with their work. Salons and stylists are personal, and when you find the right one it clicks. Lid is my recommendation every time.",positive
"I was referred to Lid Salon from a friend of mine who had been going to one of their stylists for about a year prior and had always been extremely happy with their services. I booked an appointment with the same stylist and didn't have a problem getting an appointment. I did have to wait a week but they were great at accommodating a time that worked in my schedule and were very friendly on the phone( I had been told they were usually booked solid). anyways, I instantly liked the vibe there. Its not overly luxurious but it made up for that in charm and warmth. I was offered a drink within being there for two minutes and another stylist chatted with me while I waited for my appointment. I was getting my hair coloured and cut and am super specific about what i want, so i usually place a lot of trust in a stylist to actually figure it out because i just start referencing a bunch of famous people and hope that they can come up with some sort of hybrid hair do. Luckily, my stylist wanted to talk, was super current and seemed to have it figured out pretty quickly. Got my hair washed and got a massage by an assistant I think....she was super nice as well. I left not only liking the colour but changed my bangs a little, at her suggestion....which normally I would have been so nervous about, but she made me feel confident that they would look great...and they did. When i was done everyone there seemed interested in the result,which i have never experienced before. Other stylists mentioning how great it looked and so on. It made me feel more confident to leave then getting a lipstick touch-up like some other salons do on the way out. I had a great first experience at Lid and will definitely be returning.",positive
"Reading Julia's review, it is very similar to my experience. I went to Lid with a FabFind deal for highlights, wash, blowdry and cut. I had left 3 messages when calling during their opening hours, before someone finally called me back to book the appointment. Had I not already paid, I'd have heard the message bank once and called the next salon down the road instead. When I arrived for my appointment, the hairdresser briefly went through what I'd like done today. I was given a choice of 3 colours for highlights, other salons would give me a book of samples to flick through. None of the options were 100% what I was looking for, but I didn't ask to see other colours. At other salons I've always placed some trust in the colours advised by the hairdresser and was always happy with the result even if it wasn't what I had in mind. I guess the colours offered here were either a poor advisement, or a misinterpretation of what I said I wanted, because I wasn't happy with the colour I picked. I was offered tea or coffee while my hair was being coloured. The end result was the highlights having roots of 5-7mm on the day they were done, looking like they were done over a month ago. Overall I'm pretty disappointed with the quality of customer service, communication, and the final product. This is the first time I've left a salon thinking that my hair looked better beforehand. I wouldn't return, even for a discounted deal.",negative
"After letting it grow for months and months with nary a cut, my hair had become something of an wild, untamed mess. No longer wishing to risk being mistaken for Medusa, I decided that something had to be done. Always on the lookout for great salons and ways to pinch pennies, I ended up snagging a Fabfind deal for a wash, blowdry and cut for $35 at Lid back in May. I probably called 2 or 3 times and left a message that wasn't returned before I was able to make an appointment, which was slightly annoying. Their website states that their hours are 8am to ""closing"", whenever that is, but it seemed like any time I tried to call after 5pm nobody picked up so it's probably best to call in the morning or early afternoon. Apparently Lid is a very busy salon, and with the success of their Fabfind deal I actually couldn't get a Saturday appointment for several weeks. When the day finally arrived for my 3pm appointment with Angela, I showed up about 10 minutes early and she was able to get started with me right away. The salon itself is located on the second floor of a little building in Yorkville, up a narrow flight of stairs. The decor is pretty simplistic with little to mention in terms of ambiance, and I think the building used to be a house because the salon is divided into all these different rooms. They also do esthetics here so there are nail stations and a reflexology bed and the like. My appointment started off with a brief chat about what I wanted to do with my hair (just a trim with some layers) and then Angela proceeded to wash my hair and give me an invigorating scalp massage. I believe this salon uses Kevin Murphy products for the most part, which I love. Angela wasn't much of a chatter, which was fine by me, although I do wish that she had elicited some more feedback from me such as how I would prefer to have my hair styled after the cut. Overall, I'm satisfied with my haircut and I have no major complaints. However, the regular price for a cut, blowdry and style here ranges from $75 - $110. At that price point, I would expect a lot more than what I received. From my experience, I definitely wouldn't return here if I were paying full price, and I probably wouldn't come back even with a Fabfind offer. I've paid much less than $110 at salons that return your messages, give you reminder phone calls, offer you complimentary beverages and hand massages, and leave you feeling ""fabulous"" and not just ""fine"".",negative
"It is interesting how the reviews of this salon are either really bad (one star) or excellent (almost 5 stars). These ratings reflect the uneven quality and professional experience provided by the hairdressers. Basically you go there and you get that lucky ticket, or you don't. I had a horrible experience with one of the hairdressers. The guy coloured my your hair but I am not sure how much of a colour specialist he is. I am not sure he knew what he was doing. I left the place in shock. The manager was friendly and apologetic for the crappy service I received. I can only speak to My personal experience. To make matters more stressful the music was so loud I don't know how they can work all day listening to the endless bombing of the nauseating music. I would not return to this place.",negative
"Just received the worst hair cut of my life! I would have had better luck diving head-first into a lawn mower. I saw it coming a mile away. For starters, the woman responsible for this hatchet job looked absolutely MISERABLE cutting hair. Stoned? Hungover? Maybe...I gave her a photo booth picture I took of myself a while back for reference. Completely disregarded! Just started snip-snip-snipping away at my beautiful curls. Longer on the top and shorter on the sides turned into shorter all over in a matter of seconds. I look like I have an over grown brush cut with no hope in the world of styling. I was apprehensive about shutting down this operation because that's always embarrassing, so I suffered through it. Big mistake. Finally, when she carelessly lopped off my bangs far above the eyebrows, I lost it. I told her it looked like f*****g s***, to which she told me not to use profanity, stopped cutting, and made me leave. I didn't have to pay, but I still feel ripped off. I should have walked down to queen street and paid a crackhead 5 dollars to cut my hair with a pair of hedge clippers. Guaranteed better results. Every time I look in the mirror, I can't help but cringe at the sight of me. I look like 'simple jack' from the film 'tropic thunder'. Thank god hair grows back. 0 stars.",negative
"As someone who is SO picky with their hair and stylists, this is actually the only place in Toronto I'll go. Sophia is unreal with colour and seems to be the only stylist in the world that knows what a ""trim"" means instead of a cut. Plus this place is pretty cheap. I've sent so many friends to Sophia and everyone raves about her. 5++ stars",positive
"My stylist, Rose, reeked of cigarette smoke all through my cut. It was all I could do to keep from choking. I shall not return.",negative
"Terrible hairdressers with little to no experience! I came here hoping to get my hair trimmed and lighten. It was dark brown almost black and I wanted to get it to a medium brown. What I got was 4inches off my length and blonde, brassy, damaged streaks of blond on the inner front of my hair. Each side was a different color of blonde. She left the black completely dark and charged me full price. When I asked her why she didn't do the back she said it was more money and I would have to come back. The sign on the front says highlights 65 dollars not more. She did not listen to what I wanted at all. I paid an extra 30 dollars to blow-dry my hair and it was plain with no style. RIP Off! They offered to fix my hair for free and now I'm back to where I started dark brown almost black hair with some odd random reddish streaks. I overheard my hair dresser and the manager saying that she screwed it up again and the Manger just said don't worry I have your back. ??? Save your money! Do your own hair before coming here because you could probably do a better job yourself.",negative
"This was one of the worst hair experiences that I have ever had with dying and highlights. The service I had was terrible and the guy who did my hair rushed and did not even have the decency to take colour off my face and my ears. When I first walked in the door, they had a few people in seats getting their hair done but no one sitting down waiting. No one asked me what I would like for about half an hour. I also requested my hair to be styled and straightened, not cut. Once the guy finished dying my hair, he blowed dry ""straight"" my hair. I asked if he could use a flat iron to make it completely straight, not curved inwards, where he then insisted that flat irons were bad for the hair and he did not want to use it on my head. I understand this but as a paying customer, I like having my hair a certain way. He still did not flat iron my hair nor take the colour off my face. He said he had another customer and could not take the extra time and told me that the colour would come off in a few days. I paid the price (180$), and will never be a repeat customer, for this price i expected a much better service, and quality. My hair is pretty short (ear length) and I have been to places that do better service for cheaper prices. (I highly recommend trade secrets in Bloor west village)",negative
"I had my hair cut yesterday and was really happy with everyone there. I went in on a whim at around 2 ish - so I had no appointment, so they slipped me in for the soonest they had open which was 5:00 PM (on a Friday? That's pretty good). I had been weary about other salons because I once inquired with En Vogue and the guy there was absolutely rude and accused me of lying, when all I wanted was a clarification on something one of his employees had said. Way to treat any potential customers! Anyway, so I just wanted some cleaning up, trim the ends a bit and that's it. Maggie washed and blow dried my hair, she was absolutely amazing, I have never seen such a diligent worker. Also best blow dry of my life, she took her time, was really nice, and made my hair look great. Then Patricia took care of the cut, she gave me just a clean up and a slight trip as I didn't want a whole lot chopped off. She did a great job also, and gave me some clean up trims at the front. Overall very happy. I will definitely be going back and already recommended the spot to my cousin. Such pleasant staff!",positive
"I came for a colour correction and came out feeling like a new woman! Within minutes of leaving the store I have received several compliments! Jessica did an amazing job, from asking about my hair history, showing me different options, explaining next steps thoroughly, listening to my request of using cold water and asking if the temperature was to my liking. The place itself is very nice, good music, very comfortable washing stations. All the ladies are nice and hard working. I will definitely come back!",positive
"It's been about 2 weeks since I had my hair done, the fade has settled and I love my hair! I can't stop touching it and playing with it...it both looks and feels really good even after all that processing was done to it. Whatever Alicia did was magic! I made an appointment for a hair cut and a balayage through the online booking system. Most appointments appeared to be booked up about 2 weeks in advance of when I was looking but luckily Alicia had an opening. I was appreciative that the studio does some due diligence on new clients beforehand which was a few questions about hair history and current hair photos. They do this to make sure your hair isn't so over processed that any other work will destroy it, instead of turning you away at the studio. I had some correspondence with the studio to make sure I had booked the correct services for my hair. All of the communications were fast and helpful since I wasn't sure exactly what I needed. As for the actual experience, it couldn't have gone better. Alicia is listed as a new talent but rest assured she's only newer to the studio (as opposed to new at hair) and experienced. I had a goal in mind and showed her a picture of it and she let me know that it would probably take a couple of sessions to get my hair as light as I wanted. No problem, I'd rather take it slow than lose my hair to impatience. We started off with the haircut which I absolutely love. I was getting a lot of length off and there were no problems with the cut; no extra inches off or timidness about cutting it all off. Then came the colouring which was about a 6 hour ordeal. This is where Alicia's amazing personality really came in to play because she's really chill and easy to talk to which made the marathon go by a little faster. We had some help during the process with the salon assistants and Lisa also came by to check on how everything was going. It was really awesome to see that everyone was willing to pitch in and help you get your perfect hair. I'd definitely recommend this studio to anyone that's looking for Instagram-worthy hair. One other bonus is that this studio is surrounded between a Starbucks, a chocolatier, AND a macaron shop so you can set up for a perfect day of pampering. Enjoy ladies!",positive
"I've been looking for a salon to fix my hair for the past year. I've gotten numerous recommendations from friends/colleagues but nothing caught my eye until one of my colleagues recommended Lisa Dinh. I stalked their instagram and was in love with what I saw. I didn't have a preference for a stylist because they all seemed AMAZING. I booked the soonest weekend appointment I could get with any stylist. When the morning of the appointment came, I got a call saying my stylist was sick, however, Lisa and her assistant Rian would be available to do my hair. My hair was previously dyed brown and has since grown out a lot and it turned brassy/super orange. They both did an outstanding job and rescued my hair! Rian began with a consultation and assessed my hair. They really listen to what you want and will tell you what's achievable. I told them I wasn't comfortable going too light. I'm pretty low maintenance/lazy and I wanted something natural but with dimension. They did a colour correction, toned it, added lowlights, blowdried and styled it in 4 hours (it honestly went by so fast!) My total before tip was $339. Although Lisa did my hair with Rian, my appointment was with a new talent stylist and Lisa honoured that pricing. I was so happy with how my hair turned out and when Lisa showed me a picture of my hair, I was shocked and couldn't believe that it was really my hair! I've gotten so many compliments; I'm addicted and I can't wait to return in a couple of months and go even lighter! Atmosphere: It's sleek, modern, and busy in there. You can tell that the girls are like one big family. They joke, they laugh, and they have fun while maintaining professionalism and quality work. Lisa, as the owner, is also very hands on with the work - wiping down mirrors, sweeping hair etc. She's always checking up on the girls and clients just to see if everything is going well. It's great to see that in a business owner and you can tell she is truly passionate about her business.",positive
"I went in for a hair appointment not really knowing what to except, I have seen all the pics from their Instagram page and was confident I made the right choice to get my hair done here. I have previous gone to a different salon which always did a good job on my hair but due to the colour I wanted this time I wanted to try a salon I knew would get the job done. When I walked into the salon I was greeted by Lisa who is such a doll, she took my jacket for me and gave me a robe to protect my clothes. I had booked an appointment with Yorsiny who happens to be amazing at her job and goes above and beyond to make her clients happy. Upon starting the session I advance I wanted to go with a grey/silver tone but due the fact that my hair originally is black it may not be attainable because I would need to be super blonde. She advised me it may not be possible which I understood and just stated would like to go lighter either way. 5 hours in the chair and with help with Rian my hair turned out better then what I excepted, I was able to get the grey tone that I wanted and I am super in love with my hair colour now. Not only were the women working there amazing but the atmosphere and the environment of the salon is just very inviting, I will def be coming back in the future to have all my hair need meet from the beautiful and talented women from this salon.",positive
"Current update... been my go to salon for the past 2 years and that has NOT changed. My favorite hair stylists are still Olivia with the addition of Kathy now. Recently went in for an overdue appointment, had never tried fashion colour before and Kathy did not disappoint! Got a ton of compliments and I love it and would do it again.",positive
"I've been a long time customer of Lisa's studio and every penny spent here is worth it. Always book in advance so you have a spot! Since going here I've had Lisa, Olivia, Jessica, Aaron, Yorsiny and April assist/cut/dye my hair. I would recommend any members!",positive
Kathy Tran was great! Love my color. Everyone was really friendly and Kathy lightened my hair without damaging it. Really happy with how it turned out!,positive
"I have dark brown asian hair with medium-fine texture. It's all virgin and it goes down to my mid back. I booked with Jessica and we went with beige blonde babylights while leaving my roots natural. The process took 3.5 hours from beginning to end - foils, wash, tone, wash, blow dry and style. I am thrilled with the overall experience and outcome. I knew I'd go lighter but was still surprised at how light Jessica was able to get me! The cost of everything was $280 before tips. I expected this price - you get what you pay for: assurance and quality! Everyone was very friendly and Lisa is very personal and attentive, despite being the owner. She walked by and saw some colour on my face and wiped it off for me, asked me if I wanted a refill for my tea and more. Notes/recommendations: - shop for your shampoos (Jessica recommended: Loreal silver shampoo, Joico purple shampoo and Shimmer lights purple shampoo...but keep in mind I am not trying to maintain grey hair. If you're going grey, go with Fanola purple shampoo) before your appointment so that you're not scrambling afterwards. - Buy a wet brush! (the brand ""Wet brush Pro"" is amazing) And buy a detangler. I was quite surprised how tangled my hair became when it got wet, despite it being quite smooth when dry. - Buy your shampoos and brushes from Winners..they have an abundance of Joico products and they are the cheapest. - Maintaining your hair will be $$ and effort! Products alone could add up to another $100",positive
"I've been here three times and all three times I've had excellent experiences. The girls were really knowledgeable and knew what they were doing. Very pricey but then again, it is your hair and what you pay is what you get. The overall health of my hair would have been much worst at a cheaper salon (and after three appointments, my hair is still pretty healthy!). My hair also turned out exactly how I wanted during each session. I am so looking forward to my next visit!",positive
"Thank-you Samantha for doing an amazing job with my hair. Also, thank-you for being so kind and patient. I was a little late and I came sweating! But you approached my hair as if I wasn't sweating my soul out (it was really hot and I walked from Dupont station.. lol). I love my hair so much - I've only coloured my hair twice before at other salons and both times before I left feeling pretty disappointed.. BUT NOT THIS TIME AROUND. I LOVE MY HAIR SO MUCH. THANK-YOU SAMANTHA! YOU WERE AMAZING!!! I saw on facebook just now that Samantha will be leaving the salon soon which makes me sad because I was looking forwards to seeing her again to touch up my hair in the future. :( But as I was looking around the salon today, I'm sure I will be in great hands with the others working at LIsa DInh's. Everyone was so friendly and everyone's hair was amazinggggggg wow! :') thanks again for making me look so good!!!!!!",positive
"This was my first experience with Lisa's studio. I came across them on instagram and have been on the look out for a hair salon that was able to achieve an extremely cool toned ashy blonde/ almost silver tone on dark black hair which is often difficult to achieve. Every hair colourist who I found that I took a liking to their work was from California- That is until I came across Lisa's page. I looked at all of the staff members' pages and decided Olivia was my choice. I booked 4 months in advance and finally got my hair done earlier this week. I cannot be happier with my hair colour. I can say I've never walked out of a hair appointment thrilled-but that has changed. As expensive as this place this, I've found my new colourist. She spent 5 hours on my hair and was well attended to. If you're concerned about the price, all I can say is, there is a reason why you don't often see hair colour as beautifully done as this on the streets everyday. The way Olivia blended/ achieved the blonde and super ashy silver tones in my hair just from one session pleasantly surprised me. I showed Olivia a picture of the colour I wanted and she explained to me that I'd have to do a few more sessions to achieve it, which I understand. Although the balayage ombré I ended up with looks different from the picture I showed her- I'm 100% okay with that because they're artists and one artist will put their own unique spin on their piece of work, which is what she did and it looks fantastic. I also knew I wanted to purchase the right products to properly maintain the colour and expressed to Olivia that I was looking for products. She made sure to write down the products she'd recommends and didn't push to sell my the products in the studio which I appreciate. I ended up getting one of their purple shampoos and going to out and purchasing the recommended shampoo and conditioner that I can use on a more frequent basis. Before I went to my first appointment, I'd already booked my second because of the long wait list, which is okay with me. I'd ask seen Olivia's work and trusted her so I was pretty positive I'd be happy with the results. I received so many compliments on my hair. I couldn't be happier!",positive
"Wow.. Where do I even begin? I have never felt more horrified, upset, and belittled in my entire salon-going life. Ladies, please spend your hard earned money ELSEWHERE. I sat in the stylist, Jessica's chair for 5 hrs while both her and the SALON OWNER, LISA, not only made fun of my shampooing habits, but openly threw insulting jokes about my hair's reaction to the bleach for the entire time they were bleaching my hair. (3 hrs long...) Jessica never asked for my name or offered a glass of water for the entire visit. I closed my eyes for portions of the visit and instead of politely saying, ""excuse me"", she POKED me to get me to the rinsing station. The salon is dirty dusty, and dumpy- looks like they just gave up on cleaning after the grand opening. I finished my sandwich and was crinkling my garbage. The stylists noticed me looking around for a garbage can and never bothered to show me one. I ended up tossing it on the table myself. For a salon who is so friendly on social media, you sure are a bunch of miserable bullies who think too highly of yourselves. Honestly, you're just hair stylists, not Jesus walking on the Nile River. Take note, ladies: do not come unless you're the type that enjoys being insulted and treated like dirt.",negative
"Jess did such an amazing job, everything was perfect and she was the sweetest! Their team was also very helpful and friendly throughout the process. I was a little hesitant at first since I've always had trust issues with people working on my hair, but she ensured everything was what I wanted and the end result was exactly how I pictured it would be. Can't thank her enough for the beautiful job she's done, will definitely be going back :)",positive
Sam did a great job my in hair. She was super attentive and so were everyone else at the salon. They're like a little family and they're so excellent when it comes to customer service. I loved it so much. Everyone is so friendly and nice. I will be a lifetime customer from now on!!!' Highly recommend them. Lisa and her team are beyond awesome,positive
"I stumbled upon Lisa's instagram a couple years ago and booked my first session with her in December of 2015. My first session with her was in her at-home salon and let me tell you - she was humble and kind then, and she is still humble and kind now. Her hard work and passion really shows. You aren't JUST a client to her, you're more than that. I've had my hair done by Lisa, Olivia, and my previous 2 sessions have been with Jess. They all really value their clients and put in 110%. They take their time with you and are very honest with you (ex: number of sessions it may take to achieve your desired colour). It might take a couple hours to get your hair done but you truly get what you pay for (bring your laptop, theres free wifi). It's amazing looking at the progress Lisa has made with her studio, what started off with just her has now grown into a small team of talented hairstylists! I'm gonna be getting my hair done by them even when i'm an old lady with grey hairs and a walking stick :)",positive
"I'm going to start off my review by saying I literally have nothing but good things to say about this salon! I came with my best friend to get our hair done for our vacation. We both got balayage highlights and asked for low maintenance colouring. My natural hair is jet black and on top of that I dyed my hair with black box dye, which created more difficulty. I showed my stylist (Sam Mcgin) what I wanted to achieve but I said it was okay if it was not achievable, considering what I've done to my hair in the past. After a 5 hour session I walked out of that salon with the biggest smile on my face because Sam's work exceeded my expectations! I will definitely come back to Lisa Dinh's studio for future touch ups and colouring! Everyone there was welcoming and passionate about their work which was so nice to see! I'm not the type to spend too much money on my hair but for the service and results that I got from this salon, it was worth every dollar!!",positive
"I am so happy I stumbled across Lisa's instagram page back in 2014!! Since then I have visited her home and new studio I think 5 times total for colour/cut and I am so so so glad I went through my hair journey with them. They're friendly, helpful, and I never felt rushed during the consultation process. I first did a balayage highlights with Olivia when I still had years of brown box dye in my hair, and worked up my courage to do a full on blonde balayage ombre with Lisa before leaving to study abroad. I was really shocked at how light the blonde was, so Lisa offered to tone it darker within the week if I didn't like it (but I ended up loving it!) When I came back, I did a touch up and toned darker with Olivia and have had touch up toners/haircuts with Samantha in the past half year as I transition back to my natural brown-black roots. Aaron is also great at assisting! I truly feel that no matter who I was able to squeeze in an appointment with, they all displayed amazing attention to detail and I am always thankful they are patient enough to deal with my super thick hair lol. It's pretty awesome to see their team grow over the years and I'm confident that all future salon staff will meet your expectations to the best of their ability. If you have a style in mind, make sure you have done your research and bring in examples for reference of what you want your hair to look like, as well as less ""dramatic"" back-ups in case that level of bleaching etc. just isn't possible for your hair. If they decline to do your particular request, just know it's the best decision for your hair health at this point! A tiny drawback for me is just how busy they are - book way in advance if you want colouring services but if you're just looking for a drop-in cut this is probably not for you since pretty much all of the staff specialize in colouring.",positive
"Everythint about my experience at this salon was amazing. As someone with thick wavy hair, its always been a challenge to find someone to do my hair well. However, at lisadinhs this was not the case. From the moment I walked in, I was offered muffins, conversation and someone to take my coat away. As a sat in the chair, my colourist/stylist, who was Olivia, listened to what I wanted done (ash beige balayage highlights), she asked it I had any pictures and recreated the whole thing. She is a very sweet girl and it was very enjoyable to talk to her throughout the process. At the end, when she was styling my hair she also allowed me to show her a pic of the way I wanted it done (tousled beach waves) and without a doubt she was able to recreate that too. The final product was amazing. Olivia also explained how to maintain my ash hair and offered me multiple product choices that I could buy, which was very appreciated. Also- In the process of my hair session, despite the fact that I wasn't booked with Lisa, she greeted herself to me and kept asking me if everything was going alright/if I needed anything. I thought this was a very sweet and warming touch as she is the owner and was busy with another client but she still made the time to make sure my experience went well. Overall, I am so happy with my hair and the experience here. This was my first time here but I will definitely be coming back.",positive
"I had my hair cut and coloured by Samantha couple of weeks ago (Dec. 16). The Good: First of all, I loved how friendly the salon was. Everyone was welcoming. Samantha was also very nice and easy to talk to. Samantha did an AMAZING job with colouring my hair. I told her what I wanted (natural with some lighter brown highlights/balayage) and she did exactly that. She kept checking in to make sure that the lightening was going okay. She never complained about how much hair I had (I have lots of thick hair) and was very pleasant throughout the whole process. I have received many compliments when my hair is curled. The not as good: I wasn't as happy with my hair cut. I didn't realize how odd my hair looked from the back when it's straight till a week after my hair cut (when someone made a comment about it). I specifically requested for a hair cut that looked good straight or curled and right now, it only looks curled. Since she is the professional, I completely trusted her when she said it would look better more blunt and not thinned out so that I have more volume. And for most people that's probably true. But because I have straight and thick hair, my hair looks quite messy with the blunt cut. I will post a photo from the back. Also, my bangs are brighter in colour than the rest of my hair... I told her near the beginning that I like side swept bangs and also that I like having lighter colours to frame my face. I guess I should have clarified that that does noT include my bangs... Will I go back? Heck yes! I will recommend this place for balayage and hair colour! I still love the colour of my hair for the most part. But next time, I will likely get it cut somewhere else beforehand.",positive
"I really wanted to love this place after researching so many hair salons and their portfolios. When I got there, no one was around to greet me. After awkwardly sitting down, I waited for Olivia to come - I showed pictures of subtle balayage but she said I should go for something lighter. I insisted I did not want to look like the typical brunette blonde - anyway, at the end it looked like that. I still trusted her because she is the professional here. During the process, I felt she wasn't friendly and brushed my hair very roughly - to the point where my hair was elasticky and breaking. We all know that our hair's at its weakest when it's 1) wet and 2) after chemical processing. Lisa helped brushed out my hair as well but she was definitely gentle and patient with my hair, taking her time and not yanking out knots. In the end, I wasn't happy with my colour, so Olivia ended up putting a toner on for a bit and I left with happier colour but with broken hair. I know that this salon has a policy where you can go back and have them fix anything you want free if you're not satisfied, but I didn't want to risk getting my hair in even worse shape. Oops I almost forgot to mention, my hair went back to being light after 2 weeks...... I did not brush my hair for atleast 2 weeks, especially when it was wet, any slight tugging would rip the strands. To be honest, i was really scared. I had to do hair treatments every day for the next 3 weeks and lots of olaplex at another salon, and had them correct my hair colour as well. I regret to write this review and I know some ppl have their bad days at their job, but if you're passionate about your work, your mood shouldn't get in the way of quality work. I warned many friends from coming here thereafter and suggested the other salon which actually fixed my hair. ------------------ Thanks Lisa, I appreciate your feedback. During the consultation, I was asked when it was the last time I had my hair coloured. I get annual straightening perm done followed by hair colouring and highlights for many many years now. I did not mention the perm because I was i) not asked about it, and ii) it did not cross my mind that it would be an issue. Yes, it was a miscommunication, and I know these things can happen. Please understand that I didn't want to come back to fix my hair because I could not have taken another risk right before my wedding. I know you work hard at your shop and you want the best representation of it. I also really wanted to believe that because it puts me at stake. Regardless of what happened, thank you for your reply and kind concern.",negative
"After having a bad experience in another salon earlier in the year (note my other review LOL) my bf got me an appointment with Lisa Dinh! My hair before was over processed, banded and pretty brassy.. You can tell Lisa knows what she is doing and she warned me before starting that my hair was very damaged and we might now be able to achieve the look I wanted. Nonetheless, my hair actually reacted pretty well and we finished my hair in about 4-5 hours! My hair has no yellow what's so ever and it is BLENDED like a dream! Another thing I loved was that despite her having another client, she still constantly checked up on me to make sure I was okay and to see how the process was going. I am super happy with my hair and get compliments daily about it. Thanks Lisa!!",positive
"I had my hair done with Sam at the studio and it was a pretty awesome experience! Everyone is really friendly in the salon and even though I'm pretty shy, I ended up chatting with them :) my hair looks gorgeous and I can't thank Sam enough for the unicorn hair. (Dyed it a grey/pink mix) Sam was great - she asked me about my hair history and then went over how she'd be doing my hair. Not only that, she would explain each step as she started them and I really loved that. She offered me tea/water many a times which was sweet and even offered to help pick me up some food since I hadn't eaten that day :) One thing I particularly love about the studio was that it was really clean and designed very nicely. Not only that, the salon wasn't packed. Even though they are always booked up, they really care about their clients and try to ensure that quality is given for each one by ensuring they aren't booked to too many different people. I've been too many salons and half the time the stylist is working on 3 other girls/guys so this was really a big surprise! I love that everyone seems so down to earth :) Everyone also has really great looking hair their which is always a good sign I personally think! I kept staring at Lisa because her hair colour was just so pretty! Aaron assisted and he was really friendly as well! Styled my hair really nicely and the head massage was Overall, my experience was a really good one. I went in with high expectations and came out very satisfied. Normally I come out of the salon feeling disappointed but this was the one time I didn't :) I just wish I could snag appointments easier :( either way, don't hesitate to book an appointment!",positive
I had my hair recently dyed by Lisa and she did an amazing job. I always wanted the ashy blonde balayage and she recreated the exact colour I wanted in a picture I showed her. Lisa took the time to fix up the previous dyed job I had and gave me a brand new look. Her assistant Aaron was also very personable and gave a great hair wash with a massage. Thanks for everything!,positive
"It was my first time at the salon and I've been browsing on Instagram the work that is done at the salon. I've always wanted to come in and experience it myself, so I finally did and I was completely happy and satisfied. Jessica was truly amazing and talented for someone with one year of experience. I truly trusted her and with the results I got, I loved it! By far the best salon I've ever been to.",positive
"I've been anticipating a chance to have my hair done by Lisa for quite some time, but she was based in Mississauga when I discovered her work, but when she opened her salon in Toronto I was trilled! I just recently had my hair cut and coloured my Lisa her self and I could not be any more happier with how it turned out. I did have a different colour style that I intentionally wanted but i trusted Lisa to do what she does best and allow her to colour my hair how she felt would suit my hair and the colour treatments I had done before. The salon itself is easy to find and its very clean and classy. I would recommend any girl looking to have her hair done professionally to book with Lisa! She is very busy and always booked for months so you do have to keep in mind that your going to be booking for months ahead. She also brought her cute adorable puppy Toby to the salon! I enjoyed his presence and so did my boyfriend who came along with me. Follow her on Insta @lisadinhhairstudio to check out her work and salon! I admire her work and passion for what she does girl power!",positive
"Lisa Dinh Hair Studio does not disappoint! From the overall friendliness of girls at the salon & assistant, knowledgeable colorists, to the fantastic results, these girls are the best. I've gone twice, recommended them numerous times and will definitely be a returning customer!",positive
"My first time going to the studio and it was amazing! Lisa was the first to greet me and she was super nice and welcoming. The studio's beautiful and a great open space so you can see how they work with other clients. I was referred to this hair salon by a friend who had her balayage done by Olivia. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to schedule a balayage early because their schedule is fully booked! However, I was able to schedule a wash and style with Olivia. Chau, who handles all their appointments, was really quick in replying and was able to book me an appointment for a balayage for a later date. When I met Olivia, she asked me what I wanted for my hair. I explained that I really needed a haircut however it wasn't part of the booking. But Olivia made it happen! She was able to squeeze a haircut, wash and styling within 30 minutes. She's quick and amazing! She also asked me about my hair and past dye jobs so I felt that she really wanted to know what my hair's gone through After creeping on their Instagram and finally experiencing it first hand, I can understand now why it takes months to get a booking. It was well worth the wait!",positive
"After years of stalking Lisa on Instagram (@lisadinhhairstudio) and seeing her share her work/hair transformations online, I was finally able to have a hair transformation of my own! I've wanted to color my hair with Lisa for such long time so when I heard that she was opening her own salon in Toronto I was super excited! I immediately booked my appointment online around February and to my surprise Lisa was already booked for almost 3 months! I decided to wait it out and booked a balayage ombre session with her for early May ...and let me tell you SHE IS WORTH THE WAIT. Lisa was super nice and friendly upon my arrival to the salon. Before she started coloring my hair she asked me about my hair history (ie. previous dyes/box dyes) and what I wanted to do with my hair. She was really easy to talk to and thoroughly listened to what I wanted. To make it easier for her, I also showed her some pictures of the color I wanted! My main goal for the session was to get rid of my brassy ends and get it as light and ashy as possible. My general expectations for the session was quite low. My hair was quite damaged and I had Asian hair so I thought the lightest I would see my hair after the blow dry would be a nice caramel/brown ombre and that I would need a couple more sessions before I could achieve a nice ashy tone....but Lisa surprised me and exceeded my expectations!!! Lisa worked her magic and got me to beautiful ashy tones!! I was so pleased and happy with the results I couldn't believe my eyes!! The difference from the before and after is huge and I am ever so grateful for Lisa. The session took about 4 hours because I had shorter hair. Overall, I would definitely recommend Lisa. She is very professional and knows exactly what she is doing. I have received so many compliments on my hair and have told all my friends and family about her salon and they have looked into booking with her and the other stylists. Lisa is the best in Toronto and she will be the only one I trust with my hair. I will definitely be a long time client and be coming back :)",positive
"I've had my hair done by both Lisa and Olivia. They both do an amazing job, they work with you and if you have hair goals they help you achieve it, but are realistic. They never lie to you, and if they can't do something or it'll take multiple sessions they'll tell you. Which I think is great, because you need stylists who are honest with you. They ask new clients lots of questions on their hair history. Don't lie! Be honest! They can't give you what you want unless you tell them the truth! Check out their instagrams, you'll see the works of art they create. Lisa is also expanding and hiring more stylists. Anyone who Lisa hires will be amazing, so you can't go wrong with whoever you book with. You won't be disappointed. You can also get your brows and nails done by Janny. She's a miracle worker. One of the best and friendliest places to get your hair done in Toronto. You'll love it!",positive
"best hair salon everrr! i went to lisa before she opened up the salon and i gotta say that she's the best hair colorist i've ever been to. not only that, but she cares so much about her clients and the work she does is amazing! 10/10 will go back!",positive
"As others have stated Mary is the best! I moved here almost 9 years ago and spent the first 6 going from one FH salon to the next. Then...I found Mary!! Best cut I have ever had. She is patient and so nice to chat with. After she opened up her salon I found her again and absolutely love her. She now does my color and eyebrows in addition to cut and style and has been flawless. We did a semi ombré thing last time and not only did I love it, but received tons of compliments and Scottsdale friends asking for my colorist. I have to mention that I really like the home salon feel, not intimidating whatsoever, and her adorable dog Betty is so sweet. Writing this reminds me I am due for a cut.",positive
"I have a lot of hair. It's curly, and I am always skeptical to try someone new. Well, it was time. I've lived here for over a year, and I couldn't keep waiting to visit home for my long, overdue haircuts. Mary Hatch Peters has been a true blessing. She listens to what style you would like to achieve, and she takes her time to ensure it is done to perfection. I believe she is actually the best stylist I have ever had. I truly can't imagine being happier with anyone else. From start to finish, she exceeds five star service. I would highly recommend her whether you are new to town or just in need of a change. She is excellent.",positive
"I'd been going to my regular hair stylist in Scottsdale for many, many years - and after much soul searching, decided to make a change and find someone new, in Fountain Hills, where I live. Not only did Mary come VERY highly recommended by so many people I know and/or know of, but I had already used her styling services a couple months previously for a friend who was having some post-wedding pictures taken, as my gift to them. She made my friend look and feel gorgeous, so I already knew I'd be in good hands! She listened very carefully to what I wanted, made additional recommendations, spent a great deal of time with multiple steps...and not only did I walk out with the best cut and color that I've had in years, but we have a tangible plan as we continue to grow out what I had before and move towards what I really want! Her space is spotless, she is charming and thoughtful - and I always appreciate any place where my dog(s) is/are welcome! She is, quite simply...the best!",positive
"Mary's been my stylist for a little over two years and I couldn't be happier. She's thorough, knowledgable, and so much fun to banter with (an important quality when you spend hours in someone's chair!). She took my hair from dark brown to blonde with no damage. She's brilliant with cuts, as well. Whether you need a trim, a dramatic cut, or a change of color, she's the best stylist I've ever had. As Homer Simpson would say... 9 thumbs up!",positive
"Discovered Mary from one of my FB Groups - you know, you're looking for someone local and do that shout-out to your FB friends. Mary came highly recommended. I've been once and really did like her. It was a simple trim, but I was ready to (gasp) add bangs and she helped talk me through it. She's super nice and listened to me as I explained what I wanted, and showed her some photos. We talked through the pros and cons before I decided to go with it. She started me out with just a little bit and I went back a week later and added some more (at no charge). The space is clean. She's super nice. I'm a fan and have my follow up trim scheduled for next week!",positive
"I do very much love going here. I love going to Mikee, The Scottish Guy. He always gives me the best haircuts. He takes his time and listen to what i am looking for. His Hot Towel Shaves are great too. I also love seeing Anka, the owner as she always puts a smile on my face. Thanks Mankind for keeping looking great...",positive
"Michael ""The Scottish Guy"" is the best!!! He has been cutting my hair since November 2016 and I leave extremely happy every time.",positive
"This brings me no pleasure. I was a walk in, being in town and being long overdue for a shave and a haircut, I decided to treat myself. Everyone was very nice, and the shop looked fun. I noted the shave was a luxury service that was advertised at taking 45 minutes. I asked if we could cut some of the luxury time as I didn't want to spend and hour at the salon. They agreed. They assured me corners wouldn't be cut (pun intended), just that they wouldn't do every step of the spa like treatment. I would pay regular price, I assured them, of course. The gentlemen who cut my hair was well groomed, and smelled good and very nice. I'm sure no one wants to be that close to someone who smells bad or has bad breath. But here's the real issue. The services rendered were not only NOT worth the money they were charging, money I'd gladly pay for quality service. It was incompetent. The shave. The shave was the worst. My father is an old school barber, and a straight-razor shaves should take 15-20 minutes for a full beard, max. With all corners cut, this stylist still took 45 minutes, and the shave was not a shave. He wielded the blade and moved it like he didn't know what he was doing. He shaved in small, hesitant moves that were uncomfortable. And because I didn't have my glasses and didn't look into a close mirror after all was said and done, I didn't notice at the time that it was barely a shave. There was not a patch of skin that didnt have some growth on it and many patches of...ugh, look, suffice it to say I had to shave again. The haircut itself was much better being only sub par. Meaning that I had to walk him through a standard short back and sides, slightly longer on top, tighter in the back. A standard ""Mad Men"" style cut that should be easy for someone who knows what he's doing. I touched up some missed strands here and there myself, and will have to get another cut in a couple of weeks. So, avoid.",negative
"Walked in, very friendly atmosphere. Tried something new and got more. Shout out to Michael for giving me an awesome chop.",positive
"It's been a while since I started coming here. It has a lot of thumbs up! It has great atmosphere, the people are cool and kind and they do a great job. The waiting lounge is quite comfy, although I've never waited more than 15 minutes. With the haircut it includes a nice shampooing with hair and facial massage. They used to do also an amazing hand massage too, which included cold wax that left them feeling as fresh and new as a baby's one might feel... they don't do it anymore. My hair is done by my good friend Nia, who is great, cheerful and we always have an awesome conversation. I also do my pedi and manicure with Toni, who is great too. Besides the good job and exciting conversation she always has good anecdotes to tell me. The only down is the price is (waaaay) expensive. I would also advise on getting an appointment.",positive
"Mankind is awesome. I see Kyle there who is unreal. If you're a guy and are looking for someone who knows how to cut a good and trendy man's cut, you gotta go see him! Check out his instagram account @london_fades. He's a great dude and gives a 10/10 hair cut. Really puts in the time to give a meticulous fade and quality cut.",positive
"Finding a stylist that puts time and effort into your hair is rare these days. I have been to many grooming salons for men and I can say that Mankind is my place now. I travel 45mins from outside the GTA to get my hair cut just because they do it right. Ruth is awesome, she really pays attention to detail and she can tame my curly hair. I would highly recommend this place to all those that value their image.",positive
"Very negative experience. No respect for people's time. I left work early and took a cab to be on time for my appointment. Upon arrival, no one informed me of a delay. 10 minutes after my scheduled appointment I asked what was going on. I was told that there was a slight delay. I left 30 minutes later without a haircut, disappointed that no one had even alluded to it, nor apologized or tried to make things right. Very negative customer experience.",negative
God a giftcard and based on Yelp reviews got a haircut from Tash. She was very friendly and paid a lot of attention to details Overall a good experience,positive
I had been looking for somewhere to get a haircut and straight razor shave since moving to town a year ago. I tried a few others but they don't come close to Mankind. I get the Alpha Male package and straight razor shave with Loraine. The haircut is great - I even got comments at work - and the shave is baby smooth. Combined with the hand and scalp massages I always come out feeling great. Highly recommended.,positive
I decided to go to this place on a whim and I'm happy I did. Tash did an amazing job with my hair. I could tell that she put a lot of thought into it and my hair came out looking incredible! I was a little apprehensive about the extra spa treatment stuff but it was definitely worth it. It was so relaxing after a long day in class. All in all this place is definitely worth the extra cash. I plan on becoming a regular.,positive
"Simply worth every penny. It's a great space, the people were great, and it just seemed very organized and professional. $45 is steep for a simple cut, but it's not a simple cut. It's nice to be pampered a little bit, and the paraffin wax treatment, hand and arm massage and mini facial were quite relaxing. My stylist (Caleb), though not much of a conversationalist, was on another level skill-wise - he really knows how to shape men's hair. Highest praise.",positive
Great cut. Great service. I will definitely be a regular here. Justin was my barber - a great guy with haircutting talent to boot.,positive
"I hadn't heard about this salon until I received complimentary Alpha-male haircut package in a gift bag I received at an event. I was eager to try this place out as I had been getting $15 haircuts at another location that were rushed and never to my satisfaction. I registered for my appointment online and decided to book an appointment with 'Tash'. I'm very happy I did... Not only was she extremely friendly, but she was extremely detail oriented. The paraffin wax treatment, the facial, and the head massage were all perfect. She spent a lot of time on detailing the fade of my hair, and took her time with the cut. Time went by fast as she seemed to enjoy chatting with me, and made me feel very comfortable. After everything was done I was amazed by how great my hair looked. You know how sometimes you get a haircut and feel a little off because you look ""different"".. Tash was able to tailor my hairstyle so that worked with my face, and balanced all my features... I've been getting compliments every day since my haircut and I honestly would never have expected to feel this good from a haircut. It gets better too... They give you a complimentary neck trim after two weeks... I was spending about $20 every three weeks for a mediocre haircut.. Now I'll only have to get a haircut every 5-6 weeks considering how well my haircut is growing out. At the end of the day, I'm paying around the same as I would have been before, except I'm getting a extremely higher quality cut. Check out this salon... You'll be glad you did.",positive
"I have no problem paying more for higher quality goods and services. There's some things that are really worth a higher price. At Mankind, I paid about twice what I can pay for a really good haircut at a few other places in Toronto, outside the downtown core. So, what am I paying extra for at Mankind? They include a paraffin wax treatment, which is nice, but I probably wouldn't really feel like I need every time I get my hair cut. You get a warm towel face treatment. I don't know what else to call it. It's another inclusion that feels slightly pampering, but that I wouldn't say is a must-have for a haircut. I've come to appreciate the simpler experiences. Ultimately, I pay more at Mankind, and the last few times, haven't even come out with a haircut I was altogether happy with. And that's what I went in for in the first place...",negative
"This is an upscale, no-holds-barred haircuttery that's a little more hipster than jock, despite the masculine aura. But that's a good thing. For me the best part is a hairdresser who actually listens to what you want. They have a short but purposeful ""consultation"" before each cut, where you actively share your preferences. I'm kind of picky, but also quiet, and don't like making a fuss, so lazy hairdressers usually do whatever they like. Caleb is a nice, straight-faced Irish guy with terrific attention to detail and he asks lots of questions about what I want, which is great. I found the atmosphere a little stiff and the prices a little steep, but I'm happy to call myself a loyal customer now, based on the supreme service and quality.",positive
"Wow! I arrived here this morning at 1pm and they were busy so I booked an appointment for 3pm. 3pm - Walked in and they gave me some lotion for my hands then dipped it in wax While I was getting my hair shampoo'd, one of the ladies there gave a hand massage. After the shampoo, they give your head a massage and then a facial massage. Whatever they put on your face feels amazing and it's great to have someone massaging your face while the other is massaging your hands (don't know if this happens always or it was just good timing). Hair cut was amazing - I have longer hair for a guy and explained that most barber shops screw it up by making it too short. My hairdresser here (Caleb I think is his name) said that he has been cutting girls hair for 10 years so he's good with long hair. Overall excellent job on the haircut and exactly what I asked for!!! I also got my beard trimmed. This place is a little expensive compared to regular hair cutting spots that I'm used to in the city ($20) and I ended up paying $65 (cut, wash, and beard trim) and giving a 25% tip so it was $80. Well worth it!",positive
"Due to my profession I can find myself traveling for long periods of time. Sometimes a haircut is required while on the road. This place was right near the top of Yelps list of suggested Mens Salons. Upon entering, I was greeted with a smile, and as a walk in only had to wait about 15 minutes to get a cut. The front lounge was quite comfortable and there was an extremely large TV with sports on. When my stylist came to greet me and take me to her station, I began to describe the trim I was after. For some time now I have been looking for something new and really like input from the stylist about what they would suggest. A strong factor that does not give this Salon a 5 star rating is the fact they had absolutely not books of sample haircuts. This is the first time I have asked if they have a book of sample cuts and was told ""no we don't"". As a male, we only have a few real options for cuts, and seeing what you can be offered on a book seems like a pretty basic thing a salon for men should have. The cut that I left with was absolutely to my satisfaction, although it didn't offer that ""new look"" I've been searching for. If you are wanting something special changed about your hair or are looking for something extremely specific, make sure to show up with your own pictures. I was also impressed with the amount of detail the stylist paid to cleaning up any remaining hairs lingering around on my neck.",positive
"I'm writing this not as someone who has ever had a service from Mankind (obviously), but as someone who sends her man to the studio and has always been happy with the results. My fiancé is very low-maintenance, and for the first couple years of dating he would continue to visit the barber that he has been seeing for the large majority of his life whenever he was in need of a trim. When he made the move downtown to live with me, he realized it was going to get harder and harder to get out to Etobicoke to see a barber with limited weekend hours, and he would let his hair grow to unmanageable lengths while he tried to figure out a time that worked best for everyone. Enter Mankind. From the get-go, they made him feel super comfortable, even though the idea of going to a salon admittedly weirded him out. The vibe is comfortable and classy, with overside leather chairs, punchy artwork, and a large flat-screen TV in the waiting area. The music is quite loud, but the it keeps the energy up. We have never waited long for him to get in for an appointment, and each stylist he's seen (he's not picky) has made sure they're very clear on what he wants before they even begin anything. The first time around he turned down the parrafin wax treatment and the face toner, but quickly warmed up to the idea when he realized that yes, he could in fact do with a bit of pampering. When he leaves, he always looks so debonair and smells amazing. I have no idea what kind of product they use, but I couldn't stop smelling his hair and face after his last visit. I'm just so grateful to have found a place that he is comfortable with, is reasonably priced, and conveniently located near work. He will definitely be back, probably in less than 2 weeks for his complimentary touch-up. I only wish that $45 got me that many services when I get my hair done!",positive
"I have been to the Eglinton location twice now, the first time gets 5 stars, the more recent gets 1, so that averages a 3. Save you the story, but my cut near closing time was rushed, the stylist distracted, and confusion over the cost with not a hint of apology from the receptionist. I have been in touch with them since and they've agreed to make things right, so good on the owner for that. Really depends on your stylist I guess. The ""Alpha Male"" package comes to $50 and change, and in my opinion is a good value.",negative
"I REFUSE to give this butcher shop even a one star review but I had no choice because it wouldn't let me post review otherwise!!! ABSOLUTELY HORRENDOUS! I bought my husband a TeamBuy voucher for the 'alpha male with man hands (wash, cut, style, hot towel, head/hand massage, with paraffin and manicure'. The appointment was booked for 3:45 pm. First problem is that the Richmond St. W location is a cross between a gay Mexican nightclub and 'A Night at the Roxbury' movie. They were even literally playing the soundtrack to 'A Night at the Roxbury'. Second problem was, as I said my husband's appointment was booked for 3:45 pm and NO ONE TENDED TO HIM until AFTER 5:00 pm. How DARE you book someone and not provide the service for close to 1 1/2 hours AFTER their scheduled appointment! BAD BUSINESS PRACTICE! THIRD and MOST IMPORTANT - the MORON who was cutting his hair, the butcher - I mean barber, had the STUPIDITY and IGNORANCE to grab my husband's hair at the root on the TOP of his head and cut it COMPLETELY OFF! Not only did he not ask first but he then turned to my husband and asked ""if it was ok?!?!"". It seems this barber got his schooling on YouTube!! Note: my husband usually wears his hair on the top of his head at 3 inches in length. Not 1/4 of an inch. Needless to say after this jerk-off cut a HUGE chunk out there was NO solution other than for him to basically give my husband a military/police style hair cut/buzz cut!!! My husband was so humiliated and furious that as SOON as the hair butchering was done he left immediately without saying a word. He did not stay for any of the other services offered in the package. Let me tell you, if I was there and this A**hole did that to my husband in front of me, someone would be humilated and hurting more than my husband!! I am BEYOND livid with this CHOP SHOP and not only plan on speaking with the manager and owner, but I have filed a complaint with the BBB and TeamBuy! STAY AWAY FROM THIS BUTCHER SHOP!!!!!",negative
"This place is awesome. So i'm bald and don't have the need for a haircut. My problem is, I have bad bad feet, and after a trip to NY, or with wear and tear, my feet get bad and uncomfortable, and a pedicure fixes that. Except most places you go to, half ass it, and just do a cosmetic pedicure. It cost $30, but Emma who was taking care of me, spent an honest to god, hour and 20 minutes fixing my feet up. No extra charge, no complaints, no half ass job. The best pedicure I've had. Some girls I knew were jealous that they couldn't go there. The old school chair was cool too, and the service to make sure you're comfortable was top notch. This place is really different. +1 to the management and team there!",positive
"Amazing! That word sums it all up nicely. This was my first trip to any sort of male-oriented salon. Their description, ""Grooming studio for men"" is a nice tight way of saying ""Come hang out in our man cave and get your hair cut"". I didn't know what to expect walking into this place, but I was thoroughly blown away. The waiting area looks like the ultimate man's living room. The receptionist offered to take my jacket and make myself at home. There's a leather sofa, a coffee table with some manly magazines on it, a giant flat-screen TV playing sports with also a PS3 hoked up, and a bar. Yes a bar. That bar is used for them to offer you a drink from which is included in the ""Alpha Male"" service package. When it's your turn, the stylist takes you over to a chair and you have a quick consultation about what you'd like done. After that you're over to a station where you wash your hands and they do a paraffin wax hand dip. Next, the stylist will get you seated at the sink. You get a quick facial rub down and you're face is wrapped in a hot towel. While your face and hands are basking in the warmth you get your hair washed and scalp massaged. Once this is all complete it's on to the cut. The cut was the most attention my hair has ever gotten in my entire life. My hair is pretty short, so it mostly involves clippers to get it cut. I'm not sure how many different guards she used but she sure made sure everything was blended perfectly. Best haircut I've ever had. The Alpha Male service is $45 before tax and tip which is extremely reasonable in my opinion for everything you get. I highly recommend this place to any guy or ladies, this would make a great gift for a man in your life. Nov 30-day challenge 15/30",positive
"Easily my best experience with a salon to date. I have long curly hair, and quite commonly I find that stylists don't cut it accordingly. At Mankind, I enjoyed a fantastic cut tailored specifically to my hair type from Anisa, a stylist who specializes in curly hair. It's definitely my favourite cut I've ever had. On top of this, the experience was excellent. The additional services that come with the cut make it an actual experience, and the friendly and very intelligent staff made me feel comfortable even though it was my first time at their establishment. I highly recommend this to anyone looking for a change, and a great hair experience!",positive
"Here was a place I really enjoyed visiting for a number of reasons. For the most part, it's because of my hair stylist started working at this new ""Studio Grooming for Men"" I have been with her for over 7 years and, although there are only 2 other places she has worked, I felt the most at ease showing up at this place for the first time. They have an old meets new feel to the place without making you feel at home. What I got out of this place is a new idea that really works for people like me. By this I mean that I like the whole grooming part of getting a haircut which I'm not afraid to admit as long as it's from a place like Mankind. Now, I'm not quite sure if I'll use all their services, yet they offer a few extras that I enjoy such as a hand/wax treatment while you get your cut and a hot towel that is incredibly relaxing. Another nice touch is the drink they offer you on the way in. They have a 65"" screen TV which is hooked up to a Playstation which makes this place so chill. They also offer things like men's manicures ""The Man Hands"", massage table ""Feeling Kneady"" in a quiet room area but the coolest thing that I haven't seen since my grandfather used to take me to his barber is their straight blade shave. this place doesn't smell like chemical products nor is there a thousand people running around chaotically. One feature that I thought was great was the TV's at every grooming station so that you don't miss the game or whatever... There prices were all on their website so there were no surprises and I thought they were great value. A place to check out, for sure.",positive
"This is the worst place to get you hair coloured . So my mother in law goes to this place and it's quite close to where we live and one day I was nearby and I consulted with May I showed her a picture of balayage that I wanted to get done and she say say no problem you come I'll do it for you it will take 3-4 hours so I decided to get book an appointment and came by. I showed her picture the day off and asked her of possible outcomes that could happen so she chose a picture and said we'll do this. She coerced me into doing an oil treatment to so this whole duration I hadn't seen my hair even once after the bleaching toning and treatment . And I am a hair stylist too I noticed she didn't do the balayage technique on me instead did the slicing method so I though maybe it something I don't know about. The next thing you know she starts to dry my hair and it looks nothing like balayage, my highlight are coming straight from my root and they aren't blond the are orange and it looks nothing like the picture I showed her. She turned my hair green instead of ash blonde as you may notice. I am so disappointed and scarred and it's week away from my wedding I don't know what to do? I went to ask for a refund and she refused this is so unprofessional. She wanted me colour her hair again to to just refund me half my money can you imagine? You think I would trust her after she did something like that? So I told her to keep my money as charity and this was the most unprofessional job ever! Please don't ever trust an asian woman to do your hair ! I can't never trust another hair stylist ever aga",negative
"My stylist was in a hurry so she gave me an uneven cut. Although I did show her the picture and told her to not cut my hair short, she did the exact opposite. Also on top of getting a weird uneven haircut, I realized that she never used a shaver, just the trimmer to clean the hair on my neck and around my ears I guess I was supposed to guide them through all this. Will go to a different place next time.",negative
After having read great reviews for them on yelp. I decided to get my hair cut here ! They were really patient and took care of each and every details of the cut and did a great job. Thanks to their accuracy .,positive
"I went to May Hui's Hair Design yesterday evening calling in around 630 when they close at 7pm. May was so gracious and said she would take care of me. And did she ever!! May was ""aMAYzing. She patiently cut my hair and showed me ways of styling my hair after my haircut. She gave me ideas on colouring and what would best work for my hair. What a pleasant experience. When it comes to customer care, May was ""bangs"" on!",positive
"I've been going to this salon for the last 10 years. May is the only person I trust with my hair. Her cut and coloring technique is fantastic. She listens to what you want, and even makes suggestions as to what would work for you. Even though I've moved away from Mississauga, I visit this salon every time I'm in town. Joanna does haircuts for my brother and dad, who have also been at this same salon for years. Many times I've gone to May (after ruining my hair at other salons) and asked her to fix my hair. Without telling her what I want, she immediately knows what needs to be done, and does it in average and cheaper prices. They're really a great salon with excellent skill for the price. I highly recommend this salon to anyone in the Mississauga area. You will not be disappointed!",positive
"Woodbine mall Melonhead, i had the worst experience, besides them not knowing how to work with children, they were rough, and didnt get the job done properly.",negative
I called on a Saturday at 4pm for my one year old's first haircut - they accommodated us for 5:30pm and we were even a few minutes later than that. The place was empty of customers because we were the last clients but the staff remained and were very courteous. Our son needed a boyish haircut since he got curls and people kept thinking he's a girl. Our stylists name is Natalia and she did a fantastic job on him. He remained calm through the whole haircut but got upset with the trimmer because of the noise - still overall it went smoothly. They provided a first hair cut certificate with a picture The place is clean and have many fun seats to choose from and toys / tv shoes to distract. We were done in 20 mins. Based on previous reviews I think we happened to get lucky with this visit and stylist. They made sure we were happy with the visit and pictures taken and did not make us feel rushed.,positive
"I rate Melonhead ( Woodbine Centre) -0 score...Sept. 16, 2017...time: 12:30-1:30, it was the most horrible and disgusting exeperience we ever had with my 4 yr old daughter...we expected to be treated equal with other customers but they just let us wait definitely waste our time and effort and even our patience for ""NOTHING"" beware of these old lady wearing eyeglasses and the chubby one because they might give you hope and ended up nothing and going home disappointed and angry and the worst part they make my daughter go home UNHAPPY because they don't give her time to do what they were suppose to be doing in the first place...instead the lady who took our appointment just walk away for lunch and while one employee is still working with another customer the chubby one just stay at the register area and say nothing until I say we can't wait any longer coz we still have somewhere to go to and I expect that she should've said oh ""I'm sorry""about that but or try to say something but its not she never say a word until were no longer on her watch....My gosh!! Can you imagine they were very unprofessional...never ever recommed this location...ever!!!",negative
Don't bring your kids here. My daughter has wavy hair and we have given these guys 3 shots at doing a good job. No dice. Each time her hair is cut unevenly. I could do this at home so to pay almost $40 for a bad kids haircut - not worth it. I called and left a message telling them we were not happy and wanted to come get it fixed - they did not call back.,negative
It was a busy day and the staff are fighting and arguing in front of the customers. When I asked for a scissors only cut our stylist suggested that it would take too long. Appointments weren't booked correctly. Pretty much the worst experience we have had with mediocre haircuts as a end result. Consider somewhere else.,negative
"We came here a few weeks ago. They have pretty reasonable hours, but they close promptly at their posted closing time. I looked up this location on their website before I went, so I knew they didn't take any clients 20 minutes before closing. I took a chance and went anyway, they were accommodating, and cut my son's hair (we showed up just at that 20 minutes mark). I did witness an altercation with another potential client who called to say they were coming, but didn't actually show up until 7 minutes to closing, they were not able to accommodate him, and he didn't like that. So the cut is pretty true to their website, you need to be there with your child 20 minutes before otherwise you are better to come another day. Overall it was good.",negative
"Ugh it's taken me too long but here it is. Took my son for his first haircut and it was nothing short of AWFUL. He has curly hair which I mentioned when I booked the appointment and he came out with a bowl cut. I asked them to fix it and he ended up with a short bowl cut. To add insult to injury, it cost me as much as it would if I'd taken him to my high end salon. Never again.",negative
"Melonheads is 5-stars in several departments: friendly service, decor (brightly decorated salon with character chairs including Thomas), free photo and certificate for the first haircut, free hair accessory and glitter hairspray and most importantly to my little one - free lollipop at the end. However, the quality of the haircut is where it falls to 1-star. I know, they're toddlers and don't need perfectly coifed styles. I'm not one of *those* moms who will cry ""They ruined her hair, just ruined it!"". But I think the hair cut should still be quality - one that is not uneven and looks like I took a bowl to her head and trimmed around it. I had to do some of my own maintenance and trimming of longer pieces when we got home.",negative
"This was an absolute disaster. I hesitate to give this review, but the person who cut my son's hair on a Sunday should not be a hairdresser. It was chopped roughly and unevenly all over. It was impossible to see when it was wet but once dry it was unbelievable. I do not want to embarrass him by bringing him back to ask what happened. Please avoid.",negative
Super understanding and helpful with our seriously anti-haircut two year old! They did a great job even though he screamed and we had to wrestle him down :) Well worth the money.,positive
"I always take my son for his haircuts here. A couple of years ago, I was pretty nervous how his first-ever-haircut would go as he's a bit wild and was also a bit clingy to me when he was only 1 years old. It was EXCELLENT. The ladies at Melonhead are professionals with kids and there's lots of stuff to distract kids (i.e. great airplane/car seats, movies on tv, nice bright colours everywhere). Since then, we've always returned. My son actually asks if we can go for haircuts now! Highly recommended!",positive
"I took my son here yesterday for his first ever haircut. The space is nice and bright, lots of things around to keep the kids entertained and distracted. Unfortunately the haircut and customer service were both awful. Our ""stylist"", Veronika, took about two seconds to examine my son's long, curly hair before she started cutting. I had wanted it cleaned up but kept on the long side, what we ended up with is an awful, Dorothy Hamill type bowl cut. I told her she was taking too much length off and she didn't even pause or look up. Nor did she spend any time when she was finished to check her work to see how it looked. I was clearly unhappy with the cut, yet none of the five people behind the counter would make eye contact with us, let alone ask if we were satisfied. It was clear they didn't want to deal with the problem and wanted us out as quickly as possible. This was a disappointing experience in every way, and I am so sad when I look at my sweet son's ridiculous haircut! I wouldn't even think of going back there for a fix, that's how low the skill level was. Visit at your own risk.",negative
"This place is great for kids. We brought our son for his first haircut and it was awesome. I heard of horror stories about your child's first haircut but with the car, air plane, pony seats to entertain them he didn't say boo. The stylist cut his hair fast, she was very patient with him since he kept moving to look up at her. The haircut turned out great. We were very pleased. The staff are very nice and love children. We recommend this place if you have children, it's the place to go!",positive
"I have gotten my hair cut twice here and I am very pleased with the results! Both times I have gotten a haircut from Veronica who is very sweet and friendly and she does a fantastic job with what I want and she also gives input about what would be good whether it has to do with the type of cut, the length of the cut or what product to use afterwards. I would definitely recommend this to anyone.",positive
"This was my first time coming here as I just moved to chandler from out of state. Had a great experience. Staff is very friendly and nice to all the customers. Aimee cut my hair, she knew what she was doing and followed my instructions of what I wanted perfectly. The blade shave on the back of the neck and hot towel to follow is a great touch as well If you are looking for a new place for a hair cut this is the place to go!",positive
"I highly recommend you go see Aimee Solano here on McQeen in Gilbert...not only is she an expert hairstylist, she will make you feel like a million bucks after your neck massage, multiple hot towel treatments, and the best close shave you will ever get. Thank you Aimee for being so great at what you do!...David Sambell",positive
I've gotten my hair cut here twice so far. The customer service is phenomenal. Very clean and tidy establishment. Rachel has cut my hair on both occasions and is very professional and amicable. I'm extremely picky with my haircuts so MUGs will definitely be my permanent barbershop as long as she's there!,positive
"I have to admit I had a fantastic experience today and will recommend Men's Ultimate. Many things impressed me but what stood out is Becky's willingness to talk up everyone who works here. Made me feel very comfortable that should I need a haircut and she wasn't there, every one there does a great job. However, with that said, I will always try to book my appointment as she made the experience great. Friendly, professional, and easy to talk to. Plus, she does a great haircut. Five stars for sure.",positive
"Today,12/7/2017 I scheduled an appointment online for 10:15. This would of been the third time I would have had my hair cut at this location. I arrived at 10:00 knowing that I would have to wait from my previous two appointments. There were two customers in chairs with smocks on and only one girl cutting hair when I arrived. She did immediately greet me and said it wouldn't be long. The another girl arrived, came up front and then was to never be seen again. Now its 10:30 and between the girl cutting hair, answering the phone and texting on her personal phone that was constantly going off I knew my turn was nowhere near my appointment time. At 10:40, she finished one customer and asked me to come back another time as she tried to hand me a coupon. I refused the coupon because I will never come back again. Obviously M.U.G. has no respect for my time and has done nothing to improve their service to earn my business from the last time I was there. I am very disappointed because this location is less than a mile from my house and do believe they provide a better haircut than their close competitor Great Clips which is where I ended up going and was immediately greeted with a full staff of stylists and the same haircut. Sorry but I do believe that after three chances I have done my part to give you the opportunity to earn my business.",negative
Top notch service! I've been getting my hair cut here every two-three weeks for several months and have never had a bad cut. Becky is my go to and she always takes great care of me. Walk in appointments are accepted but I've always made appointments since it's a twenty five minute drive. Staff has been helpful with product information and they have a good selection of hair care and styling products.,positive

"Finally one in Gilbert on Val Vista/Williams Field!! This barber shop is great! Kathrynn has been cutting my hair for last 3 months and never looked better. There is also a new Brew Pub going in next door so looks like I will be getting a haircut every 2 weeks now! FINALLY a place where you can set an appointment! I had to quit Sports Clips due to long wait regardless of when you would show up. My time is valuable and I do not like 1.5 hours to get a haircut! Anyway super stylish place, great chairs and personable stylists..what is not to like??",positive
"This was the first time ever coming to MUG. The Stylist Becky took great care of me and I had No complaints, No long wait times, and they really know how to cut hair. Prices are on point with competition and a much better Atmosphere, Stylists, and Quality. Will be back, Thanks",positive
"So,it's been a bit since my last review. I've had a constant person cutting my hair Dani. It's been great no complaints for two years. Unfortunately she's no longer a constant as she has moved on to bigger and better things. I made an appointment for a haircut 9:30 and I showed up 2 minutes early. There was a walk in that came in just ahead of me and he was taken back for a hair cut I wasn't even acknowledged!!! I walked out, and will never return I headed to another shop, and I will see how it goes at least they said hi when I walked in great start! I'm giving two stars only because the person called, however 45 minutes later I guess better late than never!! Perhaps good customer service is a dying thing, but it's the most important thing when you're in the people business it's how business grows novel concept I know?!!",negative
"Decided to try this place since it is pretty close to home. I got there to find it didn't open till 9. No problem. It's only 15 minutes and there is a Dutch bros next door. 9am rolls around so I go to get my cut and the door is still locked. I see at least 1 employee inside, so I figure she is setting up and will open the door in a minute or so. Well 10 minutes go by and it's still locked up. I decided to leave when I noticed other customers showing up only to be locked out. Bad first impression MUG.",negative
"I've been going here for more than a year. The service is great and the cut is always what I want. TV's, sports, guy movies...etc...",positive
I was referred here from a few of my co workers who had been going here and had nothing but awesome feedback. I always dreaded the inconsistent haircuts I'd get from other places so I decided to give this place a try. I've been coming here since August and Elisha has done an awesome job every time cutting my hair!,positive
"Sierra was great. Good haircut and great scalp, neck, and shoulder massage. I gave it 4 stars because the website makes this place seem much different. Online it seems like it would be a men's lounge kind of feel. it's close with the big chairs and nice fixtures, but the fluorescent lights and general appearance of disorganization somewhat kills it. They have cool looking hanging lights. Would be nicer if they used them, killed the fluorescence, and organized a bit. Would be even nicer if the back office wasn't disorganized and generally open for everyone to see",positive
I was in a rush and needed to get a haircut before going out of town. I wasnt able to get an appointment at the usual salons that I've frequented for the last few years so i decided to give MUG a shot. Since my first appointment I've yet to return to the fancy salons and stylists cause the girls at MUG have their s**t on lock! Best haircut I've recieved in years and at a fraction of the cost. My biggest gripe about stylists is I never know whats gonna look best so i bring in pics of things i like and ask for advice. Most stylists had nothing for me. The girls at MUG were able to help out a lot and with my new style my girlfriend says I look like such a rugged bad ass. Needless to say ive been returning ever since. Definitely recommend.,positive
"Second time going there and each time I went there I was disappointed. This SHOP just opened up near my home and I was happy to see something similar to V's Barbershop open up near me since I use to drive about 20 minutes to get to one. Few months later, I decided to stroll in for a haircut, lady took me in - it wasn't busy at all - in fact it was empty, I told her I wanted a haircut and she went along cutting my hair which felt like something I can get at Fantastics Sams or SuperCuts. I didn't feel at it was a special ""MENS"" Grooming place at all. After my haircut, I looked at it a few times and had to correct her on uneven sides and bulk hair leftover. I mean c'mon - you want us to pay big bucks and I have to correct your hair skills? The second visit, I figured I'd give them another shot but I'm usually that guy that ""you only get one shot to prove me you're good"" but since I'm a nice guy - I thought maybe I'd just get a shave/trim. One lady in there, nobody else in there and I have to make an appointment? I mean how long does it take to get a shave/trim ?? No where in their website says anything about making appointment so what gives? You really can't spare another 20-30 minutes to do a quick shave/trim? People make appointments all the time and they still wait to get seen so even if you were 10 minutes late for your appointment it wouldn't matter you just made the company money and probably an extra tip for taking me in as a walk - in? Does this place hire dummies or what? I'm not going back here again. V's Barbershop doesn't disappoint me, never has, and they are worth far more better tips then this wannabe place.",negative
"Pretty good haircut. More of a salon vs barber shop. They only shave the back of your neck and not trim anything past there. V's gives you the whole hot towel wrap, straight razor your neck, beard and behind your ears.",negative
"I went MUG about a year ago, and had no idea it was a full service trim. I really enjoyed the staff and the cut was great. We moved away due to work but now were back! They are quite busy so the best thing to do is man an appointment. The lady that cut my hair was Jaysmn and she did a fantastic job. I would highly recommend MUG.",positive
I have been going for several months now and it's a great place for a men's cut and shave. The staff is very polite and great at what they do. My son now goes there too and teenagers are hard to please when it comes to haircuts. The best is to make an appointment as they are busy on most days for walk ins but that is a sign of a good men's barber shop.,positive
"Elisha at MUG has styled my hair for the last year. I really appreciate the ease of scheduling (always scheduling at the last minute), the relaxed atmosphere, spotless stations and low pressure attitude. I don't go to MUG to make decisions about this or that, Elisha and her team just KNOW what I want. What I want is easy, no pressure, clean, relaxed and quiet...oh yeah, and a great style and fabulous Shiatzu! The Dutch Bros next door is just an added bonus. Keep it up gang!",positive
"I went in there on a Monday morning at 9:30 without an appointment and thought they were closed. There was just one girl working there who made me wait 5 minutes because she had to get her station ready. This was my first time going there and it was excited because the girl (Heather) had a tattoo of scissors and a comb other forearm. I figured anyone who marks there body for life with scissors and a comb must know hair cutting is their calling in life and I'm in for a great haircut. Aside from asking how my day was and what I wanted done to my hair, she didn't say a word to me. No one else was in the shop and it was very awkward. I've never had my haircut by anyone who was so silent. I think I shocked her that I didn't want a buzz cut because she seemed like she didn't know what she was doing with the scissors. She acted like it was her first time cutting hair. Then when she shaved the back of my neck with the straight edge razor, she shaved little spots at a time instead of shaving one long section at a time like a barber does. I was waiting for a camera crew to come out and say this was a joke and I was on tv that's how bizarre this was. When I got home I saw that she left pieces of hair covering my ears and missed spots on the sides. Who tattoos scissors and comb on their arm if they don't know how to use them?! I felt duped and won't go back to this shop again.",negative
"This place is great, have been going for almost two years. Have seen a fair amount of turnover in women working there, but they are always excellent and always professional. I always recommend them to anyone asking about men's grooming.",positive
Mug was a great place to work but it is time for me to move on. I am now at Fantastic Sam's off the Gilbert exit on the 202. I'll miss my regular clients...good bye n God bless.,positive
"I tried this salon recently, mainly because I drive past it and it didn't look too busy. I made an appointment for the following weekend morning and was able to sit down after she finished up with one guy. Good thing I made an appointment because six other guys walked in during my time there. It was $20 for a haircut, but that included a shampoo. They offer a full line of services and seem to have a strong focus on shaving and shaving products. I did not partake in that, but maybe next time. The haircut was quick (I dont have much hair), but looked great. I will definitely use this one again.",positive
"Awesome, no-gimmick hair salon/barber for men. Menu options include scissor cut, shave cut, beard/face shave, shampoo, etc. Had my first visit yesterday and I'm impressed. Got a haircut and shampoo & was in and out in 20 minutes. Wife actually complimented my new Doo' so I guess I have a new place and stylist. Her name is Renee by the way and she kicks ass at cutting hair.",positive
"Being new to AZ, I needed to find a new stylist. I received a ""welcome to the neighborhood"" coupon for a free haircut and style with a purchase of any skin treatment. I booked a Dermaplane facial with Noelle and a haircut/style. I didn't know which stylist I was getting, but hoped to have one of their master stylist cut my hair due to it being very fine. My facial with Noelle was amazing and the results were great. My face was so smooth and my foundation went on so much better! I'll definitely keep that up as she recommended. Next was my haircut and I was happy to have Lisa as my stylist. I told her I was possibly looking to go shorter but wasn't committed yet. She recommended a bob for now and if I decide to go shorter, it's something I can always do later. Lisa did a great job and even recommended an idea for color which I'm doing at my next appointment. Front desk staff were also great, attentive and helpful!",positive
"First time, last time customer here. I paid 190 to the salon and 20 in tip to my stylist. Not even sure what I ended up with actually. I was roped into at least 60 bucks worth of ""conditioning or gloss or whatever"". I wont drag my stylist but what gets me if her mission was to make my current set up ""easier to maintain"" why did it cost so much? I have never in my life paid over 200 for a cramped setting like that. And the stylist knew their prices are ridiculous because she even said, ""you can just get a touch-up next time"". Like who wants to get a fraction of their hair done? Overall, the prices are insane for the setting. I will head back to Scottsdale. I am getting my entire head highlighted/low lighted cut and styled for that price. I cant stand the partial work, its ghetto. And I refuse to line the pockets of salon owners that wanna cramp people in all awkward like.",negative
I had a bad haircut that needed some help. I read the reviews of JJ and decided to give her a try. She looked the situation over and started cutting. I love it! She is very skilled and listened to what I had in mind. I'll definitely be back when it's time for my next cut.,positive
"I was referred by a friend to Karinna at Michael Alexander Salon. I have long black hair that was previously bleached twice to try and get a purple color (to no avail-it ended up red or pink). Karinna was attentive to my needs and seemed to really care about the condition that my hair ended up in. She was excited to see the end result especially when my hair took the lightening way better than she hoped. My hair ended up a beautiful, bright violet (which she mixed with a bit of pink to even out the blue tones in it-so smart!) ombre and I love it! One issue I had was that Karinna offered to trim the dead ends off of my hair, to which I agreed to a 2 inch trim. I didn't realize that she was not going to preserve the layering in my hair and basically chopped off 2 inches and made my hair end very bluntly all at the same length. I didn't realize this until later when the curls she gave me started to loosen. When I called her about it she was gracious and offered to add in those layers for me at no extra charge (+tip of course!). She squeezed me in on a busy Saturday and even though she had to reschedule me at the last minute I still appreciated her working me in as a free appointment. She fixed the layers to a satisfactory level and made me a happy customer! My advice-Karinna is amazing at coloring so definitely go to her for that! In terms of cut, just make sure you are communicative about your wants and needs. Otherwise it may not turn out the way you want (not that it was Karinna's fault or anything-I never said anything about the layers so that's on me. I just asssumed she would keep them). But if you aren't happy with your hair she'll definitely make it right. As a reference, I paid $170 + tip for my bleaching and coloring. Thanks Karinna!",positive
"Best haircuts I have ever had. In my 40 years of getting haircuts, the ones I get here are the best. Normally a haircut is a haircut, but not here. You get a better cut. I use JJ, but I think they are all top shelf.",positive
JJ does my haircuts and Brazilian Treatments and she is the absolute best! I have been going to her for 9 years and I always get compliments on my hair cut. The salon is upbeat and friendly. I highly recommend Michael Alexander Salon.,positive
"CFF Clean Fast Friendly.This was my first visit to Micheal Alexander,wooooow Korrina T she did my hair i love it,thanks Korrina T for the best customer service,I am so happy that I decided to do my hair here,i will recommended to everyone.Absolutely 5 stars.",positive
"I went in on an ""Our Town"" coupon and got to sit in Julie (JJ's) chair. She did a great job with what I was looking for. The cut and style came out the way that I was expecting and she didn't bs me in telling me that she could give me the look I wanted when I knew I had some issues with my ends in the first place. I will definitely be coming back.",positive
"Wonderful place and amazing service. Beth did an excellent job on my eyelashes with the extension. She is also kind and friendly and listens to you. Everybody who works at the salon is professional and helpful. I'm so glad to find them, and I can't wait to go back to do the filling on my eyelashes. Thank you everybody for the kindness and care. Thank you Beth for making my eyes beautiful.",positive
It took me 6 years of bad highlights and underwhelming haircuts to find Beth at Michelle Alexander. She's a skilled artist with a ton of technical color experience including my favorite- balayage. I love that she has fresh ideas and is always ahead of the trends.,positive
One of the best salons I have ever been too. Awesome services. Very flexible schedules and hours. Very upscale for awesome prices. By far one of my favorite salons.,positive
Amazing amazing service!!! If your looking for a clean friendly experienced salon go here! The nail tech does an amazing job! I have gotten my eye lash extensions done here by Dana and they are amazing! Never been so pleased! Beth has been doing my hair and I love my ombré she does!!! Love love the services here they make me feel like family! Book your appt today!! :-),positive
"I decided to give this salon a go, but in the end I just wish I had gone another way. The Salon is small, but clean and the receptionist was very friendly. She correctly guessed who I was based on the time I walked in and the appointment that was scheduled which was nice, she let me know that she would inform my stylist that I was there. I sat myself down and not another word was said to me or another glance given for the next 20 minutes. I wasn't too upset about the wait time because I did arrive 15 minutes early. However, no offer of a magazine to read, water to drink, or coffee, etc. Eye contact seemed to be avoided at all costs. To be fair, there was some self serve coffee set out if I had wanted any, but I didn't. It was cool to me because I'm not much for eating and drinking while I get my hair done to begin with, but if you're going to try to be competitive with other high end salons in the valley (of which there are many), you're going to have to do far better than some 'serve yourself' gas station style coffee setup on the side. After 20 minutes of waiting my stylist came out and so it began. I felt that I was very clear in the style of cut that I wanted, even going so far as to show pictures of what I wanted, and then we discussed color. Then.. the cutting started.... Now, I went in for a pretty classic cut, something in the style of an A-Line, where I could tuck it to the side if I wanted. This should be a simple haircut for even the novice stylist. I don't know why I bothered to say anything in the first place - it was a cut that I could have gotten at Great Clips, if even that good. While all of this was going on, the entire staff seemed disinterested in being there at best. Most of them were doing 1 of 3 things, 1) Checking their cellphones and texting constantly, 2) Bitching about the atmosphere and the music there - I guess station changes are not allowed? or 3) Cleaning / sweeping or doing menial chores with scowls on their faces. Biting my tongue since it was already far too late in the process, I hoped that the whole bad cut would be redeemed in the color / styling portion of the experience. What I got for the color was even more shockingly bad than the damned cut itself! As many of you know, hair dye tends to DYE the skin it touches. By the time the stylist was finished slopping the dye on (and I don't use that term lightly), I had dye all over my forehead, ears, neck and face. Even worse, she didn't offer to wipe it off of my face at ALL!!! I shit you not - she dabbed around my ears, scrubbed around the hairline, and didn't even touch the dye that she smeared across my face that was visibly darkening!! Even then she still didn't wipe it off but tried to brush the side of the hair over it to cover it! To add insult to injury, the entire botched job ended up costing me FAR more for JUST the cut and color / highlights than what I have paid at previous high end salons. No product after that - why bother? I have gone to Dolce Salon, Mane Attraction Salon and various other Salons across the Valley over the years. Any ONE of them had far superior service, far superior staff, far superior environment, and far superior quality - PLUS I could get product to go with the new cut and style for less than what I paid to walk out of here for. Long story short? I walked out looking Shemp from the 3 Stooges with a black eye thanks to the dye smeared across my face. I did manage to scrub the dye off at home. My boyfriend ended up trimming the back in places she had 'missed'. Yeah.. awesome. And while the stylist was nice and friendly, I will not be going back there. Buyer beware.",negative
"I have been going to JJ at this salon for about a year since being on a search for a full service stylist (that I'm happy with) in the Phoenix area. JJ does a great cut, color and highlights and I receive multiple compliments from strangers regarding my color. The salon is run very efficiently-the receptionist always addresses me by name upon arrival, lets my stylist know I've arrived and immediately offers me a drink. I observe the work of other stylists when I'm there and find that every person who leaves the chair looks polished and happy with their hair. They also offer nail and skin care services although I haven't had personal experience with those, therefore can't comment on them. I'd compare it to any high end salon in the Phoenix/Scottsdale area. If you are looking for an excellent full service salon and you are within a 30 minute drive, this salon is worth checking out. They are right off I-17 and easy to get to. You won't be sorry.",positive
"I love the nail techs at Michael Alexander salon. I've been going to Kellie for years now and she is amazing! Nicole also does fabulous nails so you can't lose! Trust me, I'm very particular about my acrylic nails. The hair stylists all know me by name and are very friendly. It's a welcoming environment and everyone is friendly and helpful. I highly recommend this salon.",positive
"Their staff is extremely professional, fun and talented! I have used them for numerous occasions on top of my normal routine and they always come through and make me feel beautiful! I love the lash extensions that Tina does, Kellie does amazing nails and Cindy Maxwell does my hair color and brazillian blowout. Love them all!",positive
"I've been searching for a stylist since my usual stylist left almost a year ago from Anthem. I called in and got scheduled in with Lisa the same day. Lisa is great - not only did she fix some nasty ""oops"" cutting issues with my trying to find a person to do my hair, but she also redid my highlights so they look amazing. She does an awesome job and my highlights don't fade out to the straw-color they were notorious for fading too. I have found my stylist!",positive
"Today was my second experience with this salon and it was probably the worst customer service I have experienced in a salon, ever. I am not even going to go into all of it, but the worst of it was that the receptionist had to shampoo me and blow-dry my hair while the stylist fit in her friend. The stylist never even came to check how the color turned out. I left with damp, unstyled hair, needing toner and a cut (which I was scheduled for). I am just so surprised. I better find a new salon to fix this fast! Hello, this is AZ, there are tons of awesome salons! Do yourself a favor and skip this place - they won't care anyways.",negative
"Love Love Love this salon. Immediately when you walk into the door, you feel like you have known these people for a long time. They seem like all close friends. Good environment to relax and get your hair, makeup or nails done! (And don't forget the skin care they do here too). I will never go to another salon to get my hair cut/colored. They all do a fantastic job! I always walk out of there feeling like a million bucks but I'm not paying a fortune! Also, just recently, I had my entire wedding party get their makeup and hair done for my wedding there. We all got in to each stylist around the same time, so it was really quick. And my gosh, everyone looked amazing! And the makeup looks stunning. Not to mention the false eyelashes we all got. Very classy (super surprised too b/c it was my first time with fake eyelashes on). I live in Phoenix but will make the trip up to Anthem just for the service and quality!",positive
"Best blow dry ever! Michael knows colour, cut, extensions, styling and most importantly does the best blow dry in Scottsdale. I can never make my hair look even close. He will be honest and if you want to do something different with your hair, he will tell you if your type of hair will do that. With over 30 years experience he is not a young kid fresh out of beauty school that hopes for the best. He knows his stuff and obviously is the owner of the salon. Yes, the location is a prime spot in Old Town (right next to Teres) but is just a little cheaper in pricing than other salons. His salon is definitely a nicer business but he keeps it casual where it is not a snobby atmosphere. He does have a big clientele. If you need your hair done within the week he can typically fit you in. Call the business line. He usually is the person who answers and set an appointment. Guarantee if your loyalty is up for grabs then you should go to Michael V Salon and see what you think.",positive
"Kimberly is amazing! I am very picky wth my hair and normally wait till I go home to SD to get my hair done! But I was desperate for a trim and my hair needed some help bad! I have long balayaged/ombré hair. After doing some research, I decided to try Kimberly! She exceeded my expectations! I went in for a deep conditioning and haircut and it turned out so great! She listened to exactly what I wanted and cut my layers so well that it looked like I recolored my hair! The deep conditioning treatment was amazing...it made my hair feel and look like silk. The next day at work, I received sooo many compliments on how great my hair looked! So much so that my coworker ended up booking with Kimberly that same day for the following week! Finding the right hairstylist is tough, but I'm so thankful to have found Kimberly! Thanks so much, Kimberly! I will definitely be back!",positive
"I arrived in Scottsdale a couple of weeks ago for a business project. I'm from Los Angeles and I am VERY picky when it comes to my hair style (cut and color). I happened to notice a woman in line at a local store and asked her where she got her AMAZING hair cut? She said Michael V Salon and be sure to ask for Michael. Two days later I am sitting in Michael's chair at his salon. He provided a thorough consultation (reviewing my hair texture, current style, color, cut etc). Michael wanted to know what was working and wasn't including the products I used. By the way, he did NOT attempt to sell me any new products -- he thought what I was using was great (L'Oreal Kerastase line). I was beyond happy with the outcome. Truly my hair has NEVER looked so FANTASTIC! The haircut was done with full concentration and precision as was my hair color. He works with one client at a time and doesn't walk away until he has completed the service and you are happy. I HIGHLY recommend Michael and the Michael V Salon!!! Elizabeth S. Los Angeles, CA",positive
"KIMBERLY IS AMAZING!!! Not only is she well priced, she does an amazing job and gives suggestions on super affordable hair products! 10/10. Highly recommend Kimberly!",positive
"I miss getting my hair cut and highlighted by Michael! :( I had to move to the po-dunk backwards city of San Antonio two years ago and haven't been able to find anyone as good. More expensive-yes, but no where near the expertise, class and honesty of Michael. I'm writing this review because I just had a rotten experience here in San Antonio and decided if I was going to give them a review, I should give Michael one too! I hope to travel back to Scottsdale in January next year and am absolutely planning to make an appointment!",positive
"Kim is the worst. Super dishonest, doesn't do work well. Great salon, nice looking. But worst hair experience i have ever had.",negative
I've been going to Michael V.'s for over 17 years. Michael could probably give you the best cut & color with his eyes close. Worth every penny.,positive
"First visit to this salon was awesome!! My family and I have been going to Elizabeth for over three years now and every time has been a great experience. My son and wife see Elizabeth more often than I do...as you can tell from my pics...I have no hair! My wife is extremely picky and trendy and Elizabeth has been dedicated to keeping her (hair) happy. Elizabeth's prices for Color, Cuts and Brazilian Blowouts are more than reasonable and every month she sends us texts with promotions!! Elizabeth has been our family stylist for years but she has also become part of our family. If you're looking for a new stylist...someone who cares about how you look and not just how much money you put in her purse...check her out!!! Contact Elizabeth directly @ 623-234-0471 (yes, I asked her permission before blasting her # over Yelp!)",positive
"Elizabeth is an outstanding stylist! I came to her with orange hair, because my last dye job was horrendous and I attempted to fix it myself. I walked into the salon and she was the only stylist there and with a client. I was in tears. I only waited a moment before Elizabeth acknowledged me. She was kind, knowledgeable, professional and available to help me the following day. Its rare to find a hair stylist in Old Town Scottsdale that care as much as the stylists do in this salon. Color correction, cuts, Brazilian Blowouts, you name it, this lady does it! And it didn't cost me my first born either! Scottsdale precision and perfection without the Scottsdale cost. This salon has a cool unpretentious vibe as well...Its worth checking out!!",positive
"I went for the first time last month for a cut and highlights. Michael was very good at understanding what I wanted and most importantly, GAVE ME WHAT I WANTED! I paid just a little less than what I had been paying so I think I'll go back since I'm on a tighter budget these days like most of us ;) Hopefully he can keep his prices reasonable. I really don't get these stylists that charge like they're using real gold in your hair instead of $4 bleach products.",positive
"I have been going to Michael for at least a year now, and am a pretty satisfied customer. 1) great location at the corner of Indian School and Scottsdale Rd. 2) totally chill vibe for the primo location! Michael owns the salon and keeps the feel very grounded -- not pretentious or snooty at ALL. 3) great value: very reasonable prices for cut and color 4) flexible scheduling. The one heads up I must give is that Michael will DEFINITELY want to talk with you while you're there, so don't plan on any spaced out zen time. If you're reading a magazine, he'll be right over your shoulder asking what you are reading about. On the plus side, he is super intelligent and outspoken so it's fun to talk about politics or local issues with him -- he's very well rounded and has had a super interesting life.",positive
"A co-worker came in with a dope haircut, prompting me to ask where she got it. Cut to me having a minute off, and time to make the appointment. The owner and head stylist, Kelley, had the last appointment free in 90 minutes, so come on by. Excellent. It's a little shop tucked across from the Giant Eagle (don't park in their lot!), with a comfy waiting area. Kelley called me over for the consult and just got it immediately. Not only that but she was enthusiastically on board with what I wanted. I had had a bad cut from a different salon previously and told her all the ways I didn't want to hold onto that shape, as well as what I did want. An hour later my hair was all over the floor in a ring of the fallen, and my hair looked AMAZING. All the texture and layers and movement I missed was there again. Seriously a great haircut. And she even passed on her car mechanic's info (contextually - I needed on and she was talking about it). Really aces.",positive

"I've had probably a dozen cuts at Mint by Kelsey. My hair is fine and straight and a good cut makes all the difference. Kelsey has given me a truly great cut every time. When I was ready to change styles, she helped me decide what would work for me, taking into consideration my hair type, time I was willing to spend on it (not much), what would be most flattering--and she hit it out of the park right away. She's also fun to talk to and a kind soul.",positive
"I've been getting my hair cut here by Kelsey. She does a great job every time. She listens to what I want, and gives helpful suggestions. I'm always happy with my cut, and it grows out beautifully in between. The salon itself is a cool space. Highly recommend!",positive
"Kelsey just gave me the best haircut of my life! I'm obsessed with my new hair, and I'm someone who usually doesn't care about my hair. I can go months and months without getting a cut and style. Kelsey is crazy talented, professional, courteous, and super nice too. I just moved to Pittsburgh from the Bay Area, CA and already found my new amazing stylist. Thanks Kelsey see you for my next cut!",positive
"I have been going to Mint for a few months now, and have been extremely pleased with everything about it. Kelley is my stylist, and she does both my hair and my daughter's hair. First off, she really listens to what you want to do, and gives suggestions and ideas based on the look you are going for. I've left the salon thrilled each time she has done my hair. And my daughter, who goes for the crazy, trendy colors, loves her look each time as well. And, Kelley does one of the best wavy blow-outs that I have ever had. The last one I had lasted from Saturday until Thursday in hot, humid weather...and she doesn't charge extra for it either. Kelley is also personable and funny, and makes the experience of sitting for a bit with color on your hair entertaining and fun. It also seems like what I pay for my services is really reasonable. I've gone to salons before where I have walked out after getting the same services with a much larger bill at the end.",positive
"I just had my haircut by Kelsey. I am a very very haircutting anxious Customer to put it gently, and I had not had my haircut in over a year because of a bad haircut experience previously. Kelsey took 6 inches off of my overgrown haircut, called me down off the ledge of doing my layers, and gave me an amazing haircut and took so much extra time to help me understand what was happening with my hair, and did an amazing amazing job. I can't recommend her highly enough. And this is coming from someone who is willing to pay $50 to get my haircut, and it was not $50 here, actually was inexpensive considering high-end haircuts. I had just heard about the salon from a total stranger who's haircut I just happen to like, got a same day appointment, and it is one of the best haircuts I've ever had. I can't say enough good things about it.",positive
"Mint is such a little gem! Kelley & her team are just lovely and fun. I've had my hair cut & dyed at Mint quite a few times and have been thrilled with my hair every time. It's not easy to find a good salon for cut & color work, but I'm so happy that I was referred to Mint by a friend of a friend. Beautiful, precision cuts + the decor is cool & fun. It just feels like an awesome, cozy and special place. In short, Mint rocks!",positive
"I needed a haircut badly, and figured a stylist in training couldn't go too wrong with it. Not only was Kelsey friendly and professional, but I got one of the best haircuts I've ever had for $5. This is definitely my new go-to place.",positive
"Kelley is amazing. I have been with Kelley for a good five or six years now and I don't think I could go to another stylist. She is an awesome colorist, and I always leave the salon feeling and looking great. Highly recommended.",positive
"Fantastic first experience at Mint Salon! I am more than impressed with Kelsey, their newest stylist. She had a great personality; very upbeat and friendly. Since she has not had a lot of experience, the process did take longer than usual, but it was well worth the wait! She has great attention to detail and made sure no hair was out of place before I walked out of that salon. Not only do they provide excellent service, it came at an amazing deal: $15 to shampoo, cut, and dry my hair (promotion for Kelsey to build experience). Thanks for taking good care of me today! This is definitely my new go-to salon in Pittsburgh!",positive
"VERY UNPROFESSIONAL SALON AND NO CUSTOMER SERVICE. I arrived a half hour early for my hair appointment and waited in my car down the street. I was Kelley's first appointment and when I tried to open the door it was locked only to find out the salon had moved. They never bothered to inform me of this or send me a flyer or email. I frantically tried to call two times in a row only to get their answering machine. ""When I did hear back from them I hurried to get to the new location. The girl said if it was anything after 15 minutes she would have to reschedule me. I proceeded to tell her I am within 5 minutes of their new location but she said it is too late. I told her I am late because nobody bothered to tell me they moved since my last appointment. She was very cold and uncaring that I had driven an hour away (from Westmoreland County). I asked to speak to the owner Kelley but she refused to let me talk to her. She said she was busy. How could she be busy when I was her first appointment? It was obvious to me the owner and the rest of the staff could care less about their customers. I have never been late for an appointment because I always pride myself to be early. After further conversation with my friends we will not be back.",negative
"I've been going to see Kelley for about 7 years now, well before she opened Mint. I've had a wide variety of hair styles over that span of time, from long to a bob to a pixie and back again (and in various colors,) and Kelley has nailed it every single time. Her staff is courteous, professional, and very friendly. I have and will continue to recommend her to people looking for a new stylist.",positive
I've been to mint for a cut twice now and I love it. I have thick curly/wavy hair that does whatever it wants. My first visit to mint was the first haircut I had since I moved to Pittsburgh and I was ready for a big chop. I was nervous and Danielle put me right at ease. 12 inches gone! It felt great. Then she washed and cut my hair. I never felt better. My new short hair was exactly what I wanted. My second visit I requested Danielle again and wanted to really give my new short hair a style and some lift. Danielle listened and made my hair look better than I thought possible! I love mint and will continue to schedule appointments there!,positive
"I loved my experience at Mint with Danielle! I'm new to Pittsburgh and wanted to find an affordable but good salon in Shadyside. Danielle listened to what I wanted and executed it perfectly! The salon was clean, the atmosphere relaxing. I recommend anyone and everyone to book an appointment with Kelly or Danielle. I'll be back!",positive
Kelly is amazing. I have a lot of curly hair and she is a magician with it. I always come out of the salon feeling like a rockstar.,positive
This place is insanely good. Jennifer is such a great stylist. She did my hair cut and suggested some highlight and the result was more than amazing. I've received so much compliments for my new hair cut and I can't recommend this salon more,positive
"Kelley-the owner-has been my stylist for years. I was so happy and excited when she opened her own salon because I knew that not only would she employ the best stylists, but that her place would look amazing! The salon is super unique-my favorite part is that they have a rotating art gallery with an opening every few months with food and wine! Back to the hair-Kelley always knows exactly what color to pick and I always love it. Sometimes I come in wanting a little change but not sure what, and I have always left extremely happy with what she does. I actually live in LA now and no other stylist can come close. Whenever I come back to Pittsburgh, Mint Salon and Gallery is my first stop!",positive
"Got a trim on Christmas Eve. Called upfront around 10 AM and was connected immediately. Daniel was very detailed and worked with my hair with great patience (I have very thick hair). I asked if I could keep the current length and thin out, and after the shampoo, cut (trim) and drying, she patiently worked on thinning out my hair. I thought all the questions she asked me were precise (where I wanted to part my hair, if I wanted to keep the length of my bang which was longer than the rest, etc.) and I'm happy with the outcome. This is my second haircut in the US... My first experience at a ""high-end"" salon was not good so I wasn't expecting to be satisfied, but such a pleasant surprise! Also, the conversation throughout was warm and pleasant. I'm the one who likes to watch the process instead of talking, plus the language difficulty as being a foreigner, doubles up making me more silent, but I enjoyed the conversation. Unfortunately, I'm not too happy with the shampoo (no capes or towels put on to avoid getting wet) therefore the 4 stars. (Maybe this is something I will be facing anywhere and everywhere.) The artworks on the wall are giving a nice unique taste.",positive
"I've been a client of Kelley's for about 10 years now. This salon really embodies what can describe Kelley as a stylist - fresh, unique and modern. I always have a hard time figuring out what I want to do with my hair. I love that Kelley gives me imput and really takes her time to make sure I'm getting exactly what I want ( even when I don't know what that is). You can really tell that this is her passion. She always picks the perfect color for me. And when I'm ready for a change, she always has something even more perfect already in mind. And the color really stays! I have to wash my hair every day & I can go six weeks with no problem! The other thing that makes me love this place even more is the rest of the staff. Everyone is so welcoming that you really feel like you're in a room with a bunch of friends. The energy in this place is just infectious! You can really tell when people truly enjoy working with each other, which makes for a comfortable, enjoyable & pleasant experience. And did I mention there's wine??",positive
"Look no further. You've just found your new go-to, #1, favorite salon! Mint has a hip, modern, comfortable, relaxed, fresh feel. You'll feel welcome as soon as u step foot in the door by the warm and friendly staff. My mom and I go every couple weeks. She loves the way Kelley styles her. She's never been able to find someone to style her hair exactly how she describes! She leaves with exactly what she wanted every time! Kelley is a professional, seasoned stylist blessed with a gift of making her clients look good!",positive
"If you have asian hair, go here. Brandy has really good scissor technique which is great for getting texture on what is considered difficult hair. She is leaps and bounds better than others in pittsburgh (or california or boston for that matter)",positive
"Love this salon and the stylists that work there. I live in Greensburg, Pa with plenty of hair salons around, but make the 45 min drive every few weeks to see Dani. She is extremely knowledgeable about color and is more then willing to try something new. If you are looking for a fresh look stop into Mint salon and ask for Dani! She won't disappoint!",positive
"I highly recommend Mint Salon & Gallery and Kelley specifically. She has been cutting my hair for about 8 years, and I have followed her to several salons. I have a bit of a complicated haircut, and she always does it perfectly. You will also love the decor of the salon, with vintage pieces and rotating art on the walls for purchase. Plus, you can enjoy a glass of wine or other beverage before your haircut. How many salons offer that?!",positive
"I love Mint Salon. You will not walk out disappointed. .The girls do a great job of keeping their clients looking modern, fresh, and hip. Fun atmosphere. Kelly is an artist...The only person who has ever given me a killer cute short haircut...goes into place almost on its own due to the precision of the cut....and she does a fab job on my b f's hair..guys trust me it's worth a few more bucks than a mall haircut, you can see the difference.",positive
"Dante Salon changed owners a few months ago and is now called Mint Salon. The new owner, Kelly, clearly has no customer service skills nor any regard for the satisfaction of her clients. I suspect she will be out of business very, very soon. I'm about to write a novel, but the summary is that there are plenty of other good salons in the area and Dante/Mint does NOT deserve your business!! Danielle is the one who attempted to color my hair. She failed miserably. I went in to see if I could get a color consultation appointment and I talked to Danielle about doing on ombre on my slightly-longer-than-shoulder-length hair. I know that ombre is typically done on darker, longer, more layered hair, but I have seen it look really nice on hair similar to mine. I have never had my hair colored before, so I asked lots of questions to make sure I was going to get exactly what I wanted. I explained to her why I wanted an ombre: I wanted some sort of color change, but don't want it to grow out noticeably, and ombre is just color on the ends of the hair, which is perfect. Danielle said that she just learned a new technique to ombre hair in a more subtle way, and we agreed that sounded like a good idea because of my hair length and color. I ended up with a weird mixture of chunky and stringy highlights that didn't quite touch my roots. It looked awful. Absolutely not an ombre by ANY means. But, since I'd never had my hair colored before, it took me a day or so to realize how botched it was. I called them and explained that I don't think I got what I asked for, and if I could come back in to have them fix it. The receptionist was really polite and sweet and told me to come back in and they would take care of it. Round two, I should not have trusted Danielle again. She put a color lifter on my ends and called it a day, only after charging me for the product and a crooked trim. It looked even worse. Again, I should have realized before I left, but I felt like I was under a lot of pressure. Danielle and Kelly consulted with each other within my earshot about how they -did- give me an ombre, and just in general made me feel like I was being a huge problem for them. I made sure to be extra polite but it didn't seem to matter. I ended up going to Nadia Salon on Walnut Street where Lee saved my hair. However, the damage that Danielle did was so extensive that he had to cut off a bunch of dead ends, fix the crooked trim, and apply color to my roots to cover the highlights--- all of these things could have been avoided if only Danielle had actually given me the hair I asked for, instead of defending herself and using me as a guinea pig for this so called ""new technique"". I went back to Mint/Dante and (politely, again) asked to speak with the owner. She was with a client, so I asked her if she would have time to speak with me today at all. She flat out said ""nope""! I understand that she was busy but that was so rude. It's a small place (same 4 stylists each time I was there) so I am positive she recognized me. Danielle was at the front desk and I told her that even though I came back to have my hair fixed, I am still not happy with it, and would like to know if I could get some sort of refund. She gave me Kelly's card and said I could email her. (I brought my boyfriend with me so that I wouldn't back down) He politely said that I have already spent a lot of time/money here, and I don't want emailing her to be another big ordeal. We were there to clear the air and talk with the owner before writing a bad review somewhere. Danielle said Kelly would be able to talk with us in 15 minutes. We waited 25 minutes while listening to them talk about how my hair looks worse now (it doesn't). After that, I left my email and told Kelly she could contact me to work something out. Then I got the f*** out of there. I'm sure other stylists there have done good work, and normally I would say that the stylist does not represent the whole of the salon, but Kelly was unbelievably rude. She is the owner of the salon and therefore she must own up to the work of her stylists. I would be willing to edit this review if she contacted me for a refund, but it really doesn't seem like that's her style. Please, please don't give them your money. Picture of my hair after the first visit: i.imgur.com/E853WIg.jpg i.imgur.com/2Z10s4Z.jpg That's supposed to be an ombre.. After she ""fixed it"": i.imgur.com/PMJL5KA.jpg i.imgur.com/G81QvMX.jpg",negative
"I made an appointment with a stylist, and she gave me a cute hair cut. I like the change of hair style so I'm giving a positive comment. The stylist is very careful. Besides, the location of the salon is really good. Bus could get there. People are nice.",positive
I lived in Los Angeles and have gone to many salons in Beverly Hills and paid top dollar. I was looking for something like that. I went here and let me say I am so happy about my hair!! I wanted a completely new look with bangs. I was very scared getting this done with a new hairdresser. But wow!! I am so happy with my hair! It looks exactly like the picture I brought in!! Haley was my hairdresser. She is down to earth and very nice!! I am defiantly going to be her regular!! This place has a great price!!!! Very affordable!! My hair looks better then what I paid in LA and I got it way cheaper!! I wish I could've tipped more!! I defiantly recommend coming here!!! And Haley is the best!!,positive
"I just got back from an appointment with Haley, and I am extremely happy with my cut! I've been wanting to get bangs for a while now and finally decided to, still with some hesitation. Haley was extremely helpful in helping me decide how to get them cut and suggesting what would look best. She also made sure to ask me as she was going if I liked how they looked. The rest of the cut looks amazing as well, I couldn't be happier! Plus, as a poor college student, the price for a cut with her is very reasonable.",positive
"My fiance and I moved to Pittsburgh in June. As every lady knows, finding a new stylist can be daunting. I initially just got a haircut to see if I felt comfortable at Dante, which Haley executed perfectly. A couple months later, my hair still looked great, but I figured I'd give color a try there as well. Brandy asked just the right questions to get me the effect I was going for. I got partial foil highlights, a cut, and a blowout. Their prices are extremely reasonable for the attention to detail you get at this salon. They have very high quality products as well, which left my hair smelling and looking great even the next day. Even the front desk is extremely friendly and helpful. Thanks Dante Salon, for making a girl feel at home!",positive
This lady sophia use to own Laguna day spa on eastern. She is a horrible person. She messed up my eyebrows. I cried after I left. I looked all overthe internet for a solution. I found another woman at a different place to remove. Sophia was rude she wouldn't give my money back. I went back and she was so crazy called the cops on me. I had my two children with me. She is horrible.,negative
"I was bribed with my refund to delete my review. I read on the yelp website that it is illegal to bribe to alter or delete my review. So here it goes, I first found Sophia from Groupon. I called other businesses, but she was the first to get back to me. I was planning Mother's Day and I didn't realize I should really look into her work and herself as a business. I didn't think much of it, because she was located inside of Canyon Falls Spa and Salon, where i have previously had hair extensions done and was an awesome job. I arrived at Canyon Falls, and Sophia was sleeping in her room. The receptionist texted and had to continuously call her and woke her up. I should have left and went with my gut feeling, since i had my 3 year-old with me. I showed her pictures of what i wanted. She rushed me through explaining it and kept saying yeah yeah i make it look good. And drew outlines, didn't measure and reassured they would be even and smaller than the outlines. Since this is her profession and i have had my eyebrows done twice before and came out wonderful, i thought she knew what she doing. 3 1/2 hours later, a mistake that i will live with constantly every day looking into the mirror at myself has been made. They weren't even at all. Not the shape i had requested. I decided to treat myself for mothers day, am now emotionally and physically scarred. I will let you be the judge. This isn't like a bad hair cut, this is my face! PERMANENT makeup on my face. I called her an hour later and Sophia told me that she will fix her mistake and i have to do a retouch $50 in a few weeks. I then went to 3 different estiticians and Dr. Smith, they all had the same terrible news: SHE MESSED UP MY FACE and they were in disbelief she was liscenced. She refused to give me a refund and hung up on me when i let her know the situation. A MONTH LATER, she called me and asked me to bring my laptop and meet her at BJ's Bar and she will bring a money order. I asked her to bring cash instead. I lost trust in her from everything that has happened. She then met me. 2 hours it took, to get my refund back. I had to get the bartender involved and be the mediator. Anyway, i decided to write this, in hopes to save other fellow women of making one of the biggest mistakes of their lives.",negative
I suggest anyone who is looking for permanent makeup or microblading do their research first. Sophia has been from salon to salon. With 1 star reviews at each place. Look at Laguna Spa.,negative
This is my first time microblading! My eyebrows came out better than I expected. I was there for a couple hours with Sophia. She took her time with me until they were perfect. She went over which style I wanted and everything. I would definitely recommend her anytime.,positive
"NO stars If I could! This woman Sophia ruined my eyebrows!!!!!!!!!! I have cried for days and I have went to consultations all over in hopes to find someone fixing Sophias HUGE mistakes. I'm truly traumatized and will NEVER, EVER let anyone touch my face again thanks to her. I am filing a formal complaint with the cosmetology licensing board bc I don't want someone else's precious brows get destroyed or ruined.. :( thanks to her she ruined natural shapes and plucked one side of eye brows to point where I have no hair ! She also said not one person will get microblading done right first time on customers and customers always have to come back for it to look perfect. Really? Bc alot of my friends have had microblading and done RIGHT FIRST TIME !!!. She basically gave me a hard time to give me my money back and kept saying she'll fix it. Sorry no I won't allow her to make even more and bigger mistakes thn she already did first time. Finally she got it in her head that I just wanted my money back and be done!!!",negative
"I went here last Friday for a quick polish change. I was able to get a seat right away because the rest of the world was at happy hour. Lassime, (wrong spelling?) my nail tech was super sweet and VERY precise with her work. I spent most of my time chatting and laughing with Tim and the rest of the team. The shop offers a lot of services so it can be a one stop shop. Overall, I had a nice experience and would recommend a friend to go here if you're in need of a last minute primping. P.S. they're open until 8!!!!!",positive
"Small hole in the wall (literally), not so clean, grungy, cheap nail salon. I tried this place 3 times because although my nails always sucked and broke EVERY time, the staff is really friendly and nice. I give up on this place because I'm sick of going in every 5 days for them to fix a broken nail or a nail that astonishingly just pops off. The purpose of paying for nails is to have pretty hands and flaunt them, but I always found myself hiding my nails because they always looked so bad :( every other place I go, I can always last 3 weeks without a fill and I never get broken nails! At this place, I got broken nails on the reg. I would have acrylic glopped on the sides and onto my nails, uneven nails, and smudgy polish. Horrible! The inside is not nice, they need to remodel and invest in some better nail products. I would never recommend this place.",negative
"I was not impressed with this place. I called because I wanted a last minute manicure and it was close by. The woman on the phone quoted me their special price of $25 for a gel manicure. The man doing my nails was nice, but it was weirdly quiet in there. No music or anything. I had a glitter overcoat on my nails and, while I appreciate that he was trying to get a lot of glitter on my nails, it turned out lumpy. He had to fix two nails and there was another lump I didn't bother asking him to fix. And the Polish is off the nail on a few fingers... When I went to pay, he said it was $35, not $25! When I said what I had been quoted he said that was fine. But, even though it said they take card, he asked me to go to the grocery store next door and get cash out. Which required me to buy something. Then they only have multiples of $10, so I paid him $30 (after I had already tipped him) and he didn't offer to give me change. I don't think I will be going to this place again.... I ended up paying as much as I would have at a higher end place anyways.",negative
"This place is NOT closed! As of July 8th, 2013 they are open! Mindy did my nails - they took a long time, but she did lots of detail and charged me a more than reasonable amount. She and Tim the Nail Man are definitely the go-to people there. Definitely recommend. Suggest any design - they can do it!",positive
"The good reviews surprise me...honestly. I popped in here because it's nearby my house and it's open late. I typically go to Pink Polish and eventually I'll learn to just KEEP going there! I had ""Tim the Nail Man"" as he calls himself. He was friendly enough and open to my design suggestions which is HUGE in my book. Hence, two stars. The only thing I didn't like as far as a nail tech goes was that he didn't wipe the shellac away from the edges of my nail. Once it hardened it actually went a little onto my skin which is weird and somewhat uncomfortable. As I said, the designs were cute - I told him what I wanted nail by nail and he was happy to do whatever I suggested. =) It's in the dark corner right by pranksters and a second hand store. I wouldn't personally call it cozy myself. The inside was not well-kept. There were a few gnats over by the pedi station so I just skipped that option all together. And while I was getting my nails done there was an ant on the towel under my hands. He brushed it away.....thank you? So, the two upsides. 1) The nail designs I requested turned out well. 2) They had 'My Best Friends Wedding' on the TV. For how friendly Tim was I wish that it as a little cleaner in there. Sanitary nail salons is IMPORTANT when they are poking you with tools. The tools were not pulled from those plastic bags you've seen so you don't know the cleanliness of those when the establishment itself was not clean. I will not be returning to this salon.",negative
"Love this place. Right down the street from my house and best thing they stay open until 8. Just like one of the other reviews said, they don't have a problem staying. I went in about 730pm to get a gel mani and gel pedi, the older lady took about an hour or so on my pedi, and even after was willing to do my mani. How sweet! Of course I told her I'd come back the next day, which yes I did. I love the guy, he is very friendly and loves talking. They are amazing with the massages!! Prices aren't bad, totally worth the services. And yes, they have tanning beds, eyebrow services, and do hair too. I definitely recommend this place!",positive
"Went in for acrylics on Friday and it was horrible! I've been getting acrylics for years and it has never been a problem to have them filed down...until this time. The tip of one finger was filed down so bad that it's blistered. (At least the nail tech put some antiseptic on it so it's not infected.) Also, when I put some lotion on my hands Tuesday a lot of my nails started getting sticky and filmy like they were going to disintegrate. NOT NORMAL! I removed mine today and found that my nails were finely filed, so it looks like they would have fallen off soon anyway. I'm not going back there again.",negative
"Terrible experience here. They cut up my foot when trying to remove a callus. Also, they told me they used shellac when it was really gelish. Wish I could recommend, but I wouldn't want anyone else to go through the same experience.",negative
"My natural nails were a mess so I decided to get acrylics. I looked on Yelp for a place close by, read the reviews and decided on Nail Tech Spa. My appointment was at 2:00. At 1:58 I called and said I would be a few minutes late, but I was close by. I arrived at 2:04 and was asked to sit and wait. 10 minutes later, I was told ""five more minutes"". I was finally seated in front of the nail tech at 2:45. I won't ""down"" rate the guy for this, though because he had run into an unexpected problem with the girl before me so it took longer than expected. My nail technician's name was Tim. I think he did a pretty good job. None of my nails have lifted so far (I just had them done yesterday). I didn't notice the variety of pre-painted nail tips hanging in cases on the wall until Tim had already stuck a few white ones on my fingers for a french manicure. Next time I have a new full set put on, I will try the pre-painted nails. I'll be back (mainly because I left my favorite water bottle there. I hope they saved it for me.)",positive
"AWESOME! This place is located in a nice cozy corner in the plaza on the SE corner of Thomas and Hayden. They do such a great job on your nails and they last forever! Not sure f they use some special serum to make them stay but-by god-it stays. Plus, they have a movie playing every time, not just muted TV so you can actually sit back and enjoy your service with some entertainment. I always end up watching something new as the owner goes to Blockbuster twice a week to have the newest releases there for everyone. Even cooler-they have tanning beds there, do waxing and eye brow shaping. This place is 'da bomb (and you know it's true because i never use that term ;) Hope this review helps put it on the map some more because they are so friendly and affordable. You'll love it.",positive
"I'm new to Ohio and needed an excellent hair salon I came across the reviews on yelp and they were not wrong about this place! I called this morning they got me in within a few hours and did a fantastic job! I will make sure I only use this hair salon! Jessica C is amazing !!! She treated me so well, was nice and listened to everything I said to make sure my hair turned out perfect! 5 stars from me!",positive
"I have been coming to NINA MICHELLE SALON for 14 years and more specifically to Mary Hora! No other stylist/hair artist is allowed to touch my crowning glory! Mary is a color specialist and stylist extraordinaire!!! Toni greets clients with a friendly smile. I always leave feeling pampered, relaxed and years younger! I do not hesitate to recommend this salon and Mary to you!",positive
"Very pricey for a cut and blow dry, but they use high end products and are thoughtful about the way they style your hair.",positive
Seriously impressed with Jessica. Wanted something new and she worked with me to develop a bunch of ideas that would actually be doable with my hair. Worth every penny and then some. Felt like a new man.,positive
I love Nina Michelle salon. My girl Dawn is the 'best' at making you feel beautiful & everyone there is amazing & welcoming.,positive
"Nina Michelle is the worst salon I've been to. The receptionists lost my appointment, the hair stylist damaged my hair with color and over charged me for a process I didn't ask for. Another hair stylist ignored what I asked for a cut and gave me the worst cut ever. Nina, the salon manager was negligent with even fixing any of these issues. Very unprofessional and greedy salon.",negative
"I have been to Kelly three times now. I have insanely thick hair and am trying to grow it out, and she takes such good care of me! In the past haircuts always took what seemed like hours, but she gets me in and out and it doesn't feel rushed at all. She does great work, and I highly recommend this place and Kelly to anyone in the area.",positive
"I had Dawn do a trim and bayalage treatment on my hair. I love it!! She provided a great consultation and knew what would look best. It is always nerve wracking going somewhere new for the first time, but I felt very comfortable. Wonderful salon, will be returning!",positive
If i could i wound give this place 0 stars. Its a dump. Pay a little extra and go get yourself a decent hair cut. Luis is either jabbering with walk in customers or his other workers during a cut. I give him instructions he does what he feels like anyway. Im leaving this place for good after coming here for a few months,negative
"I had a lousy haircut at this location by an older filipinos women, it was uneven and bad experience overall, worst haircut i've ever had.",negative
"The sign on the outside says ""Parkwood's Unisex Hairstylists"" so it is open to everyone. I've had haircuts from Kiko. Luis, Anna, and Olan. They all do excellent work. The cost is reasonable. Waiting is strange. There are no numbers. Some people are waiting for a specific barber and others are not. They know. You don't. So you might have 6 people waiting ahead of you and you could still be next. If it's a lot of younger guys waiting, they are most likely there for Kiko but not necessarily. There are usually women customers too. They tend to go to one of the two female barbers - excuse me- stylists.",positive
Great haircuts... humble barbers... welcoming environment... ask for Kiko or Luis but if the barber works there I'm sure you wouldn't be disappointed,positive
"Awesome place, great staff and excellent cut. I used to go to another place for years but switched over here after my first cut. They make you feel welcomed and Anna is awesome. Highly recommended!!!",positive
"Anna is my usual barber, she has amazing skills, but I think she's a little underestimated. I stopped paying 45 dollars + tip for haircuts ever since I found this place. Not only is she amazing at what she does she is no nonsense and does her job exactly how you want it. Terrific place! No more 45+ dollar haircuts when you get better service here. Give it a try!",positive
Great place. Friendly staff. Would recommend. This is CASH only. The food basics nearby offers cashback if you need to withdraw some :).,positive
"Loved my first visit, $15.50 a cut for men but the best part was the service, very professional and I felt just like at home. Switching my barber over here",positive
"Great place to get a very affordable men's haircut, complete with a professional straight blade and hot shaving cream finish!! Family run business for over 30 years.",positive
"I've had all but two haircuts in my life at Parkwoods Men's Hairstyling (30 years worth). This place is so much more than a barber shop to me; I have a really strong sentimental attachment to it. Anna and Lui (husband and wife/owners) are exceptional at what they do. Their attention to detail is impeccable, and their sense of humour and pleasant disposition makes getting my hair cut an enjoyable experience. Just to show you how nice these people are -- my older brother was extremely ill with a disease, and was unable to leave his house to get his hair cut. Anna went out of her way and came to him, and refused to take any money. That's the kind of people they are; pure class. I will continue to give them my business as long as they're open.",positive
"Disappointed. I tried this barber shop on the weight of one 'Yay! I'm a fan.' and one 'Woohoo! As good as it gets!' rating. The store is modest, old-fashioned and clean. The owner/staff are very friendly and seem eager to accommodate. The price is cheap. ($15.50 for my cut, including tax.) I called ahead to see if appointments were necessary (they're not) and if they could do a classic (old-fashioned) men's hair cut called a 'short back and sides'. I was assured that 'they all could do that'. Considering that I have had no luck finding a satisfactory execution of this seemingly easy to do cut, I showed up with a how-to diagram from an on-line catalogue of cuts and styles. The cut was just okay. It wasn't exactly was I was hoping for (and didn't match the schematic I provided), but I can certainly live with it. Marks deducted for needing to tidy up around one ear after getting home. Still need to decide if I'll go back and give them another shot or if I'll keep looking...",negative
"I tried this place after reading Jim's review. The place is nice, not too fancy and the service is great. I was very pleased with the hair-cut and for sure will go there again.",positive
"I've been getting my hair cut here for about 15 years, and I won't go anywhere else until my barber, Anna, retires. This is an old-school barber shop where you can get your hair cut for $15, with a shave for around $7 if you wish. The staff are very friendly and have been in the trade for a very long time. I highly recommend this place. It's a little hard to find if you don't know if it's there, as it's in the middle of Parkwoods Mall, which is an old-style Don Mills plaza, but it's worth stopping in, trust me.",positive
"Updating my review: I've been going here since my first review was posted and have always had no issues with the ladies who do the eyebrow threading. I went on a weekday (Wednesday) near closing time and oh god, a lady I've never had before took off a good chunk of both my brows for some unknown reason. I now have an ocean between my two eyebrows and I am so disappointed. (I hope it grows back quickly. Side note: immediately after this eyebrow disaster, I bought Full Brow Serum at Province Apothecary to grow back my newly created bald spots and it really has helped! So if my reality happens to you too, you're welcome.) I was noticing the threading took longer than usual and I thought, wow she must be putting a lot of effort into this! But no, not a good sign. I was still too non-confrontational and just said they look good and gave her a tip, but inside, I was weeping silently. WHY, WHY would someone think it's a good idea to remove like 2 cms of hair on the ends between the brows when there was no unibrow there before nor does it aesthetically look better to have such a wide space between two eyebrows??? I question whether she knew she effed up or she just has no visual comprehension of what looks good/bad and it's just a lack of skill as a previous reviewer mentioned. I would recommend the other ladies (which is why I left it at a 2 and not a 1) but not the one that wears a good amount of foundation. Nice person and all but wow, she must've realized that she took off way too much of my eyebrows that I look like a crazy person.",negative
"I've come here upon occasion over the past 5+ years. And each time I've walked away seriously disappointed. For some reason the staff here think they know what you want without ever asking you first. Which was why I would only come here when desperately in need of an eyebrow fix. And each time I would walk away with thin eyebrows (I naturally have thick and big eyebrows. I no longer go here for eyebrows, it's just not worth it. However, I had a specific recent incident I'd like to share with you about the staff at this location. I decided to get a full face without eyebrows done. What do you consider a full face? Because I consider it to be just that, my full face, without eyebrows. Apparently, the staff here feel otherwise. Or rather, they are highway burglars. Let me explain. I got myself those email coupons Perfect Threading offers, you sign up online. I set my appointment for 7pm (because apparently 7:15pm would have been late for them). I rushed over there after work on a Wednesday. I showed my coupon -- Wednesday's deal was something like 10% off, possibly with student ID. I was told that this coupon would not work for Full Face w/o Eyebrows since ""it's already discounted."" Uhmmm okay, the cost of this service is $26.55 (and up). So we get started. This lady does everything on my face below my nostrils. Then steps back as if she's done. I tell her to do between my brows and forehead area, and cheeks. She does. THEN SHE CHARGES ME FOR FULL FACE. Which is $30. The other staff member protested in Urdu/Hindi. She said ""but it's w/o eyebrows,"" to which my lady responded, ""I went up to her forehead. They did not think I could understand them. Excuse me?! I didn't fight it. I even tipped her. BUT I AM DONE WITH THIS PLACE. It is full of thieves who consistently take off more of your hair than you'd like. What is the point of having coupons if you won't accept them? What is the point of having prices if you're going to charge willy-nilly. Oh, by the way, there was no one there until I left at 7:15pm, the appointment time I initially wanted. It's not that paying over $30 was too much extra money. It's about the price you post, the deals you offer and not honouring either of those things. Moreover thinking you can charge me more because I don't understand what you're saying, because I don't look like you. Moreover, you're not even good at the service you're providing. You never ask what the customer actually wants, and do what you think is best. But what makes you an expert at knowing what's best for any particular person? I know these stores have almost a cult following due to prices and deals and the overall efficiency and timely service. However, you can find comparable pricing and better service elsewhere.",negative
Overcharged me - I was supposed to be charged $11 for the Wednesday Eyebrow & Upper Lip Threading not $15. Not happy about this. I was in a rush and didn't realize until I left that I was overcharged. I have been going to the Perfect Threading chain for a few years now and this was very disappointing. They were also distracted and talking to each other very loudly. They rushed the service. They left all the hair on my face and didn't give me gel. I would not recommend this location.,negative
"They thread eyebrows for men, which is good; some of these types of places refuse to do eyebrows for men, and some will only do it if you come in with a female friend. I walked in at a busy time and was served after 15 minutes, which wasn't too bad. The location is small and compact, from what I remember only have four chairs total. The person doing my eyebrows was friendly and efficient. The price was a little more than I expected, in scarborough I pay $7, I was charged $11.50.",positive
"I've been to this place twice since moving downtown, the people there are friendly and they offer a lot of services, such as man haircut for $9. I went there for threading and my first time was great I loved the shape of eyebrows, the girl removed all the tiny little hair away. I saw that they had a combo offer for Wednesday's $11 for eyebrows and upper lip and decided to give it a try. I think because they had so many people coming in for the combo my eyebrows were not at its greatest shape when I left. Overall a good place, but I would recommend to go during less busy days or hours.",positive
"I'm reviewing for Eyebrow threading only. But my experience doesn't let me want to try anything else there. I come to this location only because its very convenient but whenever I leave I regret it. It was no different this time. The eyebrow threading is very mediocre. Like the most ordinary job ever with a 50% chance of a screw up. I tried 3 different people (each time thinking it could be better by a different lady) but this wasn't the case. Yesterday my eyebrows looked completely different from each other and messed up. If i'm paying $10 I better be happy with it. I would not recommend this place. If you still want to take a chance on your looks, take it elsewhere. Atleast you'll have a better chance of having it done right.",negative
"Just came back from their eyebrow and upper lip threading combo for $11 and the lady who did it for me did an amazing job. She was quick, fast and professional. It was my first time threading and it was surprisingly more painful than I thought. However, due to the amazing results, this is going to be my go to method for facial hair removal. I will be back!",positive
"Don't come here. I had the ends of one of my eyebrows chopped up like by 1 mm. It looks awful and uneven while my other eyebrow is longer. She didn't thread the middle area in between my eyes. While getting my brows threaded I heard, the girl at the cash ask ""if this is your first time, here's a card, one free time after 10 times"". When I went up to pay, nobody offered me that. I had to say: it's my first time, do you have some sort of loyalty program? No lotion was applied afterwards. The chairs were dirty (I saw saliva spit on the edge of my reclining chair). It's a bunch of low class chatty Indian women working here with bad manners. Also, I came home and 2 hours later, a nice pimple popped up on the top of one of my brown The best place I've been to for threading is at Trade secrets at Eaton Centre downtown. I am never returning. Price: $9 before tax and tip.",negative
"Went for eyebrow threading, upper lip threading and underarm waxing just before my wedding. Mondays are 20% off waxing and Wednesday is a brow and lip special. They did a great job, were professional and had an appointment for the next day. My eyebrows look wonderful and I am very pleased. The whole thing took only a couple of minutes which was great, leaving me time to walk back up yonge street with a red and puffy face before lunch hour ended. No Frills but good service and excellent price.",positive
It hurts. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise. Threading is less destructive to your skin than waxing but it still hurts. I needed to get my eyebrows back in shape and happened to be wandering through the neighbourhood so I popped in. Nine bucks and ten minutes later my eyebrows are as good as new.,positive
"I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS PLACE GOT FIVE STARS. I typically go to the location at University & College, where there's a very sweet girl who does my eyebrows patiently, nicely, and does a good job. One day I decided to come to this location and I literally walked out with one and a half eyebrows. I don't know wtf was wrong with that lady - not only could I have done my eyebrows better myself but she also pretty much ruined them by trimming half of one off. When I pointed it out, she didn't even apologize and instead said I was being too picky. It's 2 weeks later and in case nobody knows eyebrows take a long time to grow in and my bangs still need to cover them and I nearly cried after walking out of this place. I'm not exaggerating about 1.5 eyebrows on my face - even my boyfriend noticed them and he's a guy. DO NOT GO TO THIS LOCATION. I would give it 0 stars if I could.",negative
I was paying $16.00 taxes included plus tip at a downtown salon until I found this place where I pay $9.05 ( taxes included) and really really love how the Asian lady works: fast and professional! I really recommend this place for threading eyebrows!,positive
"In the grand scheme of things, this is a fast, no frills, grooming hub. However, they are very good at what they do and usually have a daily special. I come here for my brows and have recently started to get bikini waxes. They use the pink cream wax- my favourite. There are 20% off waxing days, and on Wednesday an upper lip / eye brow threading combo deal. They also give a student discount. -- these are the specials that I utilize, I'm not sure what else they offer. There is a stamp card loyalty program. The reward is a free eyebrow threading. I usually drop in as I live down the street. Typically they are able to see me right away or after a ten minute wait. The longest I've ever had to wait was 30 minutes. But I ran some errands so it was no big deal. The spa is small and clean and the girls are fast and courteous. I have found that some will clean up my eyebrows, but I have to tell them I want my eyebrows shaped. Don't be shy, they will do it. Perfect threading is a great no fuss place for weekly maintenance.",positive
"I was looking for a affordable threading place downtown, and this is it. For $8 for eyebrow threading I got fast, professional service. My eyebrows look groomed, but still natural. A very convenient location, less than 2 minute from College station is another plus.",positive
"The newest location for this popular local threading salon chain is conveniently located in the heart of Toronto's Church & Wellesley Village. Close to the the College subway station, and across the street from the enormous Loblaw's at the Maple Leaf Centre, I was hyped that a threading salon opened in the area. The lack of a salon forced me to march over to the University Avenue location every now and then (schedule permitting) to get my brows back in order. Salon is small compared to the chain's other locations, but location is ideal. Great service, reliable threaders, and perfect results will now have me coming back more often as it is not too far from my home. I highly recommend threading over waxing due to the great shape your brows will look, but please be aware that it can be a painful experience for those with sensitive skin. Therefore, make sure to tell your stylist to take breaks every now and then so that you can regain your senses, especially when they're threading the bottom portion of the brow.",positive
"Terrible service! Unsanitary. Worst manicure/pedicure of my life! Along with horrible service! I walked In and she had the tools sitting on the table; I didn't see if they were sanitized or not. She had absolutely no idea what she was doing. She was rough despite my flinching, pushing my cuticles all over the place. At one point I pulled my foot back and yelled. She painted and repainted my toes several times because, again, she had no idea what she was doing. I was contemplating even doing the manicure but had to because I had a Groupon. I had to tell her to push my cuticles back before she started cutting. It seemed foreign to her. The nippers were going all over the place and I was afraid of her cutting SOMETHING off! She was painting my fingernails while they were suspended in midair (imagine that!) Without holding my fingers. I believe her name was mirna or something like that. Not that one person's name matters, they were all just the same because when I told someone how terrible and frightening the experience was, nothing was done about it. Don't even get me started on the checkout process when I told them I had a Groupon! I never went back to use my other manicure/pedicure deal! And needed to get the word out for others to save their money and time and potential loss of fingers/toes!",negative
"I had a positive experience with this salon when I went to redeem my Groupon. My technician was friendly and professional HOWEVER, my Groupon was for 2 manicures and pedicures services. I redeemed one and called back today to redeem my final session. The phone was answered by a less than friendly receptionist who asked me if I had any coupons for my service. I informed her of my Groupon that they should have in their file and how I would like to complete my second session. The receptionist respond ""the Groupons are Voided"". I asked, ""what do you mean they are voided I redeemed the deal before it expired and I still have one more session"". She responded, ""we voided them all"". Once again, I asked ""what do you mean it's voided?"" At that point she informed me the salon is under new management and they will not honor any of the previously sold Groupons. Beware if you have purchased any Groupon for this spa. You should probably contact Groupon and ask for a refund before it is too late. Due to my less than friendly interaction with the receptionist I will not be returning to this spa for services.",negative
Came in as a walk in.. was disappointed in the admosphere. You think with that kind of name it would be a spa type environment but its not. Asked for water like to of never got it. Got my hair colored loved it. Told her only minor trim. She cut my hair too short. Especially my bangs which I told her dad just fine. Love the color hate the cut. Great place for color would go back but not the cut.,negative
"I was getting married and looking for a place to get my nails done along with my bridesmaids the night before the wedding. I saw a Groupon for this place and called prior to purchasing to confirm they could fit us all in around the same time. I was told this wouldn't be a problem. I purchased the Groupon and called to make the appointment and was told there was no way they could fit us all in the night before because they only have 1 nail person after 4pm. This doesnt really make sense to me - not sure why they would cut back on staff once people get off work (this was on a Friday). I told them I had called the day before and they said it must have been a new person who gave me the wrong information. They then told me that some of us would have to book during the day and the other two could come at night. Although this was not ideal and I was not thrilled we made it work. My bridesmaid called the week before and then the day prior to confirm the appointments and they said we were all set. The day of the appointment, they called one of the girls and told them that they had double booked and couldn't fit her in at all that day. When we got there we told them that this was the second time that this had happened and that we were unable to come tomorrow due to the wedding. They managed to fit her in but seemed unhappy about it. The first group went during the day and the girls who did our nails all ""seemed"" nice. Then, the other two bridesmaids came later that night. The nail person was talking trash about us (not realizing the person she was talking trash to was also in the wedding party) saying that it was our fault they double booked and saying how she didnt like the nail colors the bridal party had chosen. My bridesmaid told her she was in the wedding as well and the nail person stopped talking pretty quickly but the damage was done. The moral of this story: Go here if you want bad service, a good chance of them lying to you and/or screwing up appointments, and then talking trash about you when you leave.",negative
I've had two great experiences at Pleasure Paradise in the past month or so. I first tested out the waters with Yvonne and had a lovely mani/pedi. I decided to go ahead and purchase a coupon to have my hair colored/cut/styled by Taryn. I can honestly say this is the first time I have walked out of a salon happy. Usually I walk out praying for my hair to grow faster or for the color to fade. Taryn was a master and did an amazing job. She was extremely friendly and I cannot wait to go back and see both her and Yvonne!,positive
"Hello, I had the pleasure of helping this team of great stylist in redesigning there new website and some promotional video's. These guys are defiantly one of the best salons out here in the west valley, expertise range in all areas when it comes to taking care of your body and making it look good! Defiantly a spot to visit and make it your salon you can call home!",positive
"I was surprised to not see more positive reviews and I am due for adding a new one, so here it is. My mom bought us a package deal for a massage, sparking apple cider lunch, manicure and pedicure. The place is very modern, clean and organized. They have changing rooms, lockers and showers. They even supply everything you need such as soap, body spray, hair dryer and even spray deoderent! First was the massages and don't be affraid to say more or less pressure. There is a waiting area with sofas where the light lunch is served along with sparking cider. I will say the only thing lacking was a tv, we wanted to watch the NASCAR race we were missing. After lunch along with a refill of sparking cider is the manicure/pedicure. It was nice to be in a place with newer pedicure chairs where all the buttons were in tact and working. If you go there, be sure to check out the manicure tables and cabinetry, interesting fact is that the owner's husband is a carpenter and made everything. It's very professional and upscale looking. I was impressed with the staff's knowledge and pride in her job to share. I would love to go back, I could use another ""spa day"" for some relaxation and for some reason the sparking cider tasted better there! **We used a Groupon deal and they were very friendly and we had no trouble at all. Owner (Jess) was very friendly as was rest of the staff.",positive
"Stay far away from this place, they can't color or cut hair, cost me 200. To fix what they screwed up. They have no idea what they are doing, my hair was falling out by the handful after it was fixed, they messed me up big time!!",negative
"I'm always complaining about the lack of customer service in Arizona, but if you go to Pleasure Paradise Salon you will NOT have any customer service complaints! Believe you me! I also had the best massage by Kimber. I'm always having neck / upper back pain because of stress & taking care of a young baby but Kimber gave my upper back so much attention that I finally found relief in my back. And everyone from was so nice! One stop shop for hair, body, & nail care!",positive
Pleasure Paradise is AWESOME! They are super clean & it is VERY nice inside. Their friendly staff & extensive selection of services are fantastic. The prices are very reasonable. Wanda & Greg are very talented. I will be recommending this salon to all my friends & family!,positive
"Absolutely terrible customer service. Whatever you do, do not buy a Groupon from this place. They will tell you that they have availability and schedule you. BUT when the owner (Jess) finds out that you booked with a Groupon he will call and say that you incorrectly booked their services and gives you dates two weeks away. The problem is that it was their employee who booked the reservation! Jess has to be the rudest small business owner I have ever dealt with. Not a good way to do business these days. I guess we will continue to frequent Dolce and get the experience we pay for. Note: the owner's wife called back and apologized for Jess's comments and tried to make accommodations. Unfortunately the damage was already done.",negative
"Great place for all kinds of services. All the stylists are very nice and accommodating. Huge on the inside and very clean. Greg did my spray tan and he was very professional and sweet. I would definitely recommend this salon for anything you need done. :) It is a little expensive, but overall, worth it.",positive
"Michelle is simply THE BEST. I have had other really good stylists before - I've lived in NYC and Montreal - but no one has been as good or as versatile or as open to trying new and interesting things with my curly hair, than her. She has never given me a bad haircut or colour. Ever. I get compliments all the time on my cuts. I completely trust her with my hair, which I have never done with anyone else after growing up in a small town in the 80s! Just last week I described a cut to her because I couldn't find the picture I wanted to show her, and she gave me exactly what I (poorly) described. Pretty crazy. I find most commercial salons exhausting, with tons of people rushing around and pounding music, all stressing me out. At Primped, you will have Michelle's complete attention - no minions to wash your hair - and a fantastic selection of her favourite music to keep you company. It is a calm and relaxing atmosphere, more like going over to your cool friend's house, rather than being in a dance club or a meat grinder. And have I mentioned that she's not just a brilliant stylist and colourist, but also a really great person? I couldn't recommend her more!",positive
"You know you have a great haircut when strangers tell you they love your hair!. No sooner did I get to Queen St W when a woman stopped me and asked me where I got it cut. Right around the corner, I said. Michelle has been cutting my hair for many years, .and it never gets stale. She is a terrific listener, who ""get's my style"" .Sometimes my ""bob"" is longer, or we choose a different cut on my bangs, Her studio uncluttered, and private.. Michelle also has a wonderful election of exotic teas. Happy, loyal customer Lydia Gorinas",positive
"I was looking online for someone new as I was tired of paying 150$ a cut at a salon in yorkville. The reviews are all great so I decided to go see her for a cut, when I went in my hair was past my shoulders midway to my breast. I had long layers my hair has body to it and it would air dry nicely like loose beachy waves. My hair was dry and I agreed to have the length shortened a bit to cut them out, I brought in pics to show exactly what I wanted so there would be no misunderstanding. To explain the length I would always put my hair in a messy bun on the top of my head as I have very thick hair. I was very specific that I don't like undercutting and stuff done to my hair as I like the thickness and big hair. The girl butchered my hair it is choppy short and completely uneven she also toned my hair and midway to the end is gray. When I wanted it be ombré / balayage she put highlights through the crown like in the 90s I was very specific and had pics.. I don't understand how she could have not got what I was explaining especially considering its the trend right now and u can see it in magazines and in the streets. When I left and saw myself in the mirror outside when I got into my car I started crying it looked so bad. I never post reviews especially negative ones but I'm supper pissed my hair looks like I have scissors to a kindergarten kid !! Beware the reviews below they have to be from her friends and not real clients I'm so angry everytime I look in the mirror I want to start crying ! I'm going to post pics so u can see what I mean",negative
Michelle has been doing my hair for five years. I just love her work. She is a genius with colour - so much so that people routinely see her work and think my (mouse brown) hair is naturally blonde. And I've had more compliments on my haircut since Michelle than in all the years before. I'm moving cities soon and will miss her a lot. Recommend!,positive
"Finding a really good hairdresser can be arduous. Luckily my search is over, because I found Michelle at Primped! I needed a major colour process done and was quite nervous about how it would turn out. I shouldn't have worried. Michelle is incredibly laid back and friendly, and her space is really welcoming and fun to be in. She stripped the existing black dye from my hair effortlessly and I emerged with a fabulous new red do, at a price that was much better than the others I had been quoted around town. A great fun experience, and I'm looking forward to my next visit. A++!",positive
"classic quote of the week via text: friend: where you at? me: toronto! friend: what the hell are you doing there? me: getttttting mah hurrrrrrr did friend:..... is that shanghainese ebonics? ah. to have not been raised in los angeles, what a travesty! Michelle Thompson is Toronto's best kept secret. And the only, ONLY reason i'm writing this is so that she'll get overbooked, and open up another location in los angeles. (pretty please?) going through random bouts of social ineptitude and overall bouts of disdain for the average clientele at hair salons (you know what i'm talking about), has precluded me from visiting any substantial hair salon. (in la at least). so through a series of freak accidents (i tried to trim my hair, and four inches later...yep. it happened, and i'm NEVER going near another pair of scissors again), my friend told me not to fret. his exact words: ""i've got the best hair stylist. she'll fix it. she'll make you gorgeous"". pause. ""....not that you're not gorgeous now."" second pause. Michelle's studio is a skip away from the nearest streetcar, so you can literally get off, and walk straight for the blue building. She came out to meet us (in the freezing weather that is Toronto in January), and my spidey senses were tingling. i liked her immediately. ok, it might've been the hot black boots, and her perfect hair. maybe..MAYBE. who doesn't need some eye candy in negative 7 degrees? walking into her studio is like walking in to the tardis from doctor who. the place keeps stretching and stretching. it's an absolute full salon, with all the amenities, and no douchebaggery. tunes are mellow and pumping in the back, and smokey, her lovely grey kitty makes eyes at me while i sit and get my hair detoxified and fixed. chatting with michelle was an absolute pleasure, and seeing the hairstyle come into its own was quite gratifying. With over 20 years of experience, she'll give you an objective opinion on what looks best on you, and though I would have never chosen the specific hairstyle I ended up with, i've gotten nothing but compliments. if you're into quality one on one time, with a person who's sole purpose there is to beautify you, i'd suggest you book her immediately. i can tell you now, no one's touching my hair unless it's Michelle... or Smokey. And to think, all it took was a 5 hour flight out of the country to get my first haircut. Book her. Now. Before I Kidnap Her.",positive
"I got a gift card from my Mother in law for Christmas to try this place out. I scheduled a Thai facial, Express mani with shellac, and a spa pedicure. When I got there i was taken back for my facial. she did the steam and wiped my face and then put a mask on and left the room. she was gone for a solid ten minutes, came back in did the same thing and then left the room again!!! In my experience with facials when you get the mask portion of the facial they do a massage, not here! She didn't do any extractions either, I actually didn't even see any equipment there to do them! They did the wrong facial as well, they ended up giving me a signature facial instead of the thai facial. Also, i didn't go in for my HOUR facial until 9:40 and she was done at 10:20. So i was not happy when i came i out from my facial and actually canceled my pedicure cause i didn't want to waste my money! When i got the manicure they informed me that they hadn't scheduled me for shellac ( even though i was very specific on the phone when i scheduled it) and said that the person that does that isn't available. I told them that was fine, i just wont get the manicure cause regular polish does not stay on my nails. Then all of a sudden they could do it? But now two days later i already have THREE chips and their color selection was very minimal. Instead of being a relaxing experience it was a frustrating and irritating one.",negative
Best massages ever. I drive from an hour away. The room is relaxing and the staff are professional. I've tried other places close to home and nothing measures up to the standards of Q's. I've been coming to this place for 6 years. I'd love for you to open one closer to Mansfield,positive
Owner does not care about good or sub par customer service. She is the reason I tell everyone who asks what a bad experience I've had there. She just doesn't care!!,negative
"The manicurist was rude- just making little digs about how she could tell I'd last clipped my toenails myself, etc- and when I requested a French manicure, she told me she couldn't do one. Could not!! Another manicurist in the room also informed me she couldn't.",negative
I recently went to Qs Spa for the first time I was amazed by the phoenominal customer service they do and all the services they offer! This is by far the premiere Spa in The Medina area and I highly reccomend it!,positive
I have been to q 's spa several of times for different services and have always been pleased. I have had scoliosis and back aches ever since grade school and coming to Q for massages is even better than the chiropractor. She uses great technique. I also used to get my nails and hair done here regularly before I moved and have always been more than pleased. Great customer service. Sad that I had to move because it's hard finding a new spas/salon in cities you are new to.,positive
I am a local golf professional and director of the Greg Jones Golf Academy. Often times my neck shoulders and back are in a lot of pain. I've tried many massage salons and have for the most part been very satisfied with the service and atmosphere. After going to Q's I will only be going there. I was very impressed with the atmosphere and service at Q's Spa. Top notch massage and just what I needed. Golfers needing relief from pain this was a great message and I would recommend them highly. Thank you Greg Jones,positive
"I hate to give this place only two stars, because every service I've ever had done there, aside from one shellac mani, has been wonderful. I've continued to return for hair cuts and highlights and have had several manis and pedis there as a part of different bridal parties. I've attended their ""birthday party"" open houses and have even recommended to a friend who was getting married and several of us from her bridal party went in for multiple services the day before her wedding. The reason behind the two stars is the business ethics - or lack there of! I've had a handful of bad experiences, and after my next scheduled appointment (because I don't want to cancel on my stylist and I like how she does my hair) I will no longer be returning to Q's. Once I had received a coupon in my email for a free haircut with any color...I got a partial highlight with two colors, and a cut, went to checkout and was told that because I wasn't a new customer they couldn't give me that coupon. No where on the coupon, at that time, did it state that I had to be a first time customer...now on every single one they send out it's stated right below the special. I told them that they should acknowledge the coupon because it was their mistake, but Q couldn't understand what I was trying to say and offered me 10% off instead. 10% off was about $11...vs the $35 I spent on the haircut...hmm... The final straw comes with my next and last appointment. In May when I visited with the bridal party Q told me to make sure I wrote my email address down because she wanted to offer me a special for the next time I was in for my hair as a thank you for bringing in so many people for services and exposing her business. Great, that's so nice! Well. I scheduled my appointment online and left a note about this asking she or Phil to call me to discuss so I would know what to expect when I went to checkout. I hate going to the register and being surprised by a HUGE, unexpected bill because there's nothing to do at that point but pay it. I didn't get a phone call, so I took it upon myself to call. I did, left a voice mail asking about it so that I could budget - we're talking about a difference of $75 vs $130+ which is a big deal to me. I get a call back and on my voicemail am again told that if I'm a first time customer I will get a free haircut with any color...great but um..I've been there at least 6 times... I called back, leaving another message, this time with full details, making sure to use terms like ""honor your word"" and ""brought in several girls for multiple services, you offered me a special as a thank you""...I immediately got a call back and had the chance to talk with Q - OH! she had forgotten that she'd marked a $15 off offer on my sheet. Okay great! So then I ask if I can use the $15 off, with the 10% off that I (and everyone else in their mailing list) received in my email. I was told that I couldn't do both together. Well, that stinks, especially because the services I get done actually leave the 10% off as a better deal than the $15 off she gave me as a thank you. Since I can't use them together I was told to ""use the 10% off for this trip and then save the $15 for my next""...basically her way to get me in the door again...that's not going to happen. If you want to thank someone, THANK them, give them a special that is actually a special, and stick to your word. I've had too many conversations that just go around and around and leave me confused and angry that I just give in, pay the money and leave...that's no way to feel after a day at the spa/salon. No thank you. I'll let my stylist know that I won't be returning so that if she leaves, like so many others, she can let me know what salon she ends up at.",negative
"Something hubby and I like to splurge on is massage, specifically couples massage. Just as it sounds, couples massages are body kneading treatments that happen while laying in side-by-side beds in the same dimly lit room. We have had massages outside on a sunny day and inside during a blizzard. I've lost count of how many spas we've been to in the three states we've lived in, but each one had its own flair. The first couples massage we ever booked was at a luxury hotel in Los Angeles. They had us wear disposable underwear (!?) and lay face down as our therapists worked our muscles like silly putty. Our masseuses were short, stocky, Asian women who, at one point, climbed on top of our backs and dug in to our shoulder blades with their knees (!?). A few days ago, we went to a spa in town called Q's Spa. It's owned by a lovely woman named Q, who is petite, yet gives a hardy massage (she gave me mine). We started our visit with a tour of the facility, then were shown to our room where we changed in to white terry cloth bathrobes and slippers. Before the massage, we had a second room all to ourselves, with a display of grapes and strawberries, crackers, wine, and assorted chocolates. The steam closet was only a few paces away, so we alternated between the snack table and the room set to 98 degrees with 3000 percent humidity. Aside from dodging the hot water dripping from the ceiling, it was pleasant. Take-your-breath-away-while-sweating-out-toxins pleasant. Our massages were the highlight of our visit. We each had our own therapist who did well to work out the kinks with their hands and elbows. While they kept their feet on the ground, their use of hot stones sent me to La La Land in no time. After every treatment like this, I am reminded of what butter must feel like slowly melting on top of a Belgian waffle dressed in vanilla cream resting on top of rainbows and cotton candy clouds.",positive
"UPDATE: as soon as I posted my previous review (the next morning), staff had contacted me to see if I would come in and give them an opportunity to fix it. I spoke with Jenna who was so sweet and understanding, really made me feel as though she wanted me to come back and be happy with my hair. Kimberly was the stylist who fixed my hair, she took her time looking at it and even got a second opinion from another stylist, I could tell she really cared that my hair worked out. She spent hours putting in fine highlights, which turned out beautifully and did a great job blending the highlights from before (pictures below). I am actually super excited about my hair now and will definitely be back. I would definitely give 5 stars for the second visit!",positive
"For the last four years I have been in search of a consistent, creative and talented hairdresser. I first heard about RedBloom Salon at a bachelorette party where I met two women who had amazing haircuts and they both had hair stylists from RedBloom. I later discovered that a friend has been seeing the owner for over twelve years but she informed me that he is no longer taking on new clients. When I called to make an appointment they were all quite booked up but I was determined to wait as it has been a struggle for me to find the perfect hairdresser. The salon is located in a shopping complex filled with upscale shops and the salon was no exception. Please note that their address does not work in a GPS so I recommend going ahead of time because it is easy to get lost if you are not familiar with the area like me. When I arrived I was offered tea or coffee while I waited and they had me change into a comfortable smock. My stylist was prompt, polite and very nice to talk to. When she asked what I wanted to have done I told her that she was the artist and asked for her suggestion. Without hesitation she layed out her game plan, then went to the back and priced out two options and brought the info back to me on a small white board for me to view. As I have long hair, my first option was approx $250 for a cut and highlights and second was cheeper but for fewer highlights. I went with the first as I was in dire need of a full makeover...and that is what I left with! Each stylists pricing differs depending on experience. My girl was a mid level rating so I expect that the price varies within the salon. Since then I have returned again to the same girl with the same amazing results. I have another appointment next week.....here are a couple of other things that I look forward to when I go: The ambiance is nice...music is not blaring and the decor is very modern with a slight industrial look. All of the stylist take their time washing your hair, with an amazing scalp massage...they also massage your hands and fingers with lotion! Afterwards she wrapped my hands in hot towels and put one over my eyes. After your haircut they take you to the front where they have a makeup booth set up...they refresh your makeup and then you are on your way. I noted two things on my visits that I also want to make note of. If you are short like me the hair washing station may be uncomfortable for you and or drip water down your back. The other thing is that they really need to choose a better quality coffee to serve as I could hardly choke it down! Other than those two things which are not that important I would recommend this place in a heartbeat.",positive
I switched over here because my hair dresser moved locations. Same great place but a huge bonus is free parking which I enjoy since I got tickets everytime I was parked at the other location.,positive
"I've been going to RedBloom in Bridgeland for about a year now. Until then I had always had trouble finding someone that could deal with my super straight, fine hair. I must admit I was a bit nervous to try them and didn't know what to expect when I first entered the salon and was given a robe to put on. But the experience has always been great! They give you a robe, offer you a drink, give a scalp/shoulder massage at the beginning of the appointment, and everyone is always very pleasant and helpful. I haven't seen anyone other than Christy R., but she's great and I can't say enough good things about her! She always takes a few minutes to sit and chat with me about what I want before she starts doing anything. And I've never gotten as many compliments about my hair as I have since seeing her. I'm going to keep seeing her and would highly recommend both her and the salon to anyone looking for a great hair experience!",positive
"I chose a senior stylist because I wanted to be sure that I would get a 'good cut'. I was super surprised at the low quality of my cut. I was not happy when the stylist could not style my bangs - at all. I had to leave the salon with my bangs sticking straight out from my forehead! As I was paying, there was another client who was leaving with 'party-ready' (It was the Christmas party season) hair - I was not. I had to go home and try and fix my bangs! Overall, the hairstyle had some layering, but the length was left too long providing me with an odd difference between the length and the first layer. A little mullet-like. Also, I felt the stylist was very quick cutting my hair and did not spend enough time on details. (I was there just over 30 mins. for $80) I had also provided a picture of me with my hair how I liked it and I had told the stylist it was important to me to have a 'good cut'. I had to go to two Christmas parties with this shoddy cut. I was pretty disappointed as this was the second time I had been to Redbloom in Bridgeland. The first time was with a junior stylist and again the cut was awful, but I thought that trying a senior stylist would solve the quality of cut problem. I thought I would try Redbloom again because I had mostly read really great reviews on Yelp. This appt. was 8 days before Christmas, so when I brought my disappointing style to RedBloom`s attention, they offered to squeeze me in, in the next week. Unfortunately, I had booked the appt. ahead of time knowing I would be getting busy prior to Christmas - I mean who isn`t? I was not able to make it back before Christmas and ended up cutting some of the length off myself so it was not so mullety. I mean who wants a mullet???",negative
"Colour me impressed (and pardon the pun). I had a great first experience at Redbloom. Right from the start at reception they were professional and friendly. It is a lovely salon without being stuck up and pretentious. It was clean and well maintained compared to many I've been to around 17th ave. They do all the usual stuff of a higher end salon PLUS nice added touches like hand massages. My stylist Jami was a great listener and offered some good ideas on how to tame my lion's mane of hair. And she delivered. I have thicker, wavy hair and in the past have had stylists run screaming but she patiently worked with my hair and gave me awesome highlights and a great cut that made the most of the beast that is my hair. She took her time, in a good way and I am very happy with the results. She helped me choose product that would help be maintain the beast without hard selling. And I found the cost of the cut, highlights AND product all together was cheaper than most other similar salons I've been to in Calgary. Score! While I still need to do the wash-it-and-do-it-myself test, I am confident that Redbloom is worthy of the 5 stars.",positive
I used to get my haircut at Diva downtown Calgary but I followed my hairstylist Nikki to Redbloom in Bridgeland. Nikki is the absolute best She is so warm and kind ...and of course gives the best haircut ever!!!! I recommend this salon as it very nice inside and everyone is attentive.,positive
"Seeing as MeghanH below referenced my experiences in her review, I felt I should put my own two cents out there.!! AWESOME! I am very loyal to a good stylist (or maybe Im too lazy to look for new ones), but I know a great one when I find one. I found one at Redbloom 3-4 years ago now and am still a huge fan. I have been getting my hair cut by Christie R for for ages and even followed her during a hiatious to another salon (thankfully she returned back to this location which is conviently 2 blocks from my house). Christie is so easy to chat with (be it movies, TV, old and new flames or me trying to decide on the color of the week) and does an amazingly consistant cut each and every time. Her colors/highlights also turn out perfect every time I have had to cover the ""arctic grey"". The salon atmosphere itself is FUN, easy going, not pretentious and the staff are extremely friendly and professional. Perks include the hot towels after a shampoo (niiiice after a long work day), hand massages while processing color and a shoulder massage while getting going.! The full experience is quite a treat and doesn't feel like a chore to squeeze in during a busy week. The fact it is an Aveda salon is also a huge draw seeing a Shampure is the best shampoo on the planet and the mens styling products have been a fav of mine for 10 years. At last count I had a partner, a sister, a mother and coworker all going to this location and everyone is a fan...so rest assured - you won't be disappointed. I also just noticed my last cut converting itself to ""hockey hair""..so I need to get an appointment lined up asap.",positive
"Finding a new stylist, or leaving your current stylist, as you know is a very complicated process. It's like breaking up with someone, without all the drunk texting. I enjoyed my previous stylist for the fundamentals but decided to buy a Groupon for Red Bloom based on my brother's experiences with it. There is plenty of parking around the Bridgeland shopping area, so you'll have no trouble there. RedBloom uses AVEDA products and the AVEDA techniques for styling and colouring. You are in for an absolute treat. Upon entering, a nice receiptionist always welcomes you and offers to take your coat. You change into a nice little robe and are always offered a drink. (Not sure if they serve alcoholic drinks or not) The waiting area is always nice and clean and you usually aren't waiting there for too long. I have been seeing Ashley, an intermediate stylist for about a year now. She is a sweet girl with great talent. RedBloom charges by the type of stylist: student, intermediate, advanced and Master. But I imagine anyone you get will be amazing given the way Aveda teaches their students. While your colour processes, the stylist provides hand massages using Aveda hand cream. So awesome. I feel Ashley always spends a lot of time styling my hair, and ensuring all roots are thoroughly covered. There have been a couple of times when I have requested something that has taken longer than my appointment allowed and Ashley was great to accommodate. There was even a time when we stayed past closing! When you are all done, they always offer to touch up your make up with some lip gloss and translucent powder. What is better than that for a night out? Nudding! The price is just below other high end salons I would say. I pay about 170$ for colour and cut. Maybe even less than that. I highly recommend this salon for men and for women. I've even recommended my mom! It's a family affair down at RedBloom Bridgeland. Which reminds me, I have to make an appointment, the tall men in my office are commenting on my gray hair again :S p.s. One time when getting my hair done, I saw a stylist shaving skull and crossbones into a young boy's head. It was probably the coolest cut I have ever seen on a child. Even for kids' cuts they are the coolest.",positive
"I've been to both of the Red Bloom Salons and I have been happy with both. I am busy and my schedule is erratic and it is difficult for me to make appointments too far in advance. I usually just call on the day that I have time and find out if there is any stylist open. The folks who answer the phone are helpful and if I can't get in with the stylist I have used in the past - they will make a suggestion. I usually know what I want done when I go it, but the odd time I will ask for a suggestion. The stylists are helpful and friendly - I get the feeling that they like where they work and it makes a huge difference in their service. The details are what make this salon my favourite: a head and shoulder massage before they start, and the offer of a hot towel at the end. Not one who usually likes being pampered - it is pretty hard to resist, and I am always happy I accepted when its done.",positive
"I've been going to RedBloom ever since I moved to Calgary a couple years ago and into the Bridgeland area. I've always had great service from reception to the stylists I've seen there. Only once have I had an issue and it was corrected on my next visit(saw a different stylist). I've always seen a senior stylist there each one I've seen I've appreciated the time they've taken to do a proper consultation plus each time I go in, another quick consultation to check in and see if I'm happy with my previous cut and if there is anything different that should be done or changed. I look forward to my next visit there. 7/30",positive
"I came home for Christmas and was in desperate need of a haircut for the holidays. I couldn't wait to get to my usual guy in Vancouver so I asked for some recommendations and heard that Billie at Redbloom was great. Billie was more than great - she's FANTASTIC! I always get a bob, which happens to be her favorite. Each time I get my hair cut I try to explain that I want the back shorter with lots of shape and volume. This was the first time I was told by a stylist there were two ways she could to the cut: one would keep more length (a request I have for growing my hair for my wedding) and one that would add a ton of volume to my fine hair but would be a bit shorter. I opted for the latter and it is AMAZING! It's what I always wanted but never articulated. I loved that Billie took the time to listen and gave me options. I love her passion for bobs! Plus she is super sweet and I got to eat a delicious cookie that she baked!",positive
"Stylish, modern and vibrant, an expensive treat for a bad hair day. Ultimately I go to Red Bloom for two reasons, my stylist (Brandy) and the environmentally friendly, high performance products of Aveda. Red Bloom is always aware of the latest and greatest trends and when you like to change your hair colour as often as I do, that's a great thing. Recommend a friend and receive $10.00 off of your next hair cut. A high-end salon that can guarantee perfect results at a cost.",positive
"Best eyebrow threading I've ever had! Tatianna takes her time and keeps my eyebrows perfect every single time. I am very picky and have had my eyebrows done for many years, she is the best!",positive
"Great haircut in CU. It's a bit pricey and they do take some time to get to you, but I think it's worth it. Other places in CU don't seem to take their time on your hair the same way Rkooa does. If you aren't sure on how you want your hair cut, they ask for details and help you work through it. They do ask that you download an app called Mahu and save your spot in line, but this makes sense since you don't want to be waiting at the shop for hours. They let you know when they're ready for you through the app! Everyone working there is really friendly too. I heard really good things about eyebrow threading as well!",positive
"Ladies, ask for Tatiana to get your eyebrows threaded! She is amazing!! Super nice & amazing at her job! I was nervous coming down to U of I trying to find a new eyebrow lady, but now I don't want my eyebrows done anywhere else! Be patient though. Perfection takes time, and Tatiana never disappoints!",positive
"Dennis is one of my go-to barbers for my fade. He makes sure to do it exactly as I ask and will let me look at different top lengths, and their scheduling app let's you come in without waiting",positive
"Please, do not frequent this establishment for a haircut. Notice that the only two reviews are for eyebrow threading. Let me give you a ""feel"" for this place. - The barbers are all African and frankly, they are a bit brusque and pushy. They had the Television on high the whole time and one of these guys just sat and stared at the TV the entire time. My barber would pause to watch the television while cutting my hair....and I mean pause 5-15 seconds. - They force everyone to sign into this stupid electronic system instead of just making people wait and it is a mess. If you do not have a smartphone or just don't feel like giving them your information, they make you feel uncomfortable. - They do not have the prices posted. Yes, this is getting to be like Africa.... My barber charged me 22$ for a haircut that he messed up on. I came back, and talked to Tatianna...I guess... and asked ""how much does a haircut cost here?"" I wanted to check the price prior to asking for a fix. She told me ""oh, it depends...you know, depends on the barber, what he feels like, what you work out with him?"" So, I ask her what the heck is going on here, what is the limit. She says ""oh, between 16 and 23 dollars."" My barber never asked me a thing, he just charged me the money. - The clientele is either African American, or people looking to get David Beckham style haircuts. They all probably love using their app so sign in to the waiting list, don't mind that their barber is watching a TV show while cutting their hair, and will continue to come back and waste over 20$ at a time. Definitely not a traditional, professional, high quality barber shop. - Of, and of course, no shaving your neck for 20$, no hairwash, not even putting down some aftershave lotion on the neck. Let me also add that my barber mad-handled my head, didn't say a word the whole time, and was basically surly. If you want to waste your money, experience some shady business, and maybe get a David Beckham cut, come to these guys....if you want a traditional cut, or even something affordable, go elsewhere.",negative
"This is where you go for a proper fade from a real barber. The guy has been cutting hair in Champaign for 10+ years so you can't go wrong. I wanted a traditional tapered fade and couldn't find that in Champaign but Ray took care of it. You can pay with a credit card also so that was convenient. The best way is to make an appointment and the best way to do that is to download their free app called Mehu. Its all self explanatory after that, but you'll be able to make the appt and then it will give you updates as your time slot approaches via the app also. Be sure to select Ray. What you see is pretty much what you get, you won't be dissapointed. I've included the links for the app below and also some pictures so you get an idea.

"I too, left several messages without a return call. I'm new to the area and met someone who is friend of Amy so I thought I would try this salon out. But after reading reviews on several sights, I'm glad I didn't go. I ended up going to Living Art and was extremely happy.....what a difference in professionalism.",negative
been twice to Amy and she really listens to what you want. I feel like I am not rushed and she isn't wanting to get me out of there. I texted her with follow up questions when I panicked it was too dark and she immediately got back to me and wanted to make sure I was happy. It's not super fancy salon but definitely relaxing and enjoyable.,positive
"Don't bother calling. They don't need any new business. I left a message first thing yesterday morning and it's 2 PM the next day and no one has called me. I could go on with what a terrible, terrible idea it is to have new clients call and leave a message for a particular stylist when their social media all the highlights one person in particular, so I don't know who else works there. But at least call me back and let me know that you are busy, so I can make an appointment elsewhere, if I did happen to ask for the stylist with the most clients since that was the only name I knew.",negative
"Loved my stylist, Amy! She really listened and asked questions to see exactly what I wanted for my hair. I definitely will be back!!",positive
"Want a disaster? Head on in! Amy should start by heading back to school...or perhaps hanging up her clippers. For a janky strip mall experience with shoddy expertise and uptown pricing, head to Salon 160.",negative
Tiffany did a great job with my hair! She made perfect recommendations and did quality coloring. I highly recommend this salon.,positive
"I've been going to Delores for almost four years - I don't trust anyone else with my hair! Not only is she funny and personable... she is an actual hair wizard! I'm someone who likes to change up my hair pretty much every season. Delores always nails the look I'm trying to achieve, and does so in a way that keeps my hair looking and feeling healthy! Another huge benefit of seeing Delores is the super easy booking process. You can book with her on styleseat.com, find dates/times that work for you and set up your card to make the payment/tip process seamless. Her rates are extremely affordable, especially considering the quality of her work. The salon is spacious, clean and full of great products. I can't say enough great things about Delores and Salon Lulu!",positive
"I have been a stylist at Salon Lulu for some time, and if you're a stylist looking for a home, look no further! Linda is amazing, kind and hard-working. We love her! The salon is clean and professional, you'd love it here. If you're someone looking for a new stylist, each stylist works individually scheduling their own appointments and can be found at the website luluhairsalon.com. Each stylist has their specialties and if you're looking for something specific just call and ask, we're happy to refer you to the best fit. I am a balayage/ cut / curly hair stylist and have included a few pictures of my work for you to check out. If you like, you can book appointments with me directly by texting 845.444.0963 or visit styleseat.com/deloresturnbow to view my schedule and pricing online. My Instagram @ddelorable for more pictures of my work Thanks for reading!",positive
"ASK FOR Delores! I wanted a red blend and needed a hair cut that let my hair grow out naturally and be low maintenance, so looked for a hair stylist for months! Found her and she did not disappoint ! Worth every penny and it still looks gorgeous!",positive
"I gave 1 star only because it wouldn't let me do no stars. This was a very bad experience for me! I was at the salon for 5 hours, and it cost me $192.00 for a color. Christine Davis was the stylist. I came in with a picture of what I wanted. When she was done my hair looked hideous. I was devastated. I called Christine the next day to find out what we could do. She was rude, and mean. I was depressed and couldn't leave my house for days. I have never written a review before, but I feel the need to try and help someone else from this experience.",negative
I found this on Yelp when driving through AZ. THey are the best and now I drive 10 hours to go to LULUs to get my hair hilighted!! They are def worth it!!,positive
"SHOUTOUT TO INDIA! WOOT WOOT! By far best experience, so professional, very high class. Cozy chairs and great comolimentery drinks. Great experience! Will definitely go back, she did bleach to evening out my fine straight brown hair and gave me tips that would fit within my budget. Thanks a million, definitely going back and very affordable too!=) Thanks Lulu!",positive
My family and I recently moved to Tempe from San Diego and I was needing a cut bad! I saw reviews for Jessica then looked up her Instagram and saw more of her work and really liked what I saw. I booked an appointment with her and yesterday she cut/highlighted my hair and I LOVE it! She checked often about the length I wanted and did a perfect blend between the 2 photos I showed her. She also is so kind and easy to talk to! I'm glad I found someone quickly to do my hair who is so professional and super sweet. Thanks Jessica!,positive
"I see Jessica here and she just does an absolutely amazing job on my hair. She's very responsive to requests and meticulous in her work. I've been seeing her for over a year now and I get constant compliments from friends and strangers on my hair. Definitely A+. The salon itself, just a heads up, doesn't seem to staff a receptionist? So all scheduling etc is done by the individual stylists. So just be aware when you come in and you don't immediately have someone there to greet you/man the phones etc.",positive
"Jessica McClean is a very talented hairstylist, knows what she is doing! I have been her client for 2 years now,she makes you feel relaxed and comfortable while getting your hair highlighted & cut. She uses great products, very up to date on current styles & trends. I am very happy with my hair, love the results every time! She is fantastic!!! Salon LuLu provides a relaxing environment,easy to find, plenty of parking. I highly recommend Jessica!",positive
"I discovered this salon about a year ago so decided to give it a try. Erin, the owner, is absolutely amazing. She listens to what I want, gives me suggestions, and in the end I love the results. I would recommend Erin to all my family and friends.",positive
"Cute, small, trendy salon. Clean with friendly staff. Jessica was awesome, trimming my hair exactly as I asked- we were totally on the same wavelength. I appreciate places that rent chairs to their stylists so they are paid what they are worth, and this place does it. No high pressure product sales.",positive
So happy to have found this salon with my favorite hair stylist Christine. I always can trust her with a great cuts and perfect color. Whether it's highlights low light or some combination the color always comes out just right. She also uses very high quality products so my hair feels fantastic. And suggests other products I can use at home to keep it that way. So the results my hair always looks healthy and fantastic!,positive
"First impressions are everything... I just walked in to see if they had walk-in availability. One staff member looked at me then looked right back at their phone and didn't say a word. Finally, someone greeted me. Mind you there was about 10 feet between me and that person. I then asked if they could squeeze me in for a trim and the one stylist that was asked responded that ""she had an appointment in 30 mins"" I had to reply and say ok so does that mean you don't have time?? It's like no one knows how to talk there... Either they are all too busy or they just don't know what customer service means, or both. They could have just earned a new client. Oh well...",negative
I love this salon! It's clean and relaxing. Jasmine is the best! She is full of energy and always makes my hair feel fabulous! She takes her time and makes sure I am completely happy before I leave. Jasmine is someone I would recommend to anyone who is looking for a stylist who is passionate about their work. She is honest and walks you through the process so you are aware of the stages and what's going on. She is so knowledgable and gives feedback on how to improve your hair and look your best! She is truly the BEST and she will be stuck with me and my hair forever!,positive
"The salon is decent not great, I was a walk in appointment and felt rushed out. There was color from the dye stained on my face ears and neck when I left because she didn't wipe it off while it was wet. She also didn't show me a sample of the dyed hair while I was picking a color, so that I could make sure it was what I wanted like salons normally do. I showed her a picture and she chose the color, which didn't turn out the same color or even close to it. I won't be going back.",negative
I love coming here! Lorraine has been doing my hair since September and I'm always pleased with the results. I came to her based on a referral when I was looking to change stylists. Lorraine knows what she's doing and strives to give you what you want. She's a sweetheart and lots of fun to talk to.,positive
I have been going to Salon Lulu since it opened. I absolutely love how clean it is and all the independent employees are super sweet and professional. I would recommend this salon to everyone. Jasmine has been doing my hair for years and she does a great job. I would recommend Erin also who is super sweet and does a great job doing hair.,positive
"Lorraine has been styling my hair for the last 6 years. I have literally followed her to multiple locations. I did try to find someone else closer to my side of town to color and cut my hair but I never left feeling like a movie star. So I went back to lorraine and decided it was worth the drive since I trust her with my life when it comes to my hair. She understands my hair like no else and makes sure she understands what I want done before she proceeds. If she ever has to cut more than 1 or 2 inches when you are asking for a trim, she will first let you know what is going on with your hair for her to suggest cutting more than necessary and then asks you if it is ok. She NEVER cuts off your hair without your consent. She is a wonderful stylist and everyone always asks who does my hair. I literally get compliments on my hair every day. I have red hair and an A line Bob. If you want to leave the salon feeling like a celebrity ask for Lorraine. She is the best!",positive
"I love this place! The first thing to note, is each chair is rented to different stylists so it's not a corporate set up like Ulta or other salons in the valley- it's like mini businesses within a business so pricing completely depends on who you are seeing. I have been going to DeDra for 5 or so years now and she is absolutely amazing. I get compliments on my hair almost on a daily basis; she really understands color, flattering cuts, and can explain why something may or may not work because of your hair type or texture, etc. Being that I have followed this one amazing stylist all over the Chandler area through the years, I feel like I have a pretty good idea of what salons have it, and which are lacking. Salon Lulu is super clean, updated and by no means has that gaudy decor that seems to be a running a muck (gotta love those places that have giant gold painted cherubs on the walls with fake ivy plants or massive chandeliers made of pink and black plastic beads so you feel like you're somewhere ""classy""). It's got a great vibe from the diverse group of stylists that are there and there is a fantastic lack of caddy and petty women. Everyone is super nice and helpful from my experiences and everyone seems to jive well together. I dig it!",positive
"I love Erin as a stylist, she has been doing my hair now for several years. She has always been very professional and courteous. I would follow her, wherever she sets up shop in the metro area. Just got my hair done today, and as always perfect cut and color. Love her!!!",positive
Beautiful updated salon. Comfortable atmosphere. Well trained stylists. I would trust anyone at Salon Lulu with my hair. They also have a nail tech and an esthetician.,positive
"They should rename this place Salon Lu-ser. I went in to have my bangs and ends trimmed. Unfortunately for me, I left with an uneven chop shop looking mess and six inches in length cut off. Between the abysmal stylist Lorraine and the argumentative salon manager Erin, I'm not sure what was more disappointing. I wanted a refund for several reasons; I hate my hair, I asked for a trim and left with lopsided bob and they wanted me to wait nearly two days to have it fixed. Not to mention, the one doing the fixing was supposed to be the stylist who whacked my hair off in the first place. No thank you Lorraine. No client should have to wait two days to have hair their fixed especially considering I paid Lorraine $36.00 for a haircut and I left looking like a mess. The salon manager Erin stated she would not be giving me a refund because she 'can't' and the stylist Lorraine states she can't give a refund because it's 'store policy'. Someone is lying. To quote the salon webpage directly, ""Come experience Salon Lulu; we guarantee you'll be satisfied with your appearance"". I was utterly dissatisfied with the appearance of my haircut"". Their complete lack of customer service skills is a direct reflection of poor business practices. NEVER AGAIN",negative
"Jade is an excellent haircutter. Knows lots about world politics and will talk your ear off about it if you let her (LOL) but also has a sensitive touch. She's a great listener. And knows when to hold them and knows when to fold them. She does a perfect Updo if your ever in a pinch, and could color the Sasquatch camouflage (if you know what I mean) and basically, what I mean, is she's the total package. She does it all. Great cuts, great colors, great times....great Scott! Go see Jade.",positive
"I had my hair styled at Salon Mila twice in the past four months by Jennifer, and was very happy with it. In fact it was the best haircut I have had in several years. My only complaint was that the owner was a little overly assertive in recommending other services I was not interested in. This made the visit uncomfortable and in my opinion was out of line.",negative
"Amazing service! Most of the staff and the owner are always friendly and remember me, they're pretty talkative, not really my thing, but I can deal with it. Only exception is one of the older receptionist girls always seems to be in a foul mood, esp towards me. I use my time there to relax. I get a Shampoo and Style for around $55, the price has been changed on me 4x, 1 high, lowered, 1 higher, 1 higher again. Always around $50 - $65 at one point I believe. I'm told my hair is very easy to work with and it takes about 45min but the receptionist insists on charging me more than the average quote. I've always gotten a brow wax here, was very good, good shaping and didn't hurt. They're got some nice products and a great boutique, it's for older women with a lot of time and money to spend, their sizes are also slightly above average, a bit larger, the shoes are for small feet... I find it ridiculous over priced but ::NELLY:: is the best stylist ever! She can work with short, long, damaged, healthy, curly, wavy, straight... Black, White, Hispanic, Asian...whatever hair! She's very helpful with you maintaining your own hair and suggesting services or products that actually with work for you! She does amazing color and cutting as well. She's a very creative stylists with a lot of techniques (hair, nails, brow) under her belt, throw anything at her for wedding, prom, date night - she loves it! * * * Nelly no longer works here, think there was price increases/pay uses. * * *",positive
"A familiar story...my hair stylist moved; I needed to find another...went for cut and color. The color turned out close to what I wanted, the cut was incomplete, and out of proportion. I waited a few days to see if it would settle in; it didn't. Ready to try to cut it myself, and with a window of 2 hours, I searched again. Salon Mila came up! (Wishing it had come up sooner!!) I called, and Lillian had time for me, right then! That often doesn't happen, with someone good, but then, I was hopeful they don't overbook, so I could get a future appt. Lillian and I had a great discussion of what to do, very candid, and she didn't start until we were clear on the outcome, as the cut I had left her not much to work with. This is an Aveda Salon, another huge plus. Lillian cut my hair with precision, checking carefully all over for symmetry, and working to preserve length as well as give shape. She achieved the definition and movement in my hair that I wanted, and the cut complements my bone structure. I have gotten so many compliments, everywhere I go!! That has not happened in several years!! And, it's a couple of weeks since the cut, and it has washed and dried, and started to grow out, keeping the shape and movement, without fuss. I am SO HAPPY! You will love this salon, you will love Lillian, if you are looking for precision cutting and styling that is easy and carefree, and products that are healthy and beneficial. Going for color with her next time! Bottom line, I feel like 'myself', like I look the way I see myself, not a standard Scottsdale or trendy haircut. Lillian, please don't leave!!!!",positive
"My friend and I came here for her 50th birthday to get our hair and make up done and we couldn't have been more thrilled with the results! Marlene and Kasey were absolutely brilliant and they worked wonders with our hair. We told them what we were looking to have any they did it better than we could have even imagined. Unfortunately, I'm not from Scottsdale but if I was, these girls would be my preferred stylists! Thank you so much, Kasey and Marlene!",positive
I have been going to Salon Mila for 12 years. I will never go anywhere else. My hair always looks amazing when I leave. The color and cut are always perfect! I feel glamorous and beautiful when I leave. First class salon! Beautiful surroundings! Always great service! They aim to please! Mila knows what it takes to make sure her customers feel welcome all the time! Thanks everyone!,positive
"Extremely overpriced for the services.....I've had much better colors and cuts at Rolf's at Gainey Village in Scottsdale, which is a MUCH higher end salon with more contemporary, educated stylists, for less $$. Of course, you're going to pay more because this salon is associated with The Boulders but the quality of the services and the overall condition of the salon are kind of borderline old.",negative
"If you color your hair I highly recommend seeing Marci at Salon Mila. I was in AZ on a business trip and stopped in the Golden Door Spa to have my hair Colored and cut. Marci did an amazing job. My hair was over processed and too blond from highlighting for too many years. In just a short time so was able to add low lights, brighten my highlights and turn my hair back to it's normal natural state... I LOVE IT. Every time I stop by thru Phoenix I'll be in to see Marci (not to mention I live in NYC where the best salons usually are). Don't wait...go see her!",positive
"I have been looking for a nice place to have my nails done in Downtown Pgh for a long time. Finally, I've found it. Nina (who is warm, friendly and personable) fit me in at the last minute and had my old gel polish off and full manicure done in 45 minutes. And my nails look beautiful - probably the best manicure I've ever had. I almost never review anything, but this place is worth it.",positive
"Went to the salon since its close to where I work. Also wanted to see how the quality of work was. It. Was. Great....! Had a basic manicure with Nina. She was efficient, knowledgable, kind, conversive and welcoming. I will definitely be back soon!",positive
i must thank Carol and the staff at Salon Nuvo for taking care of me with my broken nail emergency during my stay at a hotel on the north shore! I really appreciate how they accommodated me!,positive
"I've always had haircuts that were just ""well, good enough; it's not a disaster."" Then I went into Salon Nuvo on a whim and had Marjorie cut my hair. You could tell that she knew what she was doing and had good command of different cutting and layering techniques, making my hair look excellent. Best haircut ever. For once I came out of a salon really loving my hair and the way that it looked. She even recommend a hair product which doesn't make my hair shiny but still has a firm hold. Definitely coming back. Couldn't recommend Marjorie more!",positive
"When I was back visiting Pittsburgh, I decided I wanted to get my hair done at the salon I loved when I lived there. Well, my normal girl, Autumn was not available, no big deal, they hooked me up with Megan. She was awesome! Really listened to what I wanted done-which was just a maintenance cut, little off the ends, and fix my layers since I wanted to keep my length. Conversation was free flowing and never once felt forced. She paid attention to what I said I was doing that night (going out to dinner for my anniversary) and asked if she could style my hair for the night. I was excited she offered and even more excited with the final results. I have very tick, long, wavy hair and Megan was not afraid to have fun with it, even if it took longer than some other clients may. I'm glad I was able to get while I was in town. Thanks again! :)",positive
"Do you ever have those moments when, if you don't get your hair cut THAT DAY you're going to lose your mind? For someone who gets a haircut about twice per year, those moments happen about once every six months; one of which was last week. In that moment, any loyalty I had to my regular Shadyside salon went out the window in favor on instant gratification downtown. After asking around the office and checking Yelp reviews, balanced against who was available within the hour, I ended up with Meg at Salon Nuvo. From start to finish neither of ever shut up - in a good way. She took her time and after the last bang was trimmed, I was feeling pretty satisfied. My only concern was over the length of one of the layers and my bangs. Meg advised me to live with it through the weekend and come back for any necessary touch-ups, which I did today. I basically told her, ""I'm not sure how to explain what I want, so let's just do something else."" She did. I liked it. I'm happy. I'll be back.",positive
Really nice and friendly people! Also good prices. We got pedicures and there was a big variety of colors to choose from. The Saran Wrap they wrap your toes in after was weird and uncomfortable and they could probably get nicer pedicure chairs but I'd come back!!,positive
The salon is so dirty we left before I let them cut me hair. The sanitizers were old and half full. The scissors and combs were a mess. http://www.wellbuzz.com/dr-oz-beauty/dr-oz-pedicure-bacterial-infections-dry-pedicure-haircut-ringworm/,negative
"I traveled to Pittsburgh for a wedding and needed someone to do my hair and makeup. I was originally looking for someone that would travel to my hotel but I stumbled on this salon and saw all the great reviews. The salon ended up being a block from the Renaissance Hotel so I went ahead and booked an appointment. I saw all the great reviews for Autumn so I tried booking her for a haircut, updo, and makeup. Unfortunately she was booked so I settled for hair and makeup. I went straight to the salon from the airport and arrived about 15 minutes late. Autumn seemed a little stand offish at first but she quickly warmed up. She went ahead and offered to do all three services for me, even though we both knew that meant she would have to stay late. She asked me for pictures of what I was looking for and executed them perfectly. I really liked that we chatted the whole time but she never stopped working. She was extremely efficient. The hairstyle was elegant and trendy at the same time. The haircut fixed my bangs that were growing out funnily. The makeup was enought that it was noticeable, but didn't make me look like a drag queen. She did use some drugstore brands which made me a little nervous at first but for $27 she made me look amazing. The makeup stayed on all night. I have had my hair and makeup done by MarioDedivanovic's assistant (Kim Kardashian's make up artist) and I was more pleased by Autumn's work.",positive
I went there for Brazilian blowout . After spending around 400 bucks including tip my hair have not changed at all . They look even worse . They re-did it again to try to fix them but nothing happened. I have no complains about my stylist. She was very nice to me and looking in details but their procedure and product did not work . When I showed them results after second time after a wash they juts said thanks for stopping by. I wasted my money :(,negative
"I've been going to this salon on and off for 10 years. While I was going to Salon Nuvo I had long, thick, wavy hair with short bangs. My whole life I've had issues with finding the right stylist because I have a ridiculous amount of hair. I found Autumn through reviews for people with curly hair and they were right..Autumn is seriously gifted at cutting curly/thick hair. In the time I went to Autumn I got constant compliments on my hair. My long, out of control hair was finally in control. I didn't even have to blow dry with the cuts she gave me, she managed to work with my natural hair type to make it lay perfectly. I can't say enough about how awesome she is. Unfortunately it is really difficult for me to get Downtown which is the only negative thing about this salon..I had to switch to a salon near my house and no matter how much I pay noone can even compare to Autumn. Hopefully after reading this review a few people will get to experience Autumn's awesomeness since I can't anymore :(.",positive
"I have been going to Salon Nuvo for about two years now. Autumn does my hair and she is amazing. I have very fine, thinning hair and the cut is always flattering. And Autumn seems quite supportive of my desire to not color my very grey hair, which is something I have not had in other salons ... there has always been a push to do some sort of coloring treatment.",positive
Salon Nuvo has a wonderful and comfortable atmosphere. The staff is very friendly and professional. Terry Boden has been doing my hair for 7 years and she is AMAZING!! She has never failed to give me what I asked for. I always leave the chair 100% happy with the style and service that I was given. She keeps my hair healthy and beautiful; I get compliments on it all the time!,positive
"I started getting my bitten nails done here. the nail lady, Carol, does a fantastic job. Started with tips and now I have my own nails. I was shocked that my nails did not get destroyed under this tips, which has happened anywhere else I have gone. There is only one nail person, so you have to come while she is there, but I have never had any problem getting appointments. She has even stayed late on occasion to get me in.",positive
"Everyone at Salon Nuvo is a professional. Everyone is friendly and it's a really great salon. Chrissy has done my hair for almost 15 years (she moved to Salon Nuvo about 2 years ago) and I trust no one else to perm or color my hair. Chrissy understands chemicals and how to maintain healthy hair. She's a dedicated professional and has always been flexible - she let's me come in late to accommodate my work/school schedule. And everyone I've ever referred to her has been a happy customer :-) I'm pretty brutal on my hair (lots of heat and don't deep condition as often as I should, in addition to a fair amount of every day stresses)....If Chrissy didn't maintain and take care of my hair, I'd probably be bald by now! She keeps it trimmed, healthy, and growing!!! And she's super sweet....it's a delight to sit in her chair :-)",positive
I have been getting my hair done by Terry Boden for a looonnnggg time and she is one of the 3 people I have let cut my hair in my entire life!! I even take my four year old daughter to her when I can and she is amazing with her!!! I am very picky about my hair but put all my trust in her and am I glad I did!!! The salon is nice and the other ladies are all professional. I grew up in Pittsburgh and moved due to the military but everytime I am in town to visit I find Terry so she can work her magic on my hair. She really is a jack of all trades and I LOVE what she does for me!! I recommend anyone to give her a try....no matter what hair type!! You wont be dissapointed!!,positive
"The highest praise that I can give SALON NUVO - and very specifically, Terry, the stylist who does my braids on a regular basis - is that I am constantly stopped by strangers who like my hair and want to know who works on it. Whenever I've gotten my hair re-braided, her handiwork usually gets complimented within minutes of me exiting the building. My friends and family remain fascinated by the new patterns she twists my hair into...and I'm a guy, so I like the attention! ;^) Terry typically twists my hair initially, then finishes them off as three-part braids, so that they will hold longer. I personally like this look, because it appears more ""full"", and yet still has some life to it.. She's so good, no one ever guesses that I'm gradually thinning on top, and versatile enough that we've switched this look up from time to time. In professional settings, my hair is always stylish enough to merit compliments, never so ""busy"" that people do double-takes. Terry is really phenomenal. I can't boast enough about her! Her coworker Chris was previously my stylist for many years, and even though she no longer does my hair (braiding is Terry's province), I would recommend her in a heartbeat. These two stylists are experts with all textures of hair, and I've recommended them both for years and continue to do so. So, if you think you can handle getting compliments as soon as you leave the hair salon, go to SALON NUVO and ask for Terry (or Chris). You'll definitely get more than your money's worth and schedule a return appointment!",positive
"I have curly hair. Big curls, not tight ones, but definitely ringlets that can become Shirley Temple hair if I let it. It's always very difficult to find a hair stylist. Even as a child I seemed to go from one bad cut to another, by one poorly trained (in non-kinky curly hair) stylist or another. For the past 12 years or so I had resigned to cutting my own hair: at least I could look bad for free. Then someone with curly hair recommended I see Autumn at Salon Nuvo, and I've been beautifully coiffed ever since. She listens as I explain three hairstyles at once that I want bits and pieces of but don't really know what I can pull off, and the end result always somehow makes sense and looks fantastic. She also styled my sister (wavy hair), best friend (long straight hair), and my hair and makeup for my wedding and let me tell you, we were babes. In fact, some friends of mine looked dashing that night as well and it turns out they also went to her for their stylings. Autumn is an artist who can really see the best of your features and works your hair to make it frame your face perfectly. And, as mentioned, if there is something that you don't think is quite right, she's always willing to make adjustments after-the-fact, which takes a lot of stress out of the fear of post-hair-change regret. The Salon is professional, well-rounded, friendly, and afforable.",positive
"Nice people & nice location. Very experienced, which means they can make good recommendations. I felt I was in good hands. Location is very pleasant. The shop is clean, well-kept and feels upscale. Definitely going back, and encourage you to try it out!",positive
"I have gotten four haircuts from Autumn so far and they are the best that I have had in Pittsburgh -- and, I think, anywhere! I cannot recommend her highly enough. She is pleasant and easy to talk to and gives fantastic and cool haircuts. Also: her prices are very reasonable. I also have it on good authority that she gives great men's haircuts as well.",positive
I called for an appointment and had my haircut with Lilly. She was able to cut my hair dry and gave me a beautiful layered look. The price is unbeatable as well!,positive
"Got my hair cut with highlights and low lights by Van. She is amazing. She juggles multiple clients at the same time. She's funny and entertaining while being amazingly talented. It was my first visit and I went based on reviews from Yelp. I've already scheduled my next appointment and can't wait to go back. I'll be bringing my entire family. She's extremely busy, so make sure you make an appointment. Even if there's a wait, it is well worth it. Highly recommend.",positive
"I am so pleased with the service at Sassy Salon. Not only is Van a great hairstylist, she is a lovely person. I went for a hair treatment that didn't work in my hair and when I told Van, she asked me to come in so she can look at my hair. She did the treatment again and carried on a conversation with me while she did it. She was super sweet and insisted I didn't pay. I will remain a loyal client.",positive
"LOVE LOVE LOVE meemee!! She's awesome! Although I've only been to her a few times, she's never messed up my hair! She's friendly, funny and definitely knows what she's doing! The price for a haircut is a little steep, but totally worth it! :)",positive
Ok so Lilly is amazing! She just fixed a bad haircut that i got somewhere else!! She knew exactly what i wanted and needed! My hair feels soft and looks great! Can't say enough good things about my experience here.,positive
The stylist was very nice. She listened to what I wanted. When I left the salon my hair was styled with curls in the cutest way it has ever been styled by a salon. The next morning when I straightened my hair like usual I saw all the flaws. I asked for an inverted bob and there was no definition of invert in my hair. My hair was just cut straight. I asked for layers in the back and my layers look horrible! I am so depress with my hair I have just been tying it up. I feel like she messed up my hair so she styled it the way she did so I wouldn't see her mistake. If you are looking for a high end salon this is not the place to go to unless you just want a simple straight haircut. They wouldn't be able to do an inverted bob for you.,negative
I am very happy that I finally found a salon I love. Lilly is very awesome and she's always willing to do your vision and will tell you that it's possible and give you suggestions as well. She did the best ombré I could ask for that I constantly get complimented for. People even ask me where I get my hair done and I always send them to Lilly. I have loved having her as my hair dresser as I feel like I can send her anything and she can do it. Love this place.,positive
"I have to start this review off by saying that I've been coming to sassy salon for, wow, two years now. MeeMee is my hair stylist and by far the best one I've ever had. (No exaggerations) Two years ago I had just moved to Charlotte and knew nothing about the area, I just knew I was in a desperate need of a hair cut. I am extremely picky about who cuts my hair, because frankly I'm a picky person and I always have something to complain about. I looked all over midtown, most places I needed an appointment, they were booked, or wanted to charge me $70+ for JUST the hair cut (no wash or style included). So i looked in the south park area and the same thing. Since I was new to Charlotte I didn't realize these were more of the expensive areas but when I googled hair salons they came up... I had given and went back home. Googled salons near me and Sassy Salon came up, I thought the name was cute but wasn't sold until I saw the reviews. MeeMee had the most pleasant reviews (and Van, the owner but they said she was almost always booked). I walked in and asked for MeeMee and was able to get my hair cut on the spot. I explained to her exactly how I wanted it and everything that had ever went wrong of course. I couldn't have been more pleased. I tell absolutely EVEYONE who compliments my hair to go to her. She recently dyed my hair (my first time ever) it was stunning. And six months later my color is still as amazing as ever. I get constant compliments on my hair and I always, always, always recommend her. The best part about it, I always look as if I've received a $100+ hair cut and style but the whole process of wash, cut and style only costs me $30 (plus tip, AWAYS TIP HAIR STYLISTS!!). That's right--$30!. Don't let the fact that Sassy Salon is on independence. The salon is always super clean, extremely modern and could fit in with the best in south park and midtown. It's worth the drive. Worth the money. Worth everything. I promise you will leave feeling amazing and be highly satisfied. After two years I continue to go, and this will forever be my salon.",positive
Meemee is amazing! The only hair stylist that has truly gotten my hair right. She completely understands how to work with Asian hair. She dyed my hair to a brown color and it looks so natural and beautiful. I highly recommend her :-),positive
"I have been going to Sassy Salon ever since they first opened. Van, is the owner of this salon and she always does great color on my hair. She knows how to color Asian hair very well. She is great and never puts pressure on her customers to buy hair product. Even when I haven't showed up for awhile, she still treats me like a customer. She is very knowlegeable on coloring and highligting hairs. I just went to get my hair color last Sat, and Van did a great job on my hair. I had color and highlights done on my hair. I am very pleased with the results as always. There is another stylist there called MeeMee and she also does great job on haircuts. I would strongly recommend Van or MeeMee to do your hair. The price is reasonable here. I love the scalp message there. With color and highlights it costed me 110 and if this is done at the Ballantyne salon it would cost be double this price.",positive
"Never before have I walked out of a hair cut and felt so good. My stylist, MeeMee really took her time to listen to exactly what I wanted and gave me a cut that made me feel like a whole new person. She also waxed my eyebrows. I'm very, very particular about how they are done, and she got it right the very first time! I have (finally) found the salon that I will go back to and become a regular client. Two thumbs way, way up!",positive
"I love sassy salon! It's very reasonably priced and they have amazing stylist. They are so gentle with my hair, it feels like I'm getting a scalp massage ! I will definitely be back!",positive
"Good Location, Great Deal, Awesome Service Amazing Stylist! I'm extremely picky with my hair dressers, I've used the same girl for years, and having recently moved to Charlotte from New Orleans- I was on a mission. After my scheduled appointment with another salon was cancelled, I decided to call Sassy Salon based on the great Yelp reviews. I was not disappointed! Van was very sweet and was able to take me right way. The salon was nice, clean, and the girls really makes you feel at home. I really had fun chatting with Van and Mimi! Though I just came in for a trim, Van consulted with me on what I wanted, and cut/styled my hair to blend well with my existing ombré. Very skilled artist in her craft! Rates are affordable and location is easy to get to from Uptown! I plan on returning to Sassy Salon for my next appointment!!! Thanks Ladies!!",positive
"Make sure you go to Mimi(I think that's her name?) for the hair-cut. I went last week and Mimi was busy so I had another girl cut my hair and it was nice for 15 minutes until I came home and had a closer look. I don't know what kind of style she was going for but it turned out to be HORRIBLE! My hair was LONG, down to my lower back and I specifically said that I wanted to keep it long and just wanted a trim. Lo and behold, my hair is now just past my mid-back a little.. meaning 4-5 inches were off!? I also wanted to keep the angled style and I have 2 huge chunks of hair that was cut straight across on each side towards the front of my face and then all of a sudden the back portion is like 6 inches longer? I thought angled hair-cuts are suppose to go down evenly (think a straight point A to point B line), not cut and inverted (imagine resembling the tetris T)?! And last but not least of my rant- I also specifically said I wanted to GROW out my long layers in the back (meaning DON'T touch them) and yet, about 4 inches were taken off! Ugh! Now I have to deal with this mess and hold my hair up in a pony-tail for at least 6 months for this sh*t to grow back. Nonetheless, I am VERY disappointed and extremely annoyed since I've only had nothing but great results from Mimi. Next time, I will just BOOK a hair appt with Mimi- no more walk-ins. On a side note, any yelpers recommend any remedies for faster hair growth?! yes, it's THAT bad and yes, I'm THAT desperate!!!!!!!!!!",negative
I went to this salon thanks to Yelp. I was very pleased with the service and with the prices. I have searched for years for a decent hair stylist and hit the jackpot with Ricky! Everyone in the salon is friendly and the place is upbeat even when they are busy. It was the first time I got exactly what I asked for. Ricky did an amazing job and actually listened to what I had to say. I wanted something low maintenance and he showed me a quick way to style the hair that I can actually replicate at home. They also handle all ethnicities of hair!,positive
"I would never go here again. I don't know who's worse Mimi or the owner. My cut was horribly uneven and my ombre was even worse. I had more color on one side than the other. It looked like bad highlights. I had to go somewhere else to have them fix the cut and I had to color my entire hair black which was ruff because I have a sensitive scalp, hence getting my hair ombre. Everything just got worse as days went along and when I called to speak to the manager she acted like she didn't care and was too busy. I'm not going back to someone who messed up my hair in the first place for them to possible make it worse. I gave them a shot based on reviews and apparently I was wrong. I would have just preferred my money back because they provided a service that I did not receive.",negative
"This is the BEST salon! Ive lived in Charlotte 9yrs and feel like Ive FINALLY found a stylist that hears what I want in a style/cut. Meemee is awesome, I highly recommend her. The salon is in a wonderful plaza that is conveniently off of 74. Thank you for helping me feel confident! The cut/style I got today was fabulous and my husband agrees that I look like a whole new woman.",positive
"I had my hair cut and colored by the same stylists since I was 12! Since I've moved to Charlotte, I've been on a search for new stylists that I can depend on that were friendly, detail oriented, and reasonably priced. The staff at Sassy Salon surpass my expectations everytime. Van and her staff are a lifesaver!",positive
"First off let me start with the fact that I am extremely picky when it comes to my hair, and my salon. Since I have moved here from Florida I have found it nearly impossible to find somewhere with a comfortable atmosphere, great service, and most importantly great skills. I would recommend this salon to any & every one. Vann did my hair and changed it from dark brown to an awesome deep red. I am so in love ! I will not be searching any longer for a hair salon after finding this place.",positive
"Busy location but worth the wait :) Van did amazing on my full foil highlights and I am a very happy girl, she is a blessing!! :) highly recommend this place. Comfortable, great prices and great people.",positive
"I thought that my hair had no hope before I came Sassy Salon. It had been dyed and fried one too many times. I am new to Charlotte and was told that this was the salon to go to. MeeMee was amazing!!! She knew exactly what I wanted.I had the whole works--cut, color, and highlights. My hair felt so healthy and the cut and color was beautiful. I have been getting compliments everywhere that I go. I am so lucky to have found Sassy Salon and my new favorite Hair stylist!!",positive
"Service is great, fast service even for walk-in, last but not the least Meemee is a great hair stylist. She cut my hair just the way I wanted it.",positive
"I'm the aformentioned ""buddy"" Chris M. referred to..been going here for about 9 months and have always got a great cut for a great price. My cut is relatively simple: a #2 guard buzz up around all sides and clipped on top but you'd be amazed how many bad haircuts I've gotten with this simple cut...Van is the best and spends time after the buzzing going back and clipping and shaping it out...my mom was a lifetime hairdresser so I can tell if someone goes the extra mile to make it look right and she always does..I forgot to post on here before but i did give a couple FB shouts about this hidden gem of a shop",positive
"I would have never walked into any place called ""Sassy"" if it wasn't for Yelp, so thanks! I decided to check it out because I was fed up with Sports clips. All the stylists seem to be Asian, my silver white Jew-fro caused quite a stir, LOL! There was no wait, Mimi gave me a great scissor cut and was fun to chat with, plus it was cheap, so what's there not to like?",positive
"This is a great place to get a haircut! I went for the first time yesterday on a buddy's recommendation and I was extraordinarily pleased with the entire experience. Van is quite lovely and made me feel as welcome as if I'd been a customer for years. Just thinking about chatting with her and her staff makes me smile -- they are just so kind, friendly, and utterly charming. She is a master of the clippers; her movements were deft and nimble, but with patient attention to detail. Considering my limited guidance was ""Kind of short in the back, but not as much off the top,"" I'd say she has a real talent for the craft. Van trimmed and balanced everything into exactly what my hair should look like. I really, really liked the results. But I really, really, REALLY liked the shampoo and head massage that followed. A great cut and then a relaxing head massage?!?! Unbeatable, and only $15. I'd go back right now if I hadn't just gotten a haircut. Give the Sassy Salon a try -- you'll be glad you did.",positive
"I came to Charlotte solo in spring of 2012, without knowing anyone or anything. I was desperately looking for a quality hair salon at the time. I thank my lucky stars that I found Sassy Salon. The first thing I noticed when I walked in was the welcoming ambiance. The interior design of the salon is very elegant and soothing. On top of that, the staff is super friendly and they know how to make you feel like ""family"". Moving on to the ""skills that pay the bills"", Van really knows how to cut men's hair with style and she does it quickly and effortlessly. Then they top it off with a shampoo and head massage that will leave you sleepy. Probably the best haircutting experience I've ever had. I was hooked from day one. To the whole crew at Sassy Salon, you guys rock!!",positive
"Van and Nancy...... I love you! This place is the ONLY I will let mess with my hair. After living all throughout the US, I had never found an establishment that consistently provided both good customer service and a great haircut. Then arrives Sassy Salon and after 1 year- i have yet to go anywhere else. Great service, great people with tremedous skill. They make you feel at home and are quite genuine about it. Friendly, efficient, clean and an overall awesome atmosphere.",positive
"A friend of mine recommended sassy salon to me about a month ago. Van did not disappoint. While I still have love for modern salon and spa, I like going to different places and trying different stylists from time to time. And it's always fun when you find a stylist that you are comfortable with. This salon is clean and nice on the inside. Van and her staff are friendly and have lots of personality. Cracking jokes, good conversation. It's a nice environment. But most of all, everyone who has gotten a cut or color there has been pleased. That's key. It doesn't hurt that it's very reasonably priced either! Just make sure to make a reservation!",positive
"I am not a girlie girl by the standards of most. I will run through a creek bare footed and pick up a frog with my bare hands. I'm not a fashionista, and I would say I'm not even really that cool. I mean, I am cool, but that nerdy type of artsy cool. So after that senseless ramble above, what's my point, right? Well, although I may not be the most trendy gal around, I do have a crazy obsession with my hair. I grow it out, cut it off, color it blonde, go back to brown, add red, highlights, color, layers etc. I can't get enough. Sassy Salon is a small little place in a strip mall that looks a bit deceiving as you drive by. I can honestly tell you, I would have never just wandered into this place by chance. I have NO idea how I even came across the place originally, but I can tell you why I go there now. I work for a company that makes us stay pretty conservative with our hair styles and color. Being an artsy fartsy type, I cannot stand that and I get bored pretty easily. A gal I work with came in with a cutting edge style and color that stuck out, even in a conservative work place, but was still considered acceptable. I asked her where she went, and Sassy Salon is the place she recommended. I drove over for the first time, and told Van what I wanted, or at least an idea of it. She saw the pictures that I wasn't allowed to do at work, and came up with the low key versions to still help me not feel plain. She and Song are so personable and friendly, and I enjoy going to get my hair done here. First, she listens to what you truly want, and my hair always looks great. Second... OH MY GOD, the scalp massage. It is AMAZINGGGGGGGG.... I wasn't even expecting that the first time I'd gone. When she took me over to the bowl to rinse my hair, this amazing relaxing massage started and I thought I was going to have to be carried out of the place from sheer relaxation. I'm just glad I didn't pass out and start drooling on myself. Wow... I'd go there and pay them JUST for the scalp massage!!! They do accept walk ins, but she is in high demand, so it's not always easy to get a walk in. I'd say to get an appointment, makes it easier on you and the salon. I always feel great when I leave, and the best part is the price. I usually get a highlight, low light, cut and scalp massage for around $80. I highly recommend this place, but if you drool all over yourself, then don't say I didn't warn you!! :)",positive
"This is such a great addition to the Super G plaza. Or at least that is what I am calling it. Sassy is owned by Van, a kind and very sassy stylist. I send my international students from Asia here for hair cuts, the guys and the gals. I just got a straight perm and trim here for $65, and she told me to drop by in between visits for free touch ups on my bangs since my hair grows back so quickly. You can't beat that.",positive
Sharlina is a total pro!! She has a passion for being a stylist and takes her time to learn what's important to you about your hair/look. She is very helpful in offering suggestions and she totally delivers on the look!,positive
Sharlina is an expert. Able to transform color to exactly what's desired and keep it looking natural and healthy. Love my hair! She is patient and veryyy detail oriented. And she takes the time to listen.,positive
I can not say enough about Sharlina! She is amazing! She made me feel like a new person! The color choice and style she suggested for me are perfect. She is so talented! I would recommend everyone to go to her - even if you have a hair stylist - just try her once and you will be won over!,positive
"Sharlina is hands down the best stylist I've ever visited (London, New York, Chicago, Detroit). I get compliments on my hair all the time - her balayage color is impeccable. Sitting in her chair always makes me feel pampered, and is guaranteed for a good laugh and chat.",positive
"I have never colored my hair before so I was taking a leap of faith and stepping out of my comfort zone. From the moment I met Sharlina, I knew I could trust her 100%. Her knowledge of coloring and cutting, along with her professionalism was beyond my expectations. She is so detail-oriented and does not let anything go missed. She takes her time to make sure everything is executed perfectlyZ She believes in her work and puts everything into it to make her clients happy. I received a cut, balayage and glaze on my hair and it turned out WAY better than I could imagine! I will definitely be coming back to Sharlina for all my coloring needs and recommending her to friends.",positive
"Sharlina is the best! She is always willing to discuss my latest hair change, while still focusing on the overall end goal and helping me articulate what I want. Sharlina is so friendly and she has a very cozy space. It took me awhile to find a new stylist when I moved here, and I'm so glad I met her!",positive
"Ben delivers good ol' fashion service! I had a wonderful mani & pedi. No nickel and diming...what you ask for you get, rather than trying to Upsell you on everything! I love this place!",positive
Absolutely AMAZING! Ben and his team are so wonderful and such great customer service. I love there work and i make the 20 minute drive to go to there shop when i have one right around the corner from me. I will keep on sending people to this location! :),positive
"I took the Saver's parking lot to the Pet Hotel & noticed a sandwich board that said salon, nails, massage, etc. Yes!! II needed to get my nails done today - I'll see if they do acrylics & take walk-ins. I got right in! Found out about all their services, got an acrylic mani/pedi, my legs. & facial hair waxed, it was greatnext time Im going to get a massage & try eyelash extensions. They are very nice, gentle, & did a fine job. Glad to find a reasonable nice place!",positive
"This is a new, gorgeous, clean full service salon. Nails, hair, lashes, laser, Botox, etc. Ben is the salon owner and absolutely amazing at nails. I broke a nail that was done in LA and he was able to color match my holographic nails with short notice and make me feel whole again! The customer service is exceptional and I will definitely be back for their nail and lash services!",positive
"This place is amazing!! We love to come in and spend quality time together. The staff are all very nice and polite and do good work. BEN, the owner, is awesome!! I recommend this business to anyone looking for any nail or spa or hair appointments!! They will open the new skin care salon at the end of October!!! FIRST CLASS SPA AND SERVICE!!!!!",positive
Customer service is great and the overall quality of their work is phenomenal. They have a good selection of products to choose from and have a coffee bar with snacks to enjoy while you wait. This is def. my new pampering spot!,positive
First timer: Ben the owner is a very interesting man and his wife Diem did exactly what I wanted to to repair my acrylic fingernails and two toenails. Will definitely return.,positive
"This was the most amazing nail salon visit I have ever experienced! Great place owned by a married couple and they just took over the business and revamped the place. Best gel nails I have ever gotten done and I've been trying to find a great nail place for 15 years! The treatment you get is top notch! I won't go anywhere else- they really take their time - it's not rushed at all, I love it! Also they are open on Sunday from 11-5 only nail place within distance that is open Sundays!",positive
"Wow, I wish I lived closer! On vacation, found this place on yelp and loved it!!!! The facility is very clean and professional. When we arrived we were greeted with a cold bottle of water, and sat quickly. I got the #1 pedicure and got a phenomenal foot/leg massage, great paint job and to top it off a neck and back massage. If I had more time I'd try out one of the massage rooms, they are beautiful. I highly recommend this place!",positive
"AMAZING PEDICURE!!! This is the best pedicure I've ever gotten, they even use a hot stone and really massage your legs (I almost fell asleep it was so relaxing:) definitely coming back!!! They just got new owners so that is why there is such a lack of reviews!(:",positive
"I will never go anywhere else again!! This salon is amazing! I was referred to them by a friend who raved about their services and pricing, so I went today after work to check it out. First of all, they have a grand opening promo special that is $15 dollars for a full spa pedicure, full set, or gel manicure. The pedicure was wonderful! They did such fantastic job, the massage was to die for and they gave me hot stones after the massage. I also got a full set from Diem and she did such an amazing job!!!! She did the exact shape I wanted and gave me a beautiful ombré with pink and sparkles. They couldn't have been more friendly and pleasant. My nails came out perfectly and the price can not be beat! Everyone needs to check this place out! They truly deserve the business. I got the full treatment and couldn't be more satisfied!",positive
"A fantastic full service salon. Under new ownership, this salon has a clean relaxing atmosphere. The prices are very competitive. My wife and I had a pedicure which was wonderful. They even painted our 4 year old daughters nails. We will definitely be back.",positive
"Great service! Their team of staff took good care of my mom, aunt, and I. It's nice going to a salon that cares about quality over quantity. They took their time to make sure all of our mani pedis were done to perfection. I will definitely will be coming back when I'm in town!",positive
"I came to this place for a Groupon Deal a Spa Pedicure and a Gel Manicure on Saturday. The staff was very friendly and welcoming. They are reasonably priced even without the Groupon Deals. However, when I got my pedicure and manicure the lady barley scribed my hands and my feet. Not only that, but my Gel Manicure began coming off! Even though she put three coats on my nails there was not enough time for the gel to be dried.",positive
"Very disappointed in my nails after a week, they were peeling after just four days. That has never happened to me with gel nails. My cuticles were not soaked and barley removed with something that looked like tweezers, and no cuticle remover was ever put on my toes or fingers. I hate that I paid for the Groupon, for what I have to show now. The woman who did my service was very nice though, per personality gets two stars as does the cleanliness of the shop.",negative
"I got a gel manicure and spa pedicure with Andi, and she did AMAZING! she did an ombré glitter on my fingers & absolutely nailed it. i purchased a Groupon originally but have gone back since and paid full price! totally worth it!",positive
"My original hair stylist quit and so I was scheduled an appointment with a different stylist. Which is fine. I show up to my 9:00am appointment and the stylist - Katie I think- hasn't showed up to work yet, the gentleman at the didn't desk calls her and says she is on her way and that she will be there in about 15-20 minutes and would comp my service due to the inconvenience. Very nice of him to do so. I show up 35 minutes later and the girl still isn't there. So I left and said I wouldn't be coming back. I feel bad for management, it was obvious they felt bad, but this appointment was scheduled for a week before my wedding. Super inconvenient and the last thing I need to worry about at this time. Wouldn't recommend this salon, what a joke.",negative
Katie is awesome. She did such a thorough job on my hair. I would totally keep going there if I wasn't moving. Gave me such great advice and was great to talk to. I got full highlights on red hair and turned out PERFECT. So grateful. Everyone else at this salon seemed very friendly as well :),positive
"Need More Stars! Whenever I am looking to find a new service provider, I look for a Groupon, right? I hit the Jackpot this time with Jennifer (Jen)!!! I have been growing my hair out from a pixie and was so sick of the ""in betweens."" I was ready to give up and chop it off but Jen convinced me to be patient and that I was almost through the rough part. She took out some of the bulk ( I have a TON of hair) and told me next appointment I should be where I need to be for the style I wanted. She didn't touch the length, just lightened the load a bit, lol.. It looked great and felt much better. 5 weeks later, I went again and got the best haircut of my life!! To my delight, she cut my hair dry, again, so that she could see how my crazy hairline grows and how to cut WITH the cowlicks so that I wouldn't have to fight them. The result was a haircut that literally falls into place AND it's so versatile that I can blow it straight or let it air dry wavy. Thank you, Jen. I am so glad I found you!",positive
"I came across this place via Groupon for a 90 minute massage. While looking at their website I noticed they had $40 hair cuts which I thought was pretty reasonable these days. So I decided to make an appt. To which they offered me a Groupon deal of $20! I'm always a little nervous going somewhere new to get my hair cut, especially since I wanted something more than just a trim. Katie was who I got and she was SO great! For one, it can always be a little awkward if the person can't hold a conversation. We chatted most the entire time and it wasn't awkward at all. I gave her an idea and showed a picture of what I wanted. She asked me hair related questions throughout (leaving me with longer layers since I have to wear mine up at work). I felt like she knew exactly what I wanted without me really having to say anything! I'm so happy to say I found someone who I will continue going back to! The receptionist at the front desk was also wonderful! Very attentive and kind.",positive
"I've had a great couple of haircuts with Brianna ..she is very friendly and pays attention to what you want, going to a new stylist can be stressful but she will put you at ease. I have loved my haircuts and will continue to go to her because of the attention to detail and great customer service! I gladly recommend Brianna to anyone looking for a great haircut!",positive
"What a great experience with all our services! Love my lashes by Amanda & massage by Tuan! My daughters hair for prom came out amazing with full highlights, cut and up-do...thank you Katie! Everyone was very professional and accommodating. We'll be back!",positive
"This is a hidden gem in Scottsdale. Let's be honest there really are a lot of places to go in the Scottsdale area, but very few that treat you like an old friend. Shona Salon & Spa is that rare exception. The staff is friendly and they were totally willing to accommodate me needing a haircut at the last minute. The salon itself is very clean..smells like a spa you would find at a ""fancy"" resort..and is well laid out. Bri did my haircut. She was VERY personable and asked a lot of questions, which I like. She made sure that I was happy every step of the way and the shampoo was AMAZING. I don't know about you, but that is always my favorite part. She made sure the water was just the right temperature, the products she used smelled GREAT and the massage of my scalp was so relaxing. After returning to her station she used more GREAT smelling product and styled me up. I got a peek at the spa side. Very quiet, relaxing and again the WONDERFUL smells. I also found out if you happen to book an appointment after 5pm you get a discount..so that's nice. Overall a GREAT experience. I would love to try the spa side of things to see how it compares to other places I have been. I know their prices are VERY reasonable..so that is also a draw. Definitely worth checking out!",positive
"They had a special where you buy a 100 dollar gift card for only 50 bucks, great deal. Even though they were super booked, they were able to get me in early on Saturday. Bri did my hair and she did an amazing job, my hair is super damaged and fine and she was still able to lighten it without frying my hair. She massaged my head while washing my hair, I almost fell asleep because it was so nice and relaxing. After she dried it, my hair looked and felt so healthy and soft. Bri even recommended products to me without being pushy about it. I ended up picking out something to help reduce the damage in my hair, it was 15 percent off products too! Even more off if you bought more than one. The bill wasn't bad at all, very reasonable for a high end salon. The two front desk ladies were very sweet and helpful too. Janet is one of them and she rocks! Will definitely be back :)",positive
I got my hair cut for the first time at Shona salon and spa 1/7/16 right when I walked in I was greeted by the nicest front desk lady Janet and was offered water while I had to fill out a paper which was great! She was so nice and friendly! Then I had Ashley D cut my hair very friendly and did a PERFECT job exactly what I imagined probably better! Completely satisfied and will Defiantly be back for other services! Highly recommend!,positive
"So found this great deal in Groupon and was excited to come for a massage! I booked a same day appointment which was nice because they had a cancellation. The spa area was really nice and relaxing so the setting is good despite being in a strip mall. The staff were friendly and helpful, the rooms were clean, hence the two stars. Now for the actual service.. My masseuse either did not know what he was doing it was totally checked out for that day because he didn't even try to work a single knot out of my back or shoulders (the two areas I asked specifically asked to focus on). It was like a back rub not a massage. Additionally, i asked him to make it warmer in the room, I don't think He did. Then when he briefly massaged my feet they were freezing, I said ""sorry my feet are cold"" hoping he'd get my hint, but instead he said ""oh that's okay"". Usually I would get a nice toasty blanket or something, but not today. Also I've had a lot of massages, but never did a masseuse actually pour oil directly onto my skin - I could literally feel the drops sliding down my arms haha I can't help but laugh at this point because what's a girl to do! The whole thing left a bit to be desired. Not sure if I got a bad masseuse or what but I don't think I'll be back. So disappointed!",negative
"Place: bright, big and clean! Staff: nice, friendly, clean lol Seriously a nice warm welcoming solan. The staff takes times to listen to your needs and wants and makes them happen. It's clean and greatly priced will definitely go there again and I can't wait to do so!",positive
"Really impressed with the new spa. Friendly staff and very easy to book an appointment with their masseuse Julie. Had the 90 minute deep tissue massage called the ""Stress Fix"". Definitely will be back again!",positive
"I tried Shona Spa for an afternoon of pampering with an Aveda Glow & Go Facial and a Rosemary Mint Awakening Body Wrap. Amanda was my aesthetician - so professional! I love that they have genuine Aveda products, they smell AMAZING! The Facial was excellent, but the Body Wrap - whoa - it made me the good kind of tingly all over, and if that wasn't enough they have this kind of shower with multiple heads that moves OVER YOU as you are lying down - a ton of warm water pours on top of you and rinses you off. I never experienced getting a shower lying down - it was super relaxing and luxurious. I can't wait to return!",positive
"The spa staff was amazing, :) they listened to me and were really flexible with my schedule. The pricing is way better than the other spa's i've been to in Scottsdale. Recently received a waxing service, hair cut and color. It was fast amazing! I'll definitely be going back!",positive
Gabby is amazing! I'm transitioning to my natural salt and pepper hair color and she's helping!! I'm so happy with my results! My hair looks great and I feel so much better about my journey with her helping me along the way. I've gotten so many compliments on how natural it looks.,positive
Going to get my hair cut by Gabby today. Can't wait! She always does an amazing job. I travel 80 miles round trip just to have her do my hair. Tells you how fantastic she is. The salon itself is so beautiful.,positive
"I'm a little particular of my hair and I trust the stylists here and they have a great location, cool decor and great people! I will continue to go here as long as I live here",positive
"I love this place! Relaxing, beautifully decorated décor throughout the building. The staff is very friendly and accommodating. Alexsis did my hair (shampoo, cut, and style), and she was phenomenal. She listened to what I wanted and made suggestions to create a great style for me. Definitely going back for my next cut. I highly recommend Solstice!",positive
"I was in a pinch for time and decided to take a chance on a newer stylist. Well lucky me!!! Paige at Solace Salon did an amazing job on my cut and highlights!!! She suggested that I go a little lighter and a little shorter than normal. I honestly feel like those two suggestions helped me look younger and I feel sassier. I really appreciate her attention to detail. I have a ton of fine baby hair and she made sure to get them, I have had a problem with that in the past. Anyway, love it and no one would know that I am not a natural blonde, I will definitely be back!!!",positive
"Casey was my aesthetician today - she is amazing; I didn't even have to think about whether I wanted to book a follow up appointment. And soonest. My services were: Pure Results Facial with the Get Carded Mini Eye Lift and Lymphatic Drainage Face Detox added on. I feel amazing, the price is reasonable and I felt instantly comfortable as soon as I walked in. Added bonus: while Casey was very informative about the products she used, and why, there was absolutely no pressure to purchase products at the end of the session. I will gladly consult her in the future for my skincare needs, though I felt relieved and appreciative there was no hard sell at the end.",positive
"They allow for you to make online appointments, which I find very convenient. A representative called me the next morning and scheduled me for the morning of December 31st. I saw Dana, who was excellent. I got an all over color and cut. She asked a lot of questions and made sure she knew what I wanted before doing anything. I really enjoyed talking with her as well. The two hours or so just flew by. I would definitely go to this salon again.",positive
"Need your hair cut? Go see the ladies at Solace. I usually see Elena and she is the BEST. I have followed her from salon to salon for years, and even while living in DC I would make a point to make an appointment with her when I was in the area. I have thick, coarse hair and she knows just what to do with it. She cuts the length wet and then styles it dry, so that she knows exactly how it will lay. Not only do you look like a million bucks when you walk out, but it even looks good as it grows out. Elena is an absolute perfectionist and takes time to make sure your hair is perfect. I have also seen Becky and she is fabulous too! She is very skilled and knew exactly how to work with my hair. Becky also dry finished my hair, which I feel makes a big difference for my hair type. I am very particular about my hair and I wholehearted recommend these ladies.",positive
A great product to purchase at solace for medium length to long hair .... sea salt spray from davines .... love love love this stuff,positive
So I bought the groupon for a massage for both my gf and myself and we called and made an appointment with them. This was my first time coming here by my gf has come here many times before. So for my first experience it was great! Everyone was polite and he massages were amazing it was a great day for both of us to just relax in the spa also I loved the waterfall showers We will be coming back soon for another great spa day,positive
I'm an athlete and love great massages. So couch this review knowing this. I asked for a sports massage and got a massage from someone who appeared to be a newbie. Pressure was so soft and you could tell her hands hadn't developed the necessary strength required for a deep massage. For $165 I had higher expectations. To make matters worse I was charged a 20% convenience fee before I even received the service. Since when is tipping 20% expected before a service?? What if the service sucks? I think expecting a tip is a very bad practice.,negative
The spa is wonderful. The decor is lovely and relaxing. Nina was a great esthetician. I had the Vitamin C facial with her and my skin looks and feels AMAZING! I had been on a road trip that ended in Vegas and my skin was felling not its best. When I walked out there I was glowing. She knew the right essential oils to use to calm my skin down. I was relaxed and felt great. The spa attendant was very sweet and took care of me well too. I will definitely be going back next time we are in town.,positive
So here's the deal.. Sunday-Thursday is 30% off for locals. It's not worth it full price! A spa pass is $45 for the day with no services. There is no discount on the spa pass so my way around it is get a $45 dollar manicure with the local discount it's $31.50 plus gratuity then hang out all day. At least u get a mani and spa pass for less than just the pass. My manicure sucked but my sisters turned out nice. The facility is nice and clean. I think I'd request who my sister got next time I come alone so then it would make it even better. Update: I was offered a redo manicure the day after I posted this! I requested Danielle because my sister went to her! I'm very pleased and added that 5th star for customer service and a great mani and conversation with Danielle:),positive
"I have to give mixed reviews about this place. First, the massage was amazing, although the woman had no personality. It was a great massage! I was irritated because when I left and went to take care of my bill, that is when the problems occurred. I had a gift certificate I received for a bday present. I have the receptionist my gift card- I was told my gift card was only worth--- amount . I told them my gift certificate stated good for one 80 minute massage. The woman preceded to tell me that they proves went up and now my gift certificate is not worth the entire amount if an 80 minute massage. Wth!? No where in the gift certificate did it state it wouldn't be worth the entire amount ever nor did it have an expiration date. Then they ended up put a 40$ service fee added on top... ended up paying $70 more on top of the gift certificate that was already over 120$. This was ridiculous and I will never return back to this establishment...ever! Beware- do not buy a gift certificate here ever!!!!",negative
I had a prenatal massage with Evelyn yesterday. It was my first prenatal massage. I was 21 weeks and I did not know what to expect. Evelyn was such a sweetheart! She's so soft spoken that sometimes it's hard to hear her but she's so polite and accommodating. She throughly explained the massage to me to make sure I knew exactly what to expect during this prenatal massage. She started off very gentle and didn't put much pressure on back. I had to ask for more pressure. I normally love deep tissue massages and hate Swedish massage because it's too soft. She was more than understanding and made adjustments as requested. She explained that most first time pregnant women are often afraid of too much pressure on their back/ belly so she always start off soft and adjust as needed. I had my massage on my side. I expected the typical donut type tables for the preggo belly but she explained that it was better to start on my side as this was my first prenatal massage. I'm glad I listened. The scalp and neck part of the massage was incredible! The massage itself was excellent! I felt so much better! So relaxing and my muscles feel much less tight. One thing worth mentioning was the lack of aroma therapy. Most spas smell amazing the minute you walk in. They usually had scented candles to set the mood for relaxation. I was expecting that but that wasn't the case here! It was really odd. It didn't have that spa smell during my visit and I kept thinking I should take deeper breaths to inhale the lavender scent but there was nothing there. Whomp whomp! The spa was very clean. The dressing room was spotless. There was someone there cleaning it at all times. The receptionist was super nice and friendly. I would def come again!,positive
"EXCELLENT SALON AND SPA SERVICES WIT DANIELLE AND KRISTIN Love the staff and services at Spa Aquae. My two favorite staff members are Danielle in the salon and Kristin in the spa. Have been going to Danielle for a couple years now and she does an amazing job with my cut, color and pedis. We hit it off as well from the start ... warm, friendly and incredibly knowledgeable. I'm a newer client of Kristin's and was instantly a fan. She's not only a wealth of knowledge about skin and nutrition but has such a kind and warm personality as well. I have had two custom facials done and my skin is evolving already. Both have done not only do such an excellent job with what but are just two amazing women that I look forward not only to being pampered by, but who enrich my life. As for the rest of the staff ... super helpful and friendly. The facility relaxing and clean. I highly recommend!!!",positive
"I absolutely loved our visit to Spa Aquae this weekend. The staff was amazing and impressed my mother and I with their customer service and professionalism. The spa was clean, very lavish and met all of our standards. I received the blueberry detox facial and loved my esthetician Kristen. Best facial I've received at a spa. Receiving a peel with extractions and not leaving the spa red was very impressive. With her massage techniques I was able to be so relaxed and have the firmest results. Thank you Kristen, I'm glowing. A very big thank you to the spa manager Dean for helping accommodate an appointment for me last minute and with my mother's appointment as well. We truly feel you went above and beyond. We can't wait to be back!",positive
"I was excited to be staying at this Marriott location and decided to take advantage of the spa for a couple of services during that time. I decided on a Quench Pedicure followed by a Coconut Sugar Glow (80 minute with massage). First impressions: I decided to head down about an hour or so before my treatments to enjoy the spa a bit beforehand. I checked in and was taken in to get my shoes and robe and place my things in a locker. I checked out the spa area and decided to read my book in the area near the cold/hot dunk pools. The fruit infused water they had on hand was very refreshing and I relaxed and read for a bit. Unfortunately the weekend I was in Vegas was the rainiest/coldest they had had in awhile so I did not get to try the pool area outside (though I really wanted to!) One thing I noticed that didn't go away, if anything was more noticeable, was that there was a stale smoke smell in the spa. The casino is right out the doors and obviously the ventilation system is not the best since it was apparent even within the confines of Spa Aquae. Pedicure: My pedicurist was very sweet and we had a lovely conversation. She wasn't as thorough with my feet as I would have liked, but they looked pretty when she was finished. One thing I did notice (and it ended up being a problem) is that they don't really have an area/equipment to stick your feet to dry the toes. She fanned at my toes with a set of salon flip flops but they weren't completely dry for my next treatment in 15 minutes. The problem came when I laid face down on the massage table, my big toes ended up getting smudged big time (which I didn't notice until I was getting redressed in the locker room). For the price, that was disappointing. Sugar Glow/Massage: This service was amazing and worth every penny. My skin felt so soft afterwards and the massage done at the end confirmed my new identity as butter. The facilities were dimly lit and the table comfortable. The shower that I had to use to rinse off the sugar could definitely use an update (broken tiles, etc). I would have this service completed again in the future as it was a nice alternative to a traditional massage. Overall experience: Am I happy I had some ""me"" time at the spa? Of course. Would I return to this location and pay the prices listed? (I had a discount with the group I was with): No. I would research and find another spa in town. The stale smoky smell that permeated the spa areas was also troublesome because let's face it, it's the last thing you want lingering in the air when you're trying to relax.",negative
"This place is a hidden gem! I was looking for a place to do some yoga classes here in Summerlin. They offer a deal where you can pay for six classes for $90. Since this was pretty good pricing, I decided to go. The big surprise was that you can use the spa amenities all day for that price! They have a gym, sauna, indoor heated pool, indoor hot tub, and a beautiful outdoor heated pool with spa jets. The yoga classes are held in a room with large windows overlooking the heated pool. They provide a robe, towels, water, and fresh fruit all free of charge. They also offer the other spot amenities make massages for an additional charge. This is definitely a great deal if you would like to take yoga classes, since most yoga places do not have the additional amenities.",positive
This update is way over due!! Last month I had my nails done by Brenda and she was so awesome and the only reason I'm giving 5 stars. Still disappointed that this spa doesn't offer a better color selection for the prices and still no glitter or fun things to add to nails. But Brenda was so sweet and very easy to converse with!,positive
"Most importantly VERY CLEAN SPA! Even after a bit of a flood this place is still one of the best spas in the country. Friendly staff, great amenities, very well managed. Very relaxing place to get away form the strip. Book treatments in advance as they tend to be busy on weekends. It is a great hotel property as well. Everyone I have encountered here right down to the valets are excellent. Thank you Mark for your help!",positive
"This is the second time I have been here and I have to say the second time was less than desirable. The first time was amazing, very attentive staff. The facility was in great shape. A few years later and this place is run down. The women's side showers were out of order, ALL OF THEM! we were escorted to a shower to use that was a quarter of the size of my hotel room shower up stairs, away from everything. Someone should really come in and renovate. Replace broken tiles, fix plumbing, etc. get this place back to where it should be.",negative
The first time I had a service at this spa I was underwhelmed. Half of the women's side is out of order or doesn't work well. Most of the areas are too bright and nosy. The whole thing is in desperate need of an update! I walked in and was greeted by four attendants who were all smashed behind an awkward table. I was taken to my locker that is not private in the slightest. The attendant walked me around to show me the facilities telling me certain things were broken. The place was virtually empty on a Sunday. Normally when I go to a spa the music is quieter and the lights are dimmed. Not here. The tiles are not straight and the grout is missing in many places throughout. The chairs are super uncomfortable and look like outdoor furniture. The steam room should just be called a warm room because there was almost no steam. I went outside and enjoyed the pool but noticed most of their 'water therapy' spots were broken. The grout in the pool and spa outside are missing. There are holes in the sides of the pool. The robe they give you is paper thin and not at all plush like most spa robes. If you get your feet wet and put them into the flip flops you will fall over. They called me back for my body wrap and I was taken to a very nice quiet comfortable room (what the rest of the facility should be like). The wrap was wonderful. I would go back if the rest of the facility wasn't so drab and old.,negative
"This spa was so relaxing, the staff takes care of you every step of the way. Everything was clean and smelled nice, from the changing area to the massage room. I got an 80 minutes sports massage, my masseuse found and destroyed all my knots and sore areas. The steam room was soothing and the sauna was clean and big. I would go again.",positive
Great adult spa. Services are top notch but it Is very $$$$... Gym is nice for a workout. Mens spa is clean and attendants are quick to serve. Price brings a 5* down to a 4* otherwise it's flawless,positive
"Massage and facial: four stars. Facilities: two stars. Overall rating: three stars. On the one hand, the technicians are wonderful and the services are really good, if not a little overpriced. On the other hand, the facilities are tired, in my view. I had treatments here about six years ago and the facilities sparkled. Today, I would say there is too much deferred maintenance including filthy plunge pools (e.g., cloudy with hair and band aids floating in them rather than Crystal clear water), moldy grout (mold in the desert!), and cracked tiles. It also doesn't help that the scent of cigarette smoke from the casino drifts into the upstairs relaxation/waiting room. If you want good bodywork or a facial from nice people, then go for it. But, at this time I do not recommend the facilities if you want a relaxing time in a comfortable environment; this isn't it.",negative
I paid for a 55 minute pedicure and it was only 45 minutes. I could have used the extra few minutes on my massage or calluses. To be honest the chop shop I go to does a better job for half the price. The ambiance is nice though. The salon has a clever way of automatically putting 20 percent towards their tip so if you don't believe your service is worth this much you have to tell them to make an adjustment.,negative
"This place like the entire hotel is in need of an update. Half the spa facilities are broken and usable like the hot tub, steam room and mineral baths. They had water and tea available but no hot water, the hot water cooler was broken. Service was nice and friendly.",negative
"First time here and first time at JW Marriott. Amazing first visit and I will be back. Friendly staff, super clean facility! I have been to many spas and this time I tried the desert stone massage. Sincerely I loved it way better than a Swedish massage! I fell in love! The waterfall showers are an experience itself. It wasn't busy which makes it more relaxing. There is a private pool outside the gym portion, steam rooms, saunas, an indoor pool and hot tub just in the woman's side. Honestly for the price, you must treat yourself to a desert stone massage.

"I really enjoy this spa and I love it even more when they are having the locals discount. I have tried many of the services, but my favorite is still the 55 minute Swedish massage and 55 min Desert facial. It is really nice in spring and summer to have lunch at the private spa pool. They offer healthy choices that are delicious. The spa outdoor pool is really nice with all the different out coves. They used to have a really nice selection of fruit and juices. This has gone downhill a little bit, but still a great place to go.",positive
"My hubby and I booked a couples massage for our last getaway before the baby comes. It was my hubby's first massage ever and now he is hooked. The women were very accomidating and professional! They have special pillows that allow for pregnant women to lay on their bellies for their massage and that was amazing! I was worried as to how relaxed I would get if I had to stay sitting up or just on my back the whole time. The indoor womens area was very clean and pretty quiet. The indoor pools are cool, lukewarm, and hot. The lukewarm is perfect for a good mommy to be soak as it isn't much warmer than room temp. Thier is a sauna, steam room, waterfall showers, and normal showers with soap, shampoo, conditioner and lotion in the stall. The only downside to this place is that if you are getting a couples treatment, there is no inside waiting area to be with your mate. The only places you can relax is at the private spa outdoor pool or the gym area. The only other place you meet is the waiting room for your treatment. I really wanted to be close to my hubby before our treatment where we could hang out and talk in a comfy area. not just the quiet room or super loud gym. The private pool outside was very nice, although the small pool was closed. Aromatherepy or hydrotherapy pool perhaps? The water was super cold and no one was in the pool. Was a bummer since being pregnant, I can't use the hot tub. There are no umbrellas for the afternoon sun.",positive
"The Hot Water Shower issue in the Men's Spa has Finally Been Addressed. Excellent Massages (Ask For Ron for an Amazing Deep Tissue Massage and Locals Discount if you are a Nevada Resident) Dated but Spotless Facilities, however for a $ 45.00 Entry fee do not expect a free Juice bar, Just water and Apples is All. The Hot Water was out for ages and I'm happy to report that you can finally get a Hot Shower. They still have second rate robes and towels when compared to the Qua Spa, however a Spa where there are never huge Crowds (I understand the East Coast Crowd keeps it busy from 6 - 9 AM) makes the place enjoyable. Still a High Price for a Good but not Superior Spa..",positive
"If this wasn't part of the Marriott, it would have 2 stars. But since I am a loyal Marriott customer and know they CAN offer an amazing spa experience, I bumped them up. However, I wouldn't say this one is ""awesome"". First, before we even arrived, I was a little unsure about the atmosphere based on all the pictures on the web. The photos looked more like America's Next Top Model Challenges, that just happened to be set in the spa. The ridiculous poses on the pedicure chairs and plenty of pictures of glamour shots of the girls didn't help me get a feel for the actual spa facilities. We stopped in anyways to hang out and schedule a couple of services - since our experience at other spa's have been amazing, we figured this was a safe bet. On my first visit in over the course of my stay, check-in was a touch painful and involved 2 people to complete: the one very helpful guy and the girl that just stared back at me from behind the desk. It was awkward. She then escorted me to the locker room. And that was were it ended. The locker room attendant proved to be a hit or miss deal - on this particular time she was behind the counter, but many other times during my multiple visits, the desk was empty. I received no real tour of the facilities except for standing in the middle of the room, pointing in the direction of things. I can only tell you for sure that they offer bathrooms, a hot tub and sauna. Those are all the things I found. The facility itself was clean and nice. The locker room is a shared space for getting naked, getting dressed, grooming and...eating? There is a kitchen in the middle of it - which does nothing for me. I think it is a little gross actually. They offer a gym which seemed to be pretty good except for the first 3 treadmills I tried didn't work. While a tad small, they do offer a private pool for the spa guests, which is much nicer than the family circus pool in the main area. However, it is by a walkway so that you are completely on display and with no umbrellas, there is no escaping the sun all day. One thing that stood out compared to other experience, was the lack of pool service. No one came by to take a drink order, clear away used towels or uneaten food, or even do a general picking up. Ii certainly didn't notice any leftover food and used towels lying about in the photos! This was the case throughout the 3 days we were at the spa. It definitely kills the ambiance - especially if you are paying for services or paid to just hang out. We also ran into a snafu and poor service when trying to order lunch. As for the services, I can't complain at all. You have to try pretty hard to make a massage terrible. And the facial was one of the best yet. So at least Aquae Sulis can deliver on the spa treatments...which they do well, so there is hope! They just need to spend less time on the glamour shots and more time on actually creating a glamorous experience. And getting rid of someone's unfinished lunch that has been sitting next to me all day.",negative
"My wonderful husband treated me to a spa day for my birthday and I was thrilled with the package that he selected for me. I started the day with a Coconut Cream Body Scrub and massage. Quinn performed my scrub and massage and it was wonderful. I prefer to have a male masseuse as women tend to overcompensate and rub too hard. Quinn did a great job and worked out all the knots in my back. Ahhh. Next, I had a Custom Concept facial. I hate that I can't remember the woman's name who performed this service, but she had an amazing Russian accent. My pores have never been so squeaky clean and the face and scalp massage was wonderful. After having been scrubbed, massaged, and polished, I headed down to the salon for a pedicure. I had the Paradise Pedicure and it was very nice. My toes look perfect and Jessica did a great job smoothing out all my rough edges. :) I received a full grand tour of the spa and did also use the gym which had a wide variety of machines and free weights. Everything was in good working order and I was very pleased with the service and the spa treatment. I would definitely go back!",positive
"The massage was wonderful but the check in to the spa is the real let down. As another reviewer noted, it was unprofessional. You go through two check-ins, yet they never give you a tour of the spa like other spas do. A quick walk through of the facilities would be appreciated for the amount of money you pay. I almost missed the waterfall showers but luckily I didn't. They were so unusual I used them twice. Nothing like heavy water falling on your aching muscles, pooling at your feet. Hubby booked me for a spa sampler, an 80 minute treatment of body, scalp and foot massage. I added on a facial. I'd give 5 stars alone to Mitch for the massage treatment. He was professional and courteous, providing the right amount of pressure and making me feel completely relaxed. I usually don't get a male massage therapist but in the future I'd want to clone him. The facial was OK. My skin gets super dry in the desert, so it was necessary but expensive. On par with other hotel spa services, but the facial felt standard, nothing special. The gym was spacious and quiet. They had an ample number of cardio machines and decent weights. I think they tack on an extra $25 or $35 fee if you are just using the gym without a spa treatment (not including waxing), the higher fee if you aren't a hotel guest. Definitely do yourself a favor and book a massage with Mitch, then give yourself at least 1.5 hours to work out and use the dry sauna, steam room, cold and warm pools, and those wonderful waterfall showers.",negative
"Is it possible to give zero stars? If so, I would. My friend and I had comped day passes to check out the spa, and decided if we liked it, we would stay and get a massage and pedicure. We left after 10 minutes. First of all, check in was completely unprofessional. The locker facility at my LVAC location is nicer than the women's changing room here. The outdoor hydrotherapy pool was closed, there were 2 bugs in the steam room, the showers out by the plunge pools were closed, and about 6 of the workout machines were out of order. We got of there quickly and decided to go to Red Rock next week, which is one of my favorites. I'll let you know how it goes, but ANYTHING would be better than Aquae Sulis.",negative
"Came here with my sister after a bachelorette party weekend. Our feet were abused, our bodies ravaged from late nights of dancing/walking/carrying intoxicated friends out of clubs... on top of that, work had also taken its toll. From what my sister told me, she said her massage was all sorts of amazing. For myself, let's just say i asked what my masseuse was doing the following day/week(can i take you home with me, please??) it was everything I hoped for it to be. My sister and i had a great time. We stayed in here for several hours, simply because we refused to leave... it was very tranquil and comfortable. I wouldn't mind making visits here a ritual. I definitely plan on dropping by whenever I'm in town.",positive
"I have been going to Aqua Sulis Spa for about a year now and have had my hair and nails done about 5 or 6 times. Every experience has been nothing short of fantastic. The service is always exceptional, i feel right at home, and have met some really great friends. I learned during my more recent visit that anytime one receives service they then receive an all day access to all the amenities the spa has to offer. (this includes gym, pool, spa, sauna, steam room, showers) my girlfriend and i spent a good 3 hours working out, relaxing by the pool, taking a dip when the 110 degree weather got a little too unbearable, enjoyed the steam room, as well as the sauna, and even used the shower which included shampoo, conditioner, shower gel, and shaving cream. to use the gym, pool, etc costs one $20 a day. a membership is $150 a month. i am seriously considering purchasing a membership, as everything that i need to get in a great workout is there and it is 10x's nicer and enjoyable than a 24 hour fitness or LVAC.",positive
"I've been to this spa multiple times and have throughly enjoyed the experience. The facilities are very nice w/ fresh fruit, juices, and water to enjoy as you please. Television w/ couches and magazines to relax. Cold towels w/ fresh slices of cucumber await outside the steam rooms. Cold and Hot dip jacuzzi's. Co-ed workout and outdoor pool area. The staff is also very attentive and keeps everything in order. The one downside about this place is the fact you have to walk through a very loud casino to get to it.",positive
Johnna is an amazing masseuse! She is very concerned about providing you a massage you are happy with. She asks if the pressure is good and she is very professional. One of the best massages I have ever had. I would definitely recommend Johnna!,positive
"I went to Spa in the Hollow for a Brazilian wax. The first time I ever got a wax I went to Capristo Salon. Spa in the Hollow was definitely not up to the caliber of Capristo. The towels that were on the table I laid on we're severly stained. They looked like they had been washed but because the towels were white you could still see old stains. It was pretty gross looking. Patty was really nice. She was pleasant throughout the appointment and made me feel comfortable. The waxing job wasn't horrible, but it wasn't great either. I still have multiple stray hairs and I've been dealing with wax residue all day. There are so may stray hairs, I'll probably have to go over it with a razor. The only reason I would go back is because you can't really beat the groupon price. At Capristo you'll pay $70 for the same thing. If you can afford Capristo, it's most definitely a better experience, but if you're strapped for cash Spa in the Hollow will get most of the job done.",negative
I think Lisa gives the best facial in the area! Extermly knowledgeable and helpful. Beth the lady on the desk is the most professional and sweetest lady! I would go back for services.,positive
"A really nice, well maintained day spa. They offer basically everything and my first experience here was a pre-natal massage. HEAVENLY. My husband also got a massage at the same time and said he's never felt better afterwards. Every massage he has had since then (it's been a year...kinda late on this review) has paled in comparison and he still talks about this place. The brazilians are also quick and she makes them bearable by distracting you with conversation and humor. The first time I came here I missed the entrance, so just slow down and watch out for it.",positive
"Had a pedicure here today and the pedicure itself was good and the lady who preformed the service was very nice and conscientious. Here's my issue... The spa itself is in drastic need of a makeover. Lavender walls, peeling wall paper, an occasional black ant on the floor. I don't know the atmosphere reminded me of old school Pittsburgh. Honestly, it was kinda a turnoff. I probably won't be back.",negative
"Husband came here for a haircut, and said it was the best service he's ever received. I later referred my boss when she was in search for a new haircut location for her son, and her son refuses to go anywhere else now! Andi is phenomenal, and her team is as well! I come in for products and they are all knowledgeable on what they all offer and what is the best product for any circumstance. I recommend this place like it's my side job to everyone I meet.",positive
"I have been here two times before and my experiences were quite good, until few days ago i went in again and had a nightmare. I did my hair with this specific stylist before (couldn't remember her name) but she is not there when i visited. So i made a decision that will probably make my regret for a month, i chose the first available stylist. I dont know if she just started this career or whatever, she did not seem to know how to cut one's hair. All she can do is using the cutter and adaptors with different hair length settings. And no, i do not think she can use a pair of scissors. I wanted a round shaped top, yet since she was using a cutter with adaptor of the same length, my hair came out to be square shaped! Sorry i forgot to mention, she did use the scissors, but what i got on top of my head is something you will find after your dog bites it. All in all, i'm not saying all stylists here are like her, but be careful who is doing you hair. Just a friendly reminder guys.",negative
The girls are very nice! Maddie is my favorite and love the MVP! I think that it it the best value and definitely worth it with the steam towels and massage. Their products they use are also very good and smell great.,positive
"To start with I never would have considered such a place for a hair cut as I have always been a customer for traditional male barbers. I was given a free coupon. Much to my delite, they honored it completely with no pressure, no upsales, no extra fees. 100% actually free. I thought it was an excellent, relaxing experience. Im picky about my man look. I requested a small list of special needs. The stylist, Anna, listened carefully and executed perfectly the hair cut i wanted. I was quite pleased and would highly recommend this business and herself personally to anyone. Great job Anna!",positive
"I've been in here 3 times and had 3 separate stylists. Each one does a fantastic job and will work with you in every way they can to make sure your haircut is perfect. The staff is friendly and personable. I've been to Great Clips, Master-Cuts, and BoRicks, and this is the ONLY place that has done a good job for the price. I highly recommend them to men and women like myself who like to keep their hair on the shorter side. I also like how they don't try and shove products down your throat or try and gussy up your hair to give off the illusion that it looks well cut when it isn't. They do it right the first time and are more than willing to make sure it looks clean and well presented. Thanks Ladies!! :)",positive
AJ rocks. I love SportClips. Every month it's a new adventure of fun and hair care. Everything about these folks is first class. I highly recommend. His should have been for the Old Farm Shop location on Kirby so go there as the location on Neil is not as good.,positive
"I do not even trust this place to fix the abomination on my head. They rubbed all sorts of shit products they were hard selling into my hair, and despite giving them the exact same description of what I wanted that I've given to Supercuts for years, I've never in my life looked more like a douche bag. It took all of 5 minutes of driving away before the Nevada summer sun dried my hair enough to see this bloody abortion on my scalp. I would rather shave bald than continue with this nightmare. I will be paying the $17 to visit mothersucking Supercuts, the walmart of hair cutting to fix this garbage. Just in case it's not the place and just the barber, don't bother with the hour wait for Ashlea. I have a fistful of cards to give my friends free haircuts, in case I ever want to lose my friends. Nope nope nope nope nope! And the only way to even get in the wait list is putting in your phone number, so I look fucking forward to obnoxious calls and texts requesting my business in 4 weeks ""to keep my style"". The word style used 3 or 4 times. I cannot stress this enough, this lowrent excuse for a building could be replaced by a flowbee operated by yourself while drunk and in a room with no mirrors. Fuck sports clips.",negative
"My son decided that it was time to stop rocking his Slip Knot locks and join the ranks of his new hero Harrison Ford, under one condition. That condition is his hair cut must be done professionally. I heard about this location and they had the Golden Knights game and playing too. We went in and signed in on the computer there is not a human to sign the customer in; so score one for technology. The store was very neat and had a huge flat screen with the Knights game playing too. When he was called she asked if we had ever been here prior and informed me that since we are new that he gets his hair washed for free. Yeah. The stylist looked at the image of Mr Ford on the phone and went to work. I waited for Connor in the waiting area and wow what a transformation from long hair rocker to sophisticated gentleman. Not that the rocker look is out it is not for him anymore. The stylist was so professional and gentle too. She was very quick and had such a pleasant attitude. She paid great attention to detail on how he wanted the back area of his hair. She took direction very well too on making sure the new length that Connor wanted. She was very skilled with the scissors and razor. He could not of been happier with his new look.",positive

"My husband has been here twice and he's not pleased, last time they messed it up where they had to fix an cut more hair then he asked.",negative
This change of my review is solely on one stylist that intervened with my last visit at this barber shop! I'm not sure what her name is but she's short and has blonde hair and works at the front station to the left! This same stylist cut my son's hair when he use to shave it bald and she left a bunch of long hairs all over his whole head that I had to trim with my clippers when I got home! So the next time we came in he had let his hair growth out and wanted a gentleman cut and it was done amazingly by another stylist in a station to the right with long black hair! So this go round I spoke with her and she told me she would cut my son's hair after the client she was working on! Then the blonde chick who messed my son's hair up last time came and called my son's name and I told her that we were waiting for the other girl and she told me that the other girl was to busy and that she was the only one available! So I expressed to her that she did not do a good job last time she cut my son's hair so to please make sure that she does a good job and she ensured me that she would! To say the least when we got home we were very unsatisfied and here are some images to show why! I'm no expert in the hair business but I know this is not how you fade a haircut! A fade means that you can't see a hairline all the way around your head as if you had a bowl cut!,negative
"I took my 2 year old here for a haircut. The cut looks great, but he was not thrilled about the experience. He's been getting regular haircuts by two other stylists since he was 10 months old. He's not new to the haircut experience. I took him in walk-in style as I was assured on the phone little ones and boys was their specialty. The stylist insisted that he sit alone on the chair even after he made it very clear it was not going to happen. After she compromised, she began by very abrasively spaying him down, and myself, with the spray bottle. She then abrasively told my two year old he needed to stay still. I considered leaving then, but I thought I'd see how my son handled it all. She continued to be abrasive with my little one, but he seemed to take it in stride. Like I said, his hair looks great, but I'm not sure if he's going to let me take him back as his words to me upon leaving were, ""no haircut momma""",negative
"I'm from out of town, been on the road for a month needed a hair cut. Read reviews on Yelp and someone recommend Kobe to cut hair. Was not disappointed . She did an excellent job. She doesn't work weekends. But if in town would go back to her!!!!",positive
"Kobe F is the best stylist I've ever had cut my hair, period. Went about 3 on a Thursday, so no wait. She asked what I wanted! (I've had stylists pick up a comb and scissors before they've said ""Hi"") My head is loaded with cowlicks - think Alfalfa but in weird spots, so I'm growing it out ( again, after a hipster barber in the Chicago 'burbs tried to make me look like I stepped out of 1939). All I asked for was a trim - and that's all I got! My beard had been cut (and not cut) in all the wrong places last time (see above) so I wanted to switch to chin straps blended with a long goatee to hide the fact that my cheeks are sliding off my cheekbones. She free-handed the clippers to shape me up. Quite simply, Kobe made me look awesome! And she recommended a beard oil that really softened my beard. I liked the haircut & beard work so well, I bought It!",positive
This place blows. A short blonde with big lips messed up my boyfriends hair so bad. He asked for some extra gel and she was a snob about it. I think maybe she forgot that were paying her for our service. Not the other way around. Learn manners.,negative
"I don't like the attitude of the people working here. We came in Saturday around 12 to get my boyfriend a hair cut. They were understandably busy and said it would be a 30-40 minute wait. No problem. He signed in and then we went to some of the surrounding stores to pass the time. When we came back 20ish minutes later and asked how long, they said 25-30 more minutes. They were pretty rude about it too. We left and decided not to come back.",negative
"Excellent option for the sports fan to stay occupied and makes the experience more enjoyable. Love the MVP - scalp massage, hot towels, shoulder massage and affordable. Better yet I don't need an appointment since time is usually the issue. However, every hair cut comes down to the person doing it. I have had some great ones here and some that they might have needed a little more mentoring. If you find a person you like that gives you consistent results that could be good. However, I do notice some turnover which is normal at other locations as well. Parking is also a pain. Go early in the morning!",positive
Its cool and all but this girl didn't really trim around my ear well at all ... and I'm not one much to complain ... :'/ Won't be back becase of this ... I did better job cutting my own hair ... sad truth .... feel some what jipped ... But nice concept. .. on there vibe ...,negative
"I have been going to this place for a few years now. Very nice staff, clean place, the options are nice. It is good to have a more masculine place to get a hair cut that is not a 100 year old barber. Only reason it is not a 5 is because there is often a wait and the parking lot is not great (especially now that Panera is taking 2 of their 4 only spots up front) To Joel: Put a shirt on man! This is the Internet!",positive
So I waited 20 minutes for a cut with only a couple people ahead of me. At the 20 min mark myself and approximate 4 or 5 others waiting for a cut . Staff was fast to tell people coming in that it's a half hour wait. They were friendly but taking too much time explaining hair products to people and trying to sell the products when they had customers waiting . I probably use them again in a pinch only because they take cards and not cash only.,negative
This is my first time here and I had Christina who is the manager for my stylist. She i awesome at engaging in conversation and such a joy to be around and compared to all the other hair places I go to this place is beyond worth it!!! Thank you guys so much for such an awesome experience. You've earned a new client!,positive
I tried this place out when I moved out here to henderson because I didn't want to travel far to go to my previous shop. First off they don't do razor fades or use a razor for anything at all. The only thing they can offer is a double zero. The ladies were nice and the VIP service is good. But they over charge for the type of haircuts they give.,negative
Just went to sports clips for the first time it was awesome head and shoulder massage Kobe was great! if you haven't been to a sports clip it's a great place to go comfortable atmosphere for a man and sports playing more could you want. Never had a hairstylist spent so much time trim in my ears neckline around my ears it's a true manicure of the the head!! Is Arnold would say I'll be back,positive
Today was my first experience having my hair cut here and I must say not only are the ladies beautiful but they do a great job. Thank you Barbie,positive
"0 stars if I could, sheenas did my boy dirty and nicked his head out of control, look at the photos to confirm. This place should shut its doors after how low they did my boy.",negative
We started going to Kobe for over a year. She cuts my husband and two boys hair. She is the best at the location by far.,positive
"My little sister been bringing her son's to this place for past 6 months, and now her husband is raving about one of the stylist. Good grief, can this place be really this good? Well, my hair was starting to look like drummer from a 1980's heavy metal band, and I had no time today to get to my regular stylist, so I finally took a chance with this place. Unfortunately, the person I was told to see wasn't there, but this mop top had get chopped, so gave them my name, and said it is my first time here. They were a little busy, but they told me it will be a 15 minutes wait. No biggie, because the place is set up for a guy, and all the flat screens are tuned in to ESPN. Sadly, ESPN was only talking about the Manti Teo hoax, so I ran out of there to Costco, and came back in 15 minutes. Guess what, they kept their word, and I walked right into the barber chair, and there was a couple of guys waiting on the benches. I was told to ask for kobi, but she wasn't there today, so I got a new stylist named Rogene. I was a little baffled about her name at first, but what the heck, she had a cool haircut herself, and told her to do something with that mess on my head. Since it's the wintertime, I'll usually let the stylist do what they want, because I need more hair because it cold, but at the same time I'm watching how a new stylist will do my hair. Rogene was very quick, detailed, and did one heck of a job! I didn't do the neck massage, but their tea tree oil shampoo was one of the best I tried, and the hair wax at the end was a great final touch. Did my little sister advice come through for me, yup.....I almost forgot, I get a complimentary neck shave in the next two week. Darn it, they might trap me from going back to my favorite place because of that. Great job Sport Clips.",positive
"I drive past another Sports Clips to go to this one and it's worth it. Everyone is always friendly, the lines aren't too bad and the store is always clean. Ask for Kellie. She is the best. I am sure the other girls are very good, but Kellie is awesome.",positive
"After doing the movies and the mall I had to stop and get a script which was right next door to this place so I asked my bf if he wanted to try them out. We came in and it seemed like a cool place, clean and well lit etc. I personally thought the girl that took our info was super bitchy and rude but aside that he said it was ok (which is what the 3 stars is for, had it been me...1 star for sure, I mean this chick asks us for my bf's name 3x so she can enter it into the system (after we tell her we've never been there AND asked their prices) before she will even tell us a price?! Wtf! So yeah, nothing to write home about. He also noted they are NOT a barber shop....they can't shape or line him up the way he wanted so yeah...keep your hot towel and shitty service and I will keep my money. Update: 7/27/2010 - Star rating is now at a 1 (was at a 3). So he decided to go back (it was close and he didn't want to wait to go to his regular place) and again, horrible service - this time we waited 35min before they called the guy who came in 20min after us and then we are sitting there while the ""ladies"" that work their figure out who's name they got wrong....finally he gets his cut ane he said he does NOT like that place and is never going back - period.",negative
I love the Triple Play! A hot towel on your face and a quick scalp massage after your cut. Makes my bald pate happy and shiny!,positive
"Horrible, no appointment allowed but u only have 2 people working on a friday? Not the 1st time either but it is the last.",negative
Thank you Indigo for doing such an amazing job with our 3yr old. She was very patient and talked to my son through the whole process made him feel so comfortable so he was able to sit still the whole time. A usual 1 half hr process only took 20min with her.,positive
It was great going in to sports clips and having to listen to Jennifer snap her gum for a solid 30 minutes while in the waiting area!! (Sarcastic) So unprofessional as a hairdresser representing Sportsclips!,negative
It was a late Saturday there were two stylists on duty. Nobody at the front desk and I walked in and sat down. One yelled out to me to sign in and have a seat. The guy in the chair was getting a VIP so I imagine they couldnt stop to assist a new customer. After 25 mins (they must of been a really special VIP) I was seated told them what I wanted. They said they understood and started quickly. Im no stylist but it felt like they were hurrying. My hair looked like it as well. When she finally stopped. I said thank you but could we actually try this again and slow down the scissors as they arent evenly trimming the hair. She changed scissors and took some more off at a good slow pace and my hair turned out fairly good. I know we are out west and our sporting options are limited in the evening but every TV had NASCAR. If they had sprung for a sports package I was listening to Baseball on my phone in the Lobby and would have prefered to watch that than the roundie rounders. I like this franchise in Omaha but not a good overall experience here in Vegas.,negative
"This is my first time to this Sport Clips, and let me tell you for a $22 it is top notch, $22 gets you a cut, shampoo and condition, steam towel for your face and a light neck massage, it was my first time so for the basic haircut i originally wanted, i got the M.V.P. which is what its called for free. And also it is more guy oriented with a big tv in the waiting area and tv in the cutting room as well.",positive
"I walked in and no one was there; rather, she was off outside and came in angry. It was a Saturday, so there was plenty of college games on; the only good thing in a sea of bad times. My stylist just sort of glared at me when I said I needed a quarter-inch trim, then proceeded to work in silence while I watched a Florida game. Which was good. I then ended up looking like a balding six-year-old. Not good. I paid my $17 (she sold the MVP in the way a person would try to advertise cholera, I avoided it) and got out. At least my hair's regrowing...",negative
"This is more of a 3.5 star rating but I'll boost it to 4 since I'm in a good mood. Despite popular belief(probably due to the 5 year old photo), I actually do cut my hair occasionally (whenever I don't buzzcut it). The problem with me is that I am picky when it comes to finding a good hair salon since I visit them so infrequently. I always irk at the thought of going to the same ole Supercuts on rainbow near Cheyanne and having to wait 20-40 minutes every single time I go there (twice in over a year) so I took it upon myself to shell out about $20 for a haircut and figured Sports Clips was decent enough, especially since if I was to wait 20 minutes before I could get my hair cut, I might as well be watching sports as opposed to pretending to be busy texting on my cell phone in public if I were at some other hair salon. Either way I arrive at Sport Clips with a 3-5 minute wait as the hairdresser was finishing up a patient and I was soon getting my hair worked on. Normally my hair when grown is a warzone and extremely uneven, I told the hairdresser to trim up the sides and back with a blend on the top. She did a pretty good job. And as a bonus for going their for the first time, they gave me the MVP treatment for free. It's certainly nothing like a VIP treatment at some other establishments out in Las Vegas, but I really do appreciate the hot towel over the head, nice neck rub/massage/shampoo (normally $5 extra). When it was all said and done I was pretty much looked the the aspiring wannabe hipster I set out to be. Overall, I had a decent experience, mid-day Saturday visit with no wait, paid about $20 for a pretty good haircut, no complaints, decently solid in my opinion.",positive
"Got a flyer in the mail for this place, and heard about it from a friend, too. It just opened a month ago, so I thought I'd give it a try with their coupon. Normal haircut is usually $17, MVP haircut (more on this later) is $22. My coupon was $12 for an MVP cut, so definitely a price break from the $39 I pay at American Male across the street. No appointments was a like and a dislike. Liked being spontaneous and going in when I had time, but didn't like waiting. Lots of sports on TV, which is their thing but isn't mine. Definitely not as fancy as American Male or other salons, but good for the price. MVP haircut included a hot towel, massaging chair and scalp massage. It was all OK, but nothing amazing. It made me miss the treatment I'm used to across the street. Sheesh, I think American Male has ruined me for every other hair salon. I'll probably end up spending the extra bucks. But if you want to save money, Sport Clips is perfectly acceptable. Think of it as a bit higher end Supercuts without quite going to salon prices.",negative
This company wants you to put yourself and others in danger by only check-in online while driving. They refused to take a call ahead appt and told me to 'do it online'. While I clearly explained to them I was driving.,negative
"It was so sad to get a hair cut there. My hair get really bad shape, and the lady that she cut my hair she not friendly ( rude ), she very rush on my hair, I got my hair done only (10mn). I'm really disappointed to get my hair cut there. I won't go there anymore for sure.",negative
"Been at the hospital with my father for the last couple days. Finally have time to get my hair cut so I drop by the store closest to me. I rush over there and the door is locked 10 minutes early! Manager is on her phone and shouts they are closed. I call back asking why they were closed early, she says rudely that they have plans and a life on a Friday night and want to go out. It had been dead all day she says...well I hope Kevin the owner had the same opinion about turning away customers. I was going to tip 20 bucks too for keeping them late. Plenty of other places to go in the future.",negative

"SportClips Haircuts: Guys watch sports! Guys get haircuts! What a an experience! SportClips offers inexpensive men's haircuts with options! Just $16 for a men's haircut and wash AFTER (great so you don't have little hairs everywhere for the rest of the day). You also have the option of doing a shoulder massage - heaven! Meanwhile, you are in a cool place with sports decor everywhere, and TVs playing the sports you like. The employees definitely know sports, and in my case, Deana was nice, friendly, and gave me the perfect cut. This place reminds me of the old-style barbers of the 1940s & 50s, who cut your hair while you and the other guys talk about guy things - like sports! In this day and age, there are plenty of salons for women. Why do guys need to sit there and get their haircut in an atmosphere they feel uncomfortable in? This is a modern-style, friendly, sporty place with great services and low prices! Three Madison locations: Corner of PD & Verona Rd, Deming Way in Middleton, and Gammon Rd near Woodman's. I'll definitely be coming back (after all, I got a coupon for $5 off my next haircut, $4 off the following one, and so on, down to $2, which I believe all new clients get)!",positive
"This is a professional hairstylist. His style resembles slightly of an asian hairstyle, and although I'm caucasian, I get even more than I want. My hair is proportionally trimmed, I get the rectangular line on my neck, hair is washed well, scalp massaged. My head looks well. While working on the hair, he's a great companion for a chat. I'm a frequent client.",positive
"Haircuts have always been a bother for me. I can never find a stylist that I like but I can confidently say I am happy with my hair cut. Taro was very personable and gave me a lot of attention. I suppose my only con is price, the price was very reasonable but slightly higher than other asian hair salons in the area.",positive
"Taro is probably one of the most experienced hair stylist that I've ever met. I brought a couple of pictures with me to show him the styles that possibly suits me. And then we had a discussion about what I actually wants. He gave me a little bit advice in here and there, and as a result we came up with a new hairstyle that I like a lot. His service exceeds my expectation. my suggestion: as a reference, you can bring the pictures and show him the style that you want. but, his advice is definitely something that deserve a consideration too.",positive
"I have been trying to find a good place to get a haircut in Toronto for a long time. I was never satisfied with my haircut before coming to Studio T. Studio T is in J-Town, where there are many stores and restaurants run by Japanese folks. (The food there is fantastic!) I have my hair done by Kame and he is amazing, he is always on time so I never have to wait. He cuts my hair diligently and is very detailed.",positive
"I would give this place a 4 star review based on this guy who did my hair. His name is Masa and he is very friendly and pays attention to detail. I got my hair colored here and I really liked the color. In between when he washed my hair, he have me a head massage which was much appreciated!! However I came back with my mom and sister who also wanted to get their hair colored. My sisters hair turned out fine because Masa dealt with her, but my moms hair turned out HORRIBLE. Don't let the assistant touch your hair!!! She is this stumpy Japanese girl with long blonde hair who speaks no English at all. She made my moms hair 3 different colors. It was like gradation! I don't remember asking for a tie-dye color style for her hair. She doesn't speak English AND is completely rude cause she didn't even apologize. Don't ever let her touch your hair. She is completely useless and stupid. Due to this incident, we had to stay extra 2 hours....SO RIDICULOUS!!!!! Because of her I give this place 1 star.",negative
"Taro is a very talented hair stylist. I've been going to him for around 4 years now, and even after I've moved to NYC, I still go back to him to get my hair cut! He is attentive and a bit of a perfectionist. His suggestions as to what kind of hairstyle fits my face have never disappointed me. From your basic cut and wash to the elaborate Japanese thermal hair straightening, he does it all and he does it well. 5 stars for extremely reasonable prices and excellent service.",positive

"Love SunFire salon! Jonnie does an amazing job on eyelashes, spray tans, and waxing. Love the variety of tanning beds and the girls are so welcoming.",positive
"It was my first time ever getting my hair done by someone other than my mom, who is a hairdresser back in the Midwest. Being that it's cheaper to get done in Oregon rather than flying back, I decided to spread my wings (after I expressed my fear :)). They did an amazing job and made me feel right at home. Priced extremely well for the results, love my hair! Would recommend to anyone!",positive
As a busy working mom I can certainly appreciate the convenience of having all of my services done in one place from tanning to nails to best haircut ever. And great prices the Sunfire seems to be my great find of the year. The tanning beds are sizzling hot. Haven't tried the spray tanning yet but look forward to it. And the specials can't be beat. Renee did my nails exactly as I wanted and that was refreshing. (I tend to be picky) But by far my most favorite aspect of the salon is Heidi my new stylist. Once I sat in her chair purly by coincidence since I was a walk-in the first time I felt she really listened to what I wanted and did her best to achieve that perfect haircut and what do you know I love it. Since then I've become a loyal client even bring in my son who used to be terified of haircuts and now will only allow Heidi to cut his hair. Even let her use clippers this time. And that's huge for the little guy. So ladies and gents go check them out you won't regret it. Promise,positive
Heidi cut my daughter hair in a perfect A-line!!!!! Her hair is soooooo cute!!!!! Heidi cares about the quality of her work.....she really took her time and made sure it was perfect.....thank you Heidi......we wont go anywhere else!!!!!,positive
"I'm sure that if I had a chance to even get a service done here, that I'd be decently satisfied, but the issue is that it seems they never have anyone on schedule that does what you need done. Maybe it's bad luck on my part, but after 5 attempts for different services over the past 6 or 7 months, it's seeming less and less likely that it's bad luck or bad timing. They run plenty of specials, but when you try to take advantage of those specials, they can't provide you with the services advertised. For a while they had $10 haircuts on Mondays, but for some reason, no matter what time it was on a Monday, no one working there could sit my brother down and give him a simple haircut. Now that may have been an anomaly, a one time deal, so we tried the next two weeks, and had the same result. In fact, the last time we tried for him they told us to try to make an appointment on a separate day. (As in not a Monday when it would only cost $10). We ended up just going into medford to get his hair cut for cheaper and as a walk in. My dad tried as well a bit afterwards, and same deal there, not one of the three girls in there knew how to operate a clipper and do a simple hair cut. Those were the first 4 attempts. The fifth (and likely the final time, no matter how close and ""convenient"" they may seem, I don't think I or any one of my family members will try again) was today. I scheduled a nail appointment earlier this week, and less than 2 hours before I was scheduled to go in, I got a call telling me that my girl had a family emergency and she asked me to reschedule. Regardless of her family emergency or not, how is it possible to only have one girl on schedule that can do nails? Especially seeing as they currently have a coupon in circulation advertising a free express manicure or $10 off of a full set of nails. They have that coupon out and only have one girl who knows how to do nails? They usually seem to have 2-4 girls sitting around in there, they have free time to go to restaurants in this complex, order food, sit around for around an hour, but they have NOT had the time or the people to give us the services advertised any of the 5 times we've tried in the past 6 or 7 months? Maybe my opinion of them will change if I get a chance to actually step in there to get my nails done this week, and if my appointment the day after tomorow isn't cancelled again, but so far it's not looking good. It's so much easier to go all the way into medford to get what you need, than it is to play their game and hope that you get lucky and actually get what you need done.",negative
"The inside is outdated, old. Brandy was nice but pushy about me dying my hair after I said No several times. I got home and found out I had lots of really short hairs on the side of my head that I didn't ask for and it is taking forever to grow back. It was only $30 for a haircut and style which is a great price though. But I won't return, I have had better haircuts elsewhere for the same price.",negative
This Supercuts does a great job with color and haircuts. I have been getting my hair colored here for the last several months and it always turns out great! And at such a great price. I have never had a bad haircut and I have had several different stylists. My son is very picky about who cuts his hair and he has never had a bad haircut. The stylists are super friendly and very helpful when I am trying to find the right product for my current hairstyle. I will always come back here to have my hair done. Thanks Supercuts.,positive
"This place depending who you get is awful the hairdresser I had used to cut sheeps in Idaho I think She really screwed up my hair, my general conclusion is I would not go to Supercuts for anything!!",negative
"Older lady with the dark hair super mean, huge attitude. To be fair, I walked in at 4:35 when they close at 5 and I had an appointment at 3:40 so I was super late but still, I apologized and asked if it was too late she could've easily said yes come back tomorrow and I would've walked out the door totally fine and came back the following day. But instead she said no it's fine and then just started tearing my hair out with a comb angrily, I could see her making a face and rolling her eyes at me in the mirror as I Grimaced in pain so I said no thanks and ran out the door . I work in the service Industry as well and I would never treat anyone so rudely. I will never go back here again that's for sure thanks for making me feel so unwelcome and for tearing out my hair.",negative

My tech was also quite rude and spent more time trimming my cuticles than on the nails themselves. Overall this was not a great experience and I definitely won't be going back.",negative

"This place is extremely small (can only take like 3 mani and pedis at a time.) They were great except be careful when selecting an opaque white/cream. Will return for mani/pedi if i choose a diff color. The lady gave me streaks like crazy. ugh. Also got a Brazilian and eyebrow&upper lip. My upper lip broke out a day later and the line I required for the Brazilian looked like a Hitler 'stash (short instead of medium length and thinner)! lol with more vocal input from me it could have been better. My whole bottom was super cleaned off! I would return for the braz but not the face waxing! All in all: cheap, friendly and convenient location. ( right behind Starbucks.) Will return. edit.. just went this morning for another wax. $30 and took no more than 15 min long and I didn't have to wait to go in. LOVED the way she waxed. When I groaned or yelped in pain she just held down the area until the pain subsided or blew on the area. She quickly and professionally wiped aloe vera on the waxed areas. Her English isn't the best so if you have a special request (Brazilian w a ""landing strip"") just make sure you're clear:) Immediately recommended a friend so if you are worried about feeling awkward or in unnecessary pain, THIS is where to go!!",positive
"Three words: cheap. brow. waxing. I always run in here to get my brows waxed. For $8, it's the cheapest price I have found in my area; I have heard Brampton has a lot of salons that charge $2, $3, but after including gas I would be spending like $50 for a brow wax. You don't need to make an appointment and you'll be in and out within 10 minutes.",positive

I have naturally curly hair and wanted to maximise the natural curl for an easy care short style. I was very pleased overall. Terry and Vanessa were both very friendly. I also enjoyed conversation with several other customers there during my visit. It is a small salon, and you must go looking for it. It is on the second floor of El Cortez casino hotel, and you would never find it walking by. Thank you to the hotel staff who told me to take the elevators by the hotel /casino gift shop to the second floor. It was worth looking for.",positive

Terry is great. She's super cute and her shop has a beautiful Old Vegas charm. She did my bridemaid and I's hair for my ceremony. I gave her full artistic license and she ended up doing this pin up-bouffant updo with sparkles. It was exactly what I wanted without even knowing it.,positive

Uptown hair and downtown prices! Terry has done my hair for more than 20 years! She is the best colorist and stylist around. She is a wonderful person and her retro shop is always fun. Love my hair!

"The best cut and colour EVAHHHH! I have been going to this salon since September. To begin they have an amazing online booking system. You pick your stylist and service(s) and time/ date and they slot you in. They are alos clear on pricing too. They remind you and confirm straight to your phone. I love it! Secondly, I am middle aged and I don't want a frumpy cut so I like to go to a studio that is current and modern. Often I feel out of place in more modern settings but this is not the case at Texture. 100% comfort for every guest who comes in. Thirdly, they are professionals. I have just been cutting my hair short for the last 8 months. I came in on Saturday and I was greeted by my amazing stylist Emilie. I had grown out my colour and was trying to own my grey but needed a change. I totally trusted her and now I have an amazing lavender pixie. I have never looked so beautiful. I thought using the ""fun"" colours would age me but instead I look 20 years younger. She never pushed and just knew what to do... and it looks amazing... like I have naturally violet hair... I have never been so happy with my hair in years. I have in the last 48 hours given out all the cards I took with me. I am stopped to say how great my hair is and I just am thrilled there are good salons like this exist.",positive
"Best haircut of my life. I still can't get over what a great job Emelie did! She's so good at her job, it's obvious she was meant to cut hair. I'll definitely be going back again!",positive
Had my hair cut by Ashley today and she did an awesome job! She was very attentive and listened to my needs and took what I requested and tailored it to my hair texture. She suggested thinning out my hair which I haven't done in a while and I couldn't be more thankful. I have super thick hair so it moves so much better now that it's not so weighed down. She's a sweetheart and you can truly see that she not only knows what she's doing but that she's also passionate about doing it.,positive
"I cannot say enough amazing things about Jessica. She is so super talented. THE boss when it comes to colour art! I found my forever hairstylist. Hands down. She took me from drab to tres chic. I have a perfect colour melt, beautiful style & healthier hair. Being on multiple harsh medications that really effect my hair, she was able to work with my hair and get the right red colours to shine through. She was very detailed on what the process would be before beginning, what products she used, gave tips on maintenance aftercare, came in below my budget and made sure I was completely satisfied with everything before walking out the door. She truly loves what she does and it shows through in her work. She is easy to talk to and listens to exactly what the client wants. Even better is I can look forward to an affordable maintenance plan so I can keep up this new great look that matches my personality. Thank you Jessica for reviving my hair and me!! I cannot recommend Jessica enough. You're search for a colourist stops here!!",positive
"Updated: Honestly, Allison, I think your justifications are odd. I came in to get a few silver highlights put into my bangs. If you couldn't do it, you should have said so. Instead I got yellow and dark brown bumble bee highlights to the middle of my head that don't match my natural hair at all. Plus, now I've got regrowth And yes, when I calculated what i paid to your salon, i did include the generous tips i left. How you could let me leave looking the way I did (which i couldn't tell because of the lighting in your salon) is beyond me. If anyone wants to see the outcome of your work, I've uploaded the photos to my profile - so take a look. And yes, in my many years of going to hair salons, I've posted three bad reviews and yours is one. Honestly, you're the absolute worst. You should feel embarrassed but, clearly, that's not in your repertoire. ......... After growing out my grey hair for three years, while keeping it long, I decided I'd put a few DIY highlights at the front of my bangs, where the hair is still pretty dark. Dumb idea. I went for a fix, but the tone was still off, so I called Texture, where there's a really great colourist who knows how to work with grey. She wasn't available, and I was heading into two weeks of travel and client presentations, so I asked if there was anyone else there experienced at matching grey hair. I was told that Allison, the owner, was. I paid $170 for silver highlights in my bangs. Unfortunately, Allison made a mess of it, giving me big yellow streaks that didn't match my hair at all, then, as an initial attempt to correct the problem, extending it all about three inches back into my natural hair. The result was terrible, dwarfing the issue I started with. The only solution at that point was to put a demi colour on the whole thing to try and get rid of the now very large section of yellowed hair and create some semblance of a unified colour. I understand that mistakes happen. Such is life. But Allison then charged me an additional $75 for the 'fix', bringing me up to $250 for my botched bangs (not to mention the hours i spent at the salon), which still don't match. I was also told that i would now need to tone this big front section of hair, now, every few weeks to keep the yellow at bay, until it grows out - in about a year or so. A very disappointing outcome and customer service experience, all round.",negative
"I absolutely recommend this salon! I saw Dasha and I could not ask for a better experience. She listened to my concerns (I recently had a cut at another salon / it literally looked like I had 3 separate hair cuts that did not blend together....) and I did not want to lose too much length. Dasha took the time to explain options and when all was said and done, I left the salon feeling great about my new cut. She even took the time to show me some different styling options! I will definitely be going back!!!",positive
Fantastic experience! Just moved to the city a little while ago and was dreading finding a new stylist. I easily booked an appointment online after reading good reviews here on Yelp. Booked with Allison and had a great experience. Showed her some pictures of where I wanted to go in terms of a new look. She totally got it and was super positive. Even though I'm a guy my hair can be a disaster in the wrong hands and I can tell this is an excellent cut already. I'll be back. Highly recommended!,positive
"I gave Textür a try because I read great reviews about it online. I've now had my hair cut there twice (by Allison) and have been very happy both times. I was inspired by their Instagram feed to ask for an undershave under my usual bob and Allison made a nice design in the shaven hair. When I went back for bang trims/undershave cleanups, she continued to switch it up with great designs. She also recommended underlayering for my thick hair, and I loved it! The way she cuts my hair, I am actually able to replicate the result at home with a hair straightener, which never seems to be the case with other stylists. Plus, there's an adorable little doggy in the studio named Burger. Needless to say, I'll be going back! *Same review posted on Google.",positive
"New to Toronto. I'm very picky about getting my hair cut. Dasha did an excellent job getting an idea of what I wanted and I couldn't be happier with the results. Welcoming and friendly staff, non-pretentious, good tunes playing on the radio, tea or coffee if you want it while you wait, and an awesome little dog named Burger who will sit in your lap if you're cool with it. I'll be back at Textur for my next cut and I suggest you do the same, you won't be disappointed.",positive
"Went in for a haircut, The experience started off alright, I explained what I wanted and she said she could handle that. When she washed my hair she didn't ask about pressure or temperature, and I was a bit taken aback when I told her I was getting over a cold and she told me not to breath on her. She didn't place a towel over my shoulders so my shirt got soaked while she was cutting. She did not add layers to my curly hair so I've ended up with a strange triangle shape which, a few people have pointed out, is massively uneven one side to the other. Someone said it looks like I did it myself. when she was done she handed me a mirror to look at it, but didn't ask how I felt abut the length. I called to see what could be done (ive never called to complain anout something before) but no one called back. I'm disappointed as I had a great experience with another stylist previously. I live and work in the area and I will not be recommending this place.",negative
"Let's be real, finding a new hairdresser can be a daunting experience. You get recommendations, but you never really know if you'll leave happy until you go and try them out. In my personal experience, I have been disappointed pretty much every single time I tried somewhere new... until I found Dasha at Textur. Admittedly, I'm not the easiest client and I like to switch up my style pretty regularly. Having said that, I have had appointments when I have gone in with specific photos of what I want done, and appointments when I have left it entirely up to her to decide what to do with my hair. In either scenario, I am always leaving with a huge smile on my face and, as cheesy as this may sound, feeling like a new person. And it's not just me, both my wife (who also sees Dasha) and I have had complete strangers complimenting our hair and asking where we got it done. The entire team at Textur is equally fantastic. I am greeted with a smile and nothing but positive vibes every time I visit. I'm always made to feel welcomed and comfortable by literally everyone I interact with here (including their famous pooch, Burger). I cannot say enough about Dasha and Textur, and no Yelp review will be able to accurately describe how you will feel walking out of this place, finally being truly satisfied with your hair. Go check them out to understand what I'm talking about. I promise you, you will not be disappointed.",positive
"I was trekking back to the suburbs for the last three years since I've moved down into the city, for a haircut that I could trust and afford. Finally, a friend recommended Alison @ Textur and I haven't had to head north of the 401 since. Headsup, Burger runs the place, no matter what anyone else says.",positive
Love my colour and cut by Trish! I wanted a colour change (hadn't done it in years) and she gave a great consultation on what would work for me. I've received numerous compliments on my hair. Thanks Trish! The salon has a great vibe and everyone is super friendly. Totally recommend this place!,positive
"Wanted to make a change in stylists, and so glad that I took a chance here. Jessica gave me exactly what I wanted and talked about a game plan to slowly grow out my hair with the utmost enthusiasm. Can't wait to go back.",positive
Had my haircut today by Tiffany!!!!!! It was absolutely amazing! She is amazing she really listened to my concerns and needs. Im extremely picky and can never find the perfect cut for my face shape she really took her time and give me the perfect cut plus showed me how to style and take care of my hair. Just an amazing experience at the salon.,positive
Great salon in Leslieville. Allison cut my hair and gave me exactly what I wanted. I was able to get in same day (thankfully!) and the price was fantastic.,positive
"Fantastic personal service in a great environment from passionate hair experts. My only complaint is price. $40 for a men's cut is definitely on the high side. Then again, they're right around the corner and it's hard to put a price on convenience :-)",positive
Walked in to Thairapy and was told they do not accept walk ins. I asked if i could schedule an appointment with Mimi because I was referred to her by a friend. The girl at the front desk said that she was booked all month long and that she would give Mimi my number and they would get back to me. It has been over a week and I have heard nothing. I am willing to spend good money on my hair with the right stylist and have heard and seen nothing but great things as far as Mimi's work. This absolutely leaves a bad taste in my mouth. It seems like the front desk is not organized. I do not understand why they would need to call me back just to schedule an appointment for next month.,negative
"Blush Salon is no more, but lucky for me and the other thick haired girls of the west Valley, its best parts have been reincarnated in a fresh new salon called Thairapy. Located just a mile or so up the road at Wigwam and Indian School, the new space is roomier, has better parking, and is just steps away from several tasty lunch options if you want to make a day of it. I am completely enamored with my stylist, Shamika, who is the divine combination of hair genius, gorgeous tall model, and wicked funny honest. She has big dreams and I have full confidence that she will nail them all. Her hands are magic on my hair, which in its natural state is grey, heavy, flat and boring. Before my head gave up on making brown hair, Shamika colored it with amazing expertise: blond, brown, caramel, you name it. Once I went fully grey and silver, she encouraged me to embrace that natural beauty. I'm so glad I listened. Her cuts are equally brilliant. She's taken me super short, she's twirled me into shoulder length sexy waves, and she's currently got me in an a-line bob for summer. No matter what, I leave looking good and feeling empowered. Thairapy clients are welcomed by Alexis, who is charming and adept at keeping everyone happy. They offer beverages and snacks bits from a bakery just across the parking lot, and plenty of stylish and comfy seating if you arrive early. While I truly adore Shamika (also known as Mimi) the talent in this salon is all top notch. When I needed an urgent cut on a fully booked Shamika day, she referred a colleague named Danielle who snipped my messy strands into a perfect chic bob. It is truly an indulgence to put myself in a Thairapy chair. My haircuts are $45, and well worth it.",positive
Haircut was great. Jewelz listened to what I wanted and did a great job with my hair. A little pricier than most but I was happy with the end result. As a first time customer I received a 20% discount which was really nice.,positive
"This salon is classy and so professional. Shamika is my go to stylist. She is AMAZING at blonde highlights and bayalage. She listens to me as a client and executes exactly what you're looking for. I would 100% recommend her to anyone looking for a personable & professional hairstylist. She is honest, genuine, and cares about her clients.",positive
YYyyaaaassss!!!! I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS SALON! I had my appointment with Melissa and she did your girl awesome. Went in for color and not just any color but PURPLE of all colors and it came out fabulous!! Many salons told me it couldn't be done but she did. I am highly satisfied with the results. Plus the whole staff complimented me and were super nice!! Can't wait for my next appointment!,positive
Love everything about this new salon. Just visited today for a cut and full highlight/color. Melissa is such a gem and does such a fantastic job with my stubborn hair. I actually drive all the way from south Chandler to see her because she is THAT good. Thairapy Salon is so classy inside. You can tell that the ladies take extreme pride in their services. You won't be disappointed.,positive
"I'll follow Melissa anywhere! She has an amazing way with my frizzy, brittle hair. I love the new salon. It's well decorated and classy, there is easy parking, and the whole staff is amazing. I highly recommend Thairapy Salon!",positive
"The salon is beautifully decorated. The hair stations are clean and well spaced. But the stylists are what make this salon great! Jewlz is my girl and I have followed her to 3 salons now - she is so knowledgable about hair. She listens to what I would like but also makes suggestions on what she thinks could be best - I trust her opinion, she is the professional after all! She also cuts my 8 yr old daughter's hair and she's so sweet when she works with her. Recently, we both went in for a cut and I had told my daughter we didn't have time for Ms. Jewlz to curl her hair. My daughter went first and was waiting for me to be finished when Jewlz started to curl my hair with the flat iron - just some each beauty waves. Well my daughter says ""hey! no fair!"" and kinda smiles and pouts at the same time. Watching this happen, Nicolette, the stylist next to Jewlz, takes my daughter to her chair and puts some curls in her hair while I was finishing up - my daughter left there BEAMING and GIGGLING! She was elated! It was so very sweet of Nicolette! That story is what THairapy Salon is all about - making every client feel beautiful when they leave the salon! If you are not thrilled with your current stylist - give Therapy a chance! You will not be disappointed!",positive
"This salon is filled with incredibly talented stylists! Nicolette is amazing, she's passionate about what she does and it shows in her work. Not only does she do hair magic, she's also super down to earth and will help you have realistic exceptions of what your hair will look like. She has done my hair every color I have asked (a lot of colors) and she's always made me look and feel beautiful!!",positive
"Gorgeous salon filled with the sweetest, most talented hair stylists. Danielle has been making me feel beautiful for 11+ years now, she is a must for your hair goals! #hippiehairchick",positive
The space is beautiful! Love the location and Danielle does an amazing job. I absolutely love my highlights! If you are looking for a professional salon and amazing and experienced stylists (ahem Danielle especially!!!) tryvour Thairapy!!!,positive
"I've been going to the big chain stores to get my hair cut for maybe 10 years, this is the first local barbershop/salon that I've been to in a while. First and foremost, when you walk in, the place just screams comfort. It's not a very big place, but you feel immediately welcome. The stylist that cut my hair was inviting and helped me decide on what to do. It's not as cheap as those big stores but you get a detailed cut that isn't rushed. I say if you're looking for a good locally owned shop stop in.",positive
"I've never really cared about my hair... I usually just walk into whatever the closest barber is and tell them to do their best, and am generally pretty happy with the results. This time around, I decided I'd actually proactively look for a well-rated salon, and I'm so so happy I found this place! Melissa was super super patient, and obviously knew her craft really well. She took the time to help me choose a cut I'd be happy with (quite the feat) as well as came up with a morning styling regimen that fit my needs and showed me how to style my hair. Couldn't be happier with the cut or the service, and I know I'll be coming here regularly for haircuts from now on. This is one of those world-class small business gems. [Note: They've been having some problems with their phone system, so don't be discouraged if you have problems calling them... they're definitely open!]",positive
Stopped in to get my teen boys haircuts before Christmas parties. Owner Melissa was super nice and did a great job. We will be back!,positive
"Was in town on business and needed a quick cut. I got in without a wait and Britney did A pretty good job considering it was her first time cutting my hair. It's a no frills place and if you are a simple guy with an easy cut, I bet it's perfect for you and fairly priced.",positive
Guys just go there I am sure you are going to get satisfied. Guys don't explain too much what they want it's ok she will grab your ideas and will know what you want. And I should say it is like ordering a coffee it's fast. I can keep on praising these pretty ladies. I got a hair cut from Britney .going there is worth your money .,positive
"I've got curly hair that I like to keep longer and style loosely but still need to look trimmed enough to pass for professional. I have gone to a half dozen shops over the last 4 years that say they specialize in men's hair, described what I wanted, worked with them over a couple sessions to give them a chance to figure things out, and never come away feeling like I got my money's worth. I did the same for Melissa and her first response was ""I don't know what the hell is wrong with those other people"" and she got to work. Hands down the best haircut I've had in years. Not only that, but since I was passing through town for work, she took time to describe what she did so I could explain it to someone else down the road. So if you're looking for a new spot, Melissa is definitely worth a visit. For me, if I lived in this city this would be the only place I'd need to go.",positive
"I usually do not pay more than $10 for a haircut, but since I moved to this area I was unable to find a quality haircut in my original budget. However, I tried out the Man Cave Salon and I was very impressed. I finally got a good haircut! Melissa was very friendly and engaging. She is also a very good barber and cut my hair exactly as I wanted it. Facility was clean. Not the biggest place and I would imagine it gets busy (it wasn't the day I went) but you can make an appointment. Highly recommended.",positive
"I recently moved from Akron to Tallmadge and was looking for a local convenient spot to get my hair cut. I have had three cuts at The Man Cave and will be a regular there now. When I read Brian's review, I felt compelled to come in and give my own, especially due to one statement that I thought might keep people away and is completely out of sync with my three visits. Brian is a regular reviewer on Yelp. Maybe he will reconsider and edit. Maybe just a bad day? First and foremost, I think it is important that if we are going to review someplace, we review the product. You know, if I am looking for a restaurant, I want to know how the food is. I am a 50 year old business man. As a veteran of the military, I never really changed my cut much over the years. I part on the side, and I like a very short, clean cut look. I am typically loyal to a local barber. For the first time in a long time, I have received compliments on my hair after Melissa cut it. Multiple compliments. Seriously, my look is similar, but my hair looks sharper and it has probably been 30 years since anyone even noticed it. It is a great cut and I will certainly send people there, including my father when he is in town. For the record, my father is 72, a retired business executive, and he isn't looking for ""attitude,"" nor am I. That brings me to the points I would like to politely rebut, so that you at least feel comfortable giving it a try. The review in question states it is a bit expensive for a ""humble cut."" I would say it is a humble price for a professional cut. The price is less than 20 bucks. It cost about the same as a fast food trip for two. It is very expensive to keep a small business running these days. Priced health insurance lately? Rent? Even if you go to a chain, you are going to pay this in many cases. My wife pays anywhere from 3 to 5 times this amount. You can find cheaper barbers. As I have stated, I am sticking with this place for the foreseeable future. I am a value buyer. I look for ""bang for the buck."" The review in question states that there are two ""distractions."" One of those is an attractive, ""cool"" person cutting your hair. Um... Why does the persons appearance have anything to do with the product? I am really scratching my head over this one. If you are insecure, yeah, you can go to another place I guess. I didn't give it a thought. She can weigh a hundred pounds, or 250 pounds, as long as I walk away with the same quality hair cut. Now for the complete disconnect. The other reviewer states that the haircut is served up with attitude. What!? Just disregard that. That is so far from reality that I can only guess that it either was tied to the other issue with the stylists looks, or maybe he just had a bad day, at worst a misunderstanding. I have waited in there with every seat full, half of them with guys like me, half with kids with cool young cuts. The owner walked over and poured us each a cup of coffee if we wanted one. Politely and professionally. She always shows concern for the length of your wait and gives you updates. The salon has a consultative approach. You will be asked some polite, concise questions to insure you get the cut you want. The communication is very good. I also learned about new hair products (who knew that styling gel was so 1980's). Melissa recommended a product that works fantastic on my hair and keeps it in place. It is similar to going to a good establishment to buy a suit. They consult with you and make you look better. I need all the help I can get. Give it a try. Great customer service and work ethic. Great hair cut.",positive
"I had been looking for a place to get my hair cut as my previous barber closed her shop. I wanted someplace close to home (Stow) but I was willing to drive to find a shop I felt comfortable at. Man Cave is that type of place. Melissa took my appointment on short notice and when I first walked in they have a big chalkboard with a quote on it from Bob Feller (one of my all-time favorite Indians) and a chalk drawing of Chief Wahoo, I really liked this ambiance. Melissa is a good barber/stylist, I explained what I wanted and she completed the cut perfectly. I like to have hair rinsed after the cut and it was no problem. She made some good recommendations on product and showed me the difference between different types. I have been back twice since then and this is now my regular hair shop.",positive
"I, like a growing percentage of men, put effort in their appearance so that they make a good impression before even saying hello. Melissa gets that. Not only does she take care in making sure that you understand how what you are asking for is going to actually look on you, she explains variations and options to make your future style your own. I'll admit, I was wary when I first left, not sure if how it was cut that day was how I wanted it. But I did exactly what she said, and let it grow a few days, and I can't even count all the compliments I've gotten since. I cannot speak highly enough of Melissa and the pride she takes in her work. I would absolutely wait until the next time I visit Kent, just so I could go back to her. A. Motherf#cking. Plus.",positive
"This place solved my problem of never knowing the place to go for a good haircut. Melissa is the owner, and she is extremely nice, and also fantastic at cutting hair. I will not go anywhere else. You will not get a $10 haircut in price or quality. However, you get what you pay for, and that is why I keep going back -- and will not go anywhere else. You actually get to know your hairdresser, and Melissa knows her stuff. 5*'s",positive
"My first time at The Office Salon and I was matched with the most talented, beautiful Sarah. Unsure about what exactly to do with my hair, Sarah envisioned the perfect color and cut - and easily explained the techniques she would use. Sarah is meticulous and has unbelievable creativity. She literally transformed my hair and I have never been happier with it. Sarah is an expert in her field, and has this amazing warm, positive energy! Also, the salon's owner and stylist - Kevin, and stylists -Max and Matt - have the best sense of humor, energy, and skill. This salon is a little family of their own. You're not going to find another environment like this one Never looking for another place to go.",positive
"Wonderful salon. I just moved from Los Angeles and needed to find a new salon in Phoenix. I love the Davanes products that I have been using. I started my search looking for salons that used these products. Then I narrowed it to the one with the best reviews. That was the Office Salon. To say I do not my around Phoenix is being generous. This salon is not anyway near where I live. However, Sara is so good I made two more appointments and I will keep coming back. This salon is incredible. Glad I found it.",positive
"Sara was so awesome. Super sweet and without even giving much direction, gave the perfect cut i wanted! Will definitely be back!",positive
"I came to the Office because I'd lived in Phoenix for one year and had a hard time finding a stylist for my pixie cut. After several attempts at different places, I tried the Office and had a great experience with Sarah. She took the time to talk to me about what I wanted and had great recommendations. She listened to what I wanted, and now she's been helping me grow out my pixie cut and given me suggestions for the difficult stages. This is a fun place to go and I always feel comfortable here.",positive
"My first time here! Recommended by several friends, and I was not disappointed. Sarah did an amazing job on my long and lifeless hair, gave me some layers and taught me some tricks to replicate at home! I'll definitely be back!!",positive
"Kevin at the Office is amazing with cut & color. After trying several barber shops/salons around town, I have found my home. I have short hair, so typically for a cut I would go see a barber, but with Kevin he actually shapes and styles my hair unlike anyone else has. I always get compliments. For color, I wouldn't trust anyone else. I always get exactly what I ask for. Also, the salon is very cute and all of the staff are friendly and professional. Check it out!",positive
"I was in a hair rut and went out on a limb after reading the Yelp reviews and was not disappointed! Matthew has cut my hair twice now and I love love love both styles! It's super stressful trusting your hair to someone you don't know, but Matthew is so knowledgeable--from the products to use, to best styles for hair types and the steps he's taking throughout the appointment. Definitely get a spot with Matthew before he books up!",positive
"This place was great. I was recommended to use a stylist here by a friend. She happened to be leaving on vacation but they still got me in next day with another one. He was amazing, made me comfortable with the big change I was going to have. Had 15 inches cut off and it turned out great. I get compliments on it all the time. He even told me to call if I had any problems styling it or if I find any problems. Strongly recommend going here.",positive
"I am new to the area and found The Office had desirable Yelp reviews. Trying a new salon and stylist can be scary stuff! I am pleased to say that I LOVED everything about my visit. My stylist Max was marvelous. He took the time to truly listen to what I wanted, he was vocal about everything he was doing and offered perfect solutions to my hair woes. I was super impressed with his round brush technique and my color turned out better than I had expected. The other stylists were friendly and the salon itself had a great vibe. I am coming back for sure and will be trusting Max to work his magic on my hair again.",positive
I love this place! It brightens my day when I know I get to come here and get my hair done. The atmosphere is very welcoming and by the time you leave you will feel like you've known them forever! Max does an amazing job with my hair and actually gives me the look that I am going for.,positive
"You have got to go to The Office for some fun and a great, great cut!!!!!! Usually I get my hair cut in a familiar salon near my house. I have been thinking of growing it a bit longer so I am in between styles. On vacation this week and out of state, I decided to look on yelp for a place that specializes in shorter styles and yelp reviews for Sherri were a 5 across the board. I figured what the heck and I made an appointment right on line. Convenient!! Sherri was as awesome as my haircut. She asked me a lot of questions before she started to cut which helped her understand how much (or little in my case) that I want to spend on my style once I am out of the shower. Sherri's questions put me at ease and when all was said and done my haircut was super, and easy to care for. Sherri took time to teach me how to apply products like pom and different looks with the same cut. Thanks to all the crew at The Office",positive
"Came from So Cal for Spring training baseball. Has long hair and decided to get it cut while here in Phoenix. Did some Yelp searching and decided Sherri was the one to do it. Scheduling was very easy. Sherri asked me lots of questions on what on hair cut I was leaning towards, and care and time I was willing to invest in to keep it looking good. We looked through some Styles on Pinterest. I am thrilled and very happy with my new style. Awesome cut Sherri. I would seriously consider driving 5 hours to have her keeping it looking great too!!! Great friendly stylist all in all.",positive
"It is all true about Sherri! She is amazing!! I wanted to cut my extra-long hair into a pixie, and she is the only hairdresser who would agree to do the cut! I have never gotten so many compliments on my hair!!",positive
"Sherri is awesome! I'm just a dude, so I don't know about color, etc. But I do have difficult hair to deal with (what's left of it anyway). And she does a great job making me look presentable. And even when all of my hair is gone, I'll keep coming in for those awesome head massages.",positive
"Love this place! Was going to the same spot for years and needed a change. So I gave The Office a shot. Soooo glad I did. It's scary trusting your hair to someone new, but Kevin was such a pro that I immediately felt comfortable. He asked a ton of questions up front to make sure we were on the same page. I got a cut and color and left feeling happier about my hair than I have in years. So glad I found a new place!",positive
"I am not a typical female-- going to the salon for me is torture rather than pleasure. I just don't like to sit idle and am a busy body. Recently, late one afternoon, I decided it was time for a haircut. I jumped on YELP and typed in best salons in Phoenix"" Keep in mind I had no appointment and was calling around with the expectation of getting in within the hour. I really lucked out because I found Matthew at ""The Office"" He was just about to leave for the day when I called. Not only did he stay late for my haircut, but after I got there and we started talking, he suggested color which although I knew I needed I had not dared to expect both cut and color at 5pm without an appointment! Matthew is as sweet as they come. We chatted and I felt extremely comfortable with him. The end result of my color and cut could not have been any closer to exactly what I wanted. He is very knowledgeable regarding color. I would highly reccommend The Office and Matthew in particular. I don't have any experience with any of the other stylists there.",positive
"I found Jamie by simply searching ""Pixie Cuts"" on Yelp. I've been trying to keep my hair short but after a busy couple months, my hair was starting to get the characteristic mullet. Jamie spruced me up, showed me some different ways that I can style my hair and voila! She really did a great job and is so flexible with her time that she worked me in for a quick neck trim a month later. Highly recommend, especially if you are thinking of taking the plunge and trying short hair!",positive
Jaime expertly tamed my below-the-butt locks and left me feeling more like I had just had a makeover than a solid trim. Love her.,positive
I was really looking forward to my appointment based on the reviews. I left work early for a 3:30 appointment....which they apparently never put in the schedule. I had scheduled with the stylist herself...so no miscommunication between stylist and scheduler was to blame. So now I have to take off work early again on another day to go to another appointment....with another salon. I'm disappointed they couldn't get the basics right.,negative
"What more can I say about Jaime!?!? So patient (I have a ton of hair), such an awesome communicator (always makes sure I'm getting exactly what I want) and will work to get your hair the way you want it, not the way she wants it. I've been going to Jaime for almost a year and a half now and I've never been happier with my hair. She saved my platinum blonde mess and made it look far more natural than it ever had before. When I decided I wanted to change it up and go ombre, she took the challenge on and now I'm rocking an awesome style that gets complimented almost every day. Thank you, Jaime, for rescuing me from my platinum nightmare and making me feel more naturally beautiful. Also, going to The Office Salon is always a fun time - Kevin and Sherri are hilarious and there is always a great mix of clientele and music. Their product line is amazing and the environment is always clean and inviting.",positive
"I moved to Scottsdale in 2010. The most important service to find was a good cosmetologist. I tried an expensive salon in old town and didn't have a good experience. The best thing that happened for me since moving here was meeting Kevin Anderson through a mutual friend/client of his. He is truly a great hair stylist and a genuine, wonderful person. I look forward to seeing him every time and always leave with beautiful hair - many compliments and friends who have gone to him also because of how my hair looks - cut, color and style. He knows what will look good for each person. I am so happy for him to have his own salon now, he was formerly at Dylan's in Arcadia. Wish him all the best, he will be my stylist as long as I live here!!!",positive
Thank you Sherri for another great cut & color!! This is a great salon! Great atmosphere and very friendly service! Highly recommend!!,positive
"Sherri is the best ever! I have hopped around to different salons all over the Phoenix/ Scottsdale area and I finally feel like I have found a place that I am going to make my one and only hair salon. Sherri takes time to listen to what I want done and she asks questions to make sure that it is going to come out exactly how I want it (and it always does). With many other places I have been I have felt the need to rush home and fix my hair style after I leave, but with Sherri I want to go out and show off what she has done. She is also super cool and funny and easy to talk to. I would recommend Sherri to anyone!",positive
If you are looking for a place for great hair and a comfortable salon this is the place to try. Kevin is the best my hair has never been in better condition since I started going to Kevin. Along with the products i will reference as hair crack smells yummy. Check them out very relaxed and comfortable.,positive
"Kevin has been my trusted colorist and stylist for several years. As most women know, the hairdresser client bond is often times more important than any romantic relationship. He is a friend and incredibly talented. He is also very competitive price wise and I would follow him anywhere. I am thrilled he has his own adorable yet chic salon of his own.",positive
"I love this salon! From the stylist to the decor this place is great. Jaime V. has been my stylist for awhile now and I won't see anyone else but her! I trust her, her style and judgement with my hair. She's honest and a perfectionist. You won't leave disappointed if you go see Jaime!",positive
"Jaime has been doing my hair for months! I seriously wouldn't let any else touch my hair besides her! She knows exactly what I want every time I go in and keeps track of what we have done with my hair in the past. She is simply amazing and has the greatest personality, I adore her! The Office Salon has such a retro cool vibe yet makes you feel right at home. I look forward to my appointment each and every time. If you are looking for a great stylist (Jaime, Sherri or Kevin) and a cool place to get your hair done... GO to The Office Salon!!",positive
Kevin the owner is the best very knowledgable and polite. He really knows his way around a head of hair. Gives the best head massages while washing your hair.,positive
"Not sure. Had a 10:00 appointment, and owner?/stylist was a no show. Finally called at 10:15 and said was having trouble getting a cab. Hard to own a small business if you can't manage guest expectations or time.",negative
"I was referred to Kevin by a friend after having a few coloring disasters by multiple hair stylists. I came to him with a spectrum of wrong colors going through my hair and he was able to make me look amazing. It is never brassy and it always still feels healthy afterwards, not dry and damaged like other times I have had it overprocessed. It is a little of a drive for me but I would follow him anywhere!! It has been almost 2 years now and every time I get my highlights, I am so relieved that my hair is in the care of his talented hands. I highly recommend him!",positive
I went to Kristy twice and told her exactly what I wanted but I didn't like either haircut in fact I went home in tears after the last one. I think she is great for younger people but I am older. I will not return.,negative
"Chelsea cuts my hair -- she's great. Kristy doesn't cut my hair, but she's great too. Found this salon on Yelp when I moved into town a year ago and I'm glad I gave them a call. Online booking makes it easy for me to set appointments, and Chelsea will often text me to let me know when she's available earlier than planned in case I want to come in sooner. Definitely recommend them.",positive
"I have been going to Kristy for my hair needs, for over a year. She was my first choice for hair and makeup for my wedding this past October, and she did not disappoint. She made the drive to Sedona and was amazing with her work. Always prompt and professional, she even did my mother's hair and everything turned out beautiful. I'm so happy with the way that my wedding pictures came out, Kristy enhanced my features so that the makeup and hair would pop. If you want something done the right way, go to The Shear Shack, you won't regret it, absolutely love this place.",positive
Been looking long and hard for a salon to help me with my edgy pixie experimentation. Kristy was awesome and very attentive to what I wanted to try. Affordable with quality.,positive
"Love this place - Kristy does a fantastic job with my highlights and is very patient with doing my hair (I have A LOT, our last appointment took 3 hours when only allotted for 2.5 - I'm so sorry but thank you!!). Her salon is cute, clean, and charming. Highly recommend!",positive
I recently had my hair done (cut & highlights) at The Shear Shack....I love it!!! Kristy did a fantastic job! My highlights came out just how I wanted & the cut was actually better than what I thought I wanted. I was unsure of a cut/style as I'm trying to grow my hair out from a very short cut & Kristy took my idea along with her own (of course she asked me before she just snipped away) & I absolutely love it!!! I will be back for sure! Definitely recommend The Shear Shack! :),positive
"I got my hair dyed purple and I followed their instructions very clearly and yet it was gone from most of my hair within 2 weeks. I only washed my hair once in a week with cold water, which is what they instructed which is why I find it weird it faded so quickly. I honestly think they either did a bad job dying my hair or they used a cheap hair dye. I called to let them know and they said I could get it re-dyed for $75 but I was not willing to risk paying that kind of money again for nothing. I also got a haircut and I'm highly pleased with it. Would only recommend you go here, to cut your hair not to dye your hair. Overall I'm giving it 1 star because I feel like I wasted my money, on dying my hair although the staff was very friendly.",negative
"I'm a 24 year old female who was having a hard time finding a good hair stylist. I've tried many of the cheaper $15 dollar hair cut places and odds are, 9/10 times my hair was always messed up on in some way, took way too much off (yea hair grows back but I'm paying you to listen to what I'm requesting, not just do your own thing and have me out of your chair in 10 minutes) or my layers were choppy beyond belief!!! I searched and searched and finally took to yelp to see if there was anything near by I hadn't seen or heard of before, that's where I saw this place. All the great reviews are what made me pick this place for my next hair cut. Like a gal before me states, you pay $15 bucks and you get a $15 dollar hair cut. I've had my hair dyed at a salon but never cut so I wasn't really aware of what to expect. The building this is located in, I'll admit I went through the wrong door the first time around and got horribly lost lol. Now I know. Walking in, it's smaller than what I'm used to BUT it's also not a chain company, it's someone who wanted to start their own business to make their dream a reality. I arrived early for my appointment and was greeted, I sat down and explained my horror stories of past hair cuts and pleaded for her to please be my holy grail lol she then asked me to go to the shampoo bowl so I'm like okay. Yes I have thick hair, it needs to be drenched with water before hand..then conditioner ! Oh okay, I like this...then a nice little towel dry and then the magic began. Chelsea took her time with cutting my hair the exact way I wanted and didn't stray from my idea. I was in the chair for a little over an hour and I cannot explain how pleased I am of the overall result of my afternoon mini spa day there. There was some nice casual conversation, not dead silent or being ignored by the stylist. I was included in every conversation which made me feel like I was having my hair done by a long lost friend. It was $40 flat for the cut, shampoo, condition AND. Blow out!! All included (then whatever you tip) I can now say I have found my holy grail. I will never stray from you!",positive
"Kristy is great! Does a perfect cut and k ones how to add great color. Tried the color just at the roots and it looks awsome. Used a Coarl color and it almost looks natural, but fun still!",positive
"Love, love, love The Shear Shack Salon!!! I can't say enough good things... I was looking for a new salon (moved to phoenix about 5 months ago) and found Kristy's place on Yelp. Made an appointment to see Chelsea, don't let her age fool you, babygirl is SUPER talented! Chelsea did such an amazing job, I have never ever received so many compliments on my hair before ;) I can't wait for my next appointment! Thank you so much Kristy and Chelsea, you girls ROCK!!!",positive
"I am pretty picky about who touches my hair.... I mean, I guess most of us are....anyway, Chelsea took care of me and my two daughters and now she is my new stylist. She knows how to deal with people and make them feel at ease and she definitely has skillz :p",positive
"I've never received as many compliments as I have since I started seeing Kristy - well over a year ago. I will never change and I will ALWAYS book in advance. First off, when I moved here from the midwest my hair underwent disaster after disaster as I tried to save a couple bucks and go to Chain-Hair salons. I finally saw this place with excellent reviews and decided that if Kristy could see me - I would give it a shot. I never imagined that I would recommend her services to all my friends and even the people I meet out and about. What's so great about the Shear Shack. Well Kristy for one, but as you've seen on other reviews, Chelsea now for reason number 2. They often overlap with each other so I feel confident in Chelsea's abilities/training and customer service since Kristy is there teaching her how she runs the Shack. So reason number 3 is all the compliments I get on my hair. Which translates into expertise and skill. These compliments range from the color (usually something in the reds but her crafty color skills are dazzling), the healthy shine, the bounce and volume, the realistic look...I could just keep going. Kristy takes the time to consider more than just what a client wants, but what is realistic. She discusses the pros and cons, and helps guide the client through the process. Kristy will advise the client on how to achieve the end result and maintain the integrity of the hair. #4 Cost - SUPER REASONABLE. You get what you pay for. So if you want a $15 haircut - your hair will probably look like you got a $15 hair cut. Kristy's prices sometimes surprise me in how reasonable they are. I like to touch up my roots (again, red is not the easiest color to maintain when your hair grows super fast) every three-four weeks. This would cost me a fortune at other salons, but Kristy keeps it super reasonable. In fact, her prices were one of the reasons I chose her. I've had whole color applications, high lights, low lights, cuts, styles, and loved what I paid every time. #5 Time and Respect. I've never waited more than ~10 minutes before for an appointment. Kristy books responsibly and holds her appointments. She is always there when she says she is. I know I can count on her keeping to our time so I don't miss a hot date later that night. Once, I even missed my appointment and she called and was able to reschedule me. I loved that she understood I had forgotten (one and time - I'm a woman of my word too) but still really needed my hair fixed up. Other stylists don't bother calling you but I love the text reminders/email reminders I get. I love that I can book online too. From my experience - she is great with kid cuts, weekly hair maintenance, men's cuts, women's everything. I could just keep going on and on but will let you find out for yourself!",positive
"SO happy I found Shear Shack! I just moved back to AZ from the midwest and was really upset that I had to find a new salon. I'm very picky about my hair so I googled tons of places before finding this place. All of the good reviews prompted me to go in. My first visit was the beginning of January and I saw Chelsea. She was super nice and at the time did my hair perfectly! I was so ecstatic since I was so worried I'd never find a place I loved again. Last week I decided I wanted to cut more off so I made an appointment with Kristy just to switch things up and so I could try both. Kristy is just as amazing, I love my new hair and I was so afraid to cut off as much as I did. I'll recommend this place to anyone near me looking for a good haircut. I haven't tried color here yet but I'm sure I will at some point!",positive
"The girls are awesome! Chelsea is very good at what she does. We discussed what i wanted and she didn't disappoint. She puts you at ease and talks you through the whole thing. She stops periodically to update you on the length and the cut. No surprises no tears . Kristie is so much fun to be around. The girls make a good team, i highly recommend this place.",positive
I made an apt because of all the reviews on yelp and I'm glad I did! Chelsea cut my hair and she did an awesome job! I have long hair and she understood my anxiety in cutting it LOL! She was very patient and really listened to what I wanted. Great place plus my hair looks AWESOME! Thanks Chelsea :),positive
I went there before a wedding last March. I had let my hair grow out for awhile in preparation for getting victory rolls. She made my hair look amazing and gave me tips for how I can try it at home!,positive
"I am three months new to phoenix. This is my second salon. This is my only salon now! Kristy worked magic with my really bad haircut. She gave me a great pixie cut that looks great and is easy to style! Can I just say I love it and ""thank you"" Kristy. ""It's so cute!""",positive
"After relocating to Sun City this was my second try looking for a new hair stylist. Well, I hit the Mother Lode.... Lol. Found Kristy on Yelp, couldn't be happier!!! She listen to my concerns and did a wonderful job, I have short, thick hair, I don't want to look matronly but yet I don't want to look like a 30 yr old hipster either.... Prices are great also. Thank You Kristy!!",positive
Kristy is amazingly talented and very personable. I just moved here and went to her based off of these reviews. It was worth it. She's excellent with short hair!!! She is my new hair lady.,positive
"Thank yooooou, Yelp! Since moving to PHX I haven't had anything done to my hair (blaaaah) & I came on here to find someone who could do a really good cut as well as ombre color. Shear Shack came up & I was able to make an appointment on her website which was awesome. I arrived & Kristy was as sweet as could be. I showed her a picture of what I wanted & discussed some concerns which she addressed & really helped put me at ease. Kristy was so friendly & we chatted the whole time, I love that I wasn't just sitting there in an awkward silence which has happened at other places before. I felt like we were old friends. She REALLY knows what she's doing! My color is great & I love my cut, it looks so healthy! To top it off, her salon interior is AWESOME & totally retro! So glad I was able to find someone who was able to accomplish exactly what I was wanting. I'm really looking forward to making another appointment again soon!",positive
"I wish there were more stars to rate The Shear Shack Salon. I love the results, and get so many complements from my family and friends. The Shear Shack Salon is such a classy little salon. Every time I go I get a great cut and color and blow out. This is not your average walk in Great Clips cookie cutter stylist. Kristy is the best. I even have my hubby going and she does a great job with his beautiful curly hair.",positive
"Shear Shack is by appointment only. Not that this is apparent from their website where business hours are clearly listed, but this is clearly the case as I was turned away today by the stylist because ""she was just stopping in today.""",negative
"OMG!!! Kristy done an awesome job on my daughter hair. I couldn't be more happier, she looks so stylish. I was a little nervous because she has short hair. So if you want the hipster look Kristy the one to go too. Thanks Kristy",positive
I love my hair! My stylist moved away and I've been looking for new person I could go to and become a regular. I have found that with Kristy. I am thrilled with my cut! I went in with no real idea of what I wanted I just knew I needed it cut. Kristy worked her magic and I'm so happy!,positive
"Finally! Someone who understands how to convert a brunette into a blonde. Kristy uses great products and knows exactly what she is doing. She does what YOU want, not what she thinks you should have. I love the way she listens and then makes it happen. I have a lot of hair and it is very long. She makes my hair look amazing time after time. I want just plain old blonde, nothing fancy and she doesn't try to do weird highlights or cuts. Though, she is capable of doing those different colors and cuts because I've seen her work on others. She is very versatile like that. Kristy can give you what you want regardless of what it is. I LOVE shear shack and recommend it to anyone!!",positive
"Kristy does the best vintage styles & updo's I've ever seen. If you are looking for an updo, vintage style for your wedding, prom, date or just because look no further than Kristy at The Shear Shack!",positive
Kristy R. is one heck of a stylist. I can't believe she has left Denver now I am left a hair orphan! She has always done a great style and cut and I would recommend her to anyone.,positive
I like going to a stylist to get my hair cut and Kristy is the best to go too!! She has a $5 off men's cuts on Wednesdays and that's when you'll find me there!!,positive
"You have to admit, its takes a lot for a guy to wander into a salon to get his hair cut in a place generally associated with women getting their nails done, do's did, and GOSSIPING ALL THE DAMN DAY LONG!!! But if you know anything about me, I got some seriously awesome hair. I mean we are talking Don Draper in his prime kind of hair. And it really takes someone special to get that right. Fade with a part to the side, little pomp in the front, and comb over. oh and LOTS OF GREASE!!!! This is barber shop stuff that local barber shops don't know how to do anymore! Kristy does it all.......... Instead of waiting forever to get butchered at some barbershop in the mall, swing by Kristy's place and get a cut that's quick, cheap, and high quality!! You can even book on the phone, email, or Facebook and not have to wait! She even sends email reminders for those forgetful soles (Me!). Regardless if its cut or color, man or woman, this friendly 1960's inspired joint is a one stop shop to get your hair did!",positive
"Best hair I've ever had! Kristy is so good I carry her cards around because people ask me how I get my hair to look so good! It's not me, it's my stylist!",positive
I get my haircut from Jenna. She is such an amazing hair stylist and the sweetest girl I have ever met. I also get my daughters haircut with her and she loves going there and her hair is always beautiful from the cut all the way down to the Paul Mitchell baby shampoo so it doesn't burn her eyes. 5 stars is the most I can pick but you will not be disappointed. Such a great family business. Adam R,positive
"I have had positive experiences at this salon in the past but Kim left sores in my head. I have been blonde most of my life and never recieved a chemical burn, been scalded by hot water (that I asked to be turned down), been told she was doing been a favor at the same time she is freaking out that my hair was neon yellow..... I could go on but won't. I wish she would have asked Tony for assistance as I requested. This bad experience could ruin my hair for years. I am sad and greatly disappointed. Please be careful with who you choose to touch your hair as getting the wrong color could be the least of the damage.",negative
At this salon you will find a hairdresser named Jeff Olivier and you will not be disappointed. He is your go to guy for hair color. He'll do whatever it takes to give you the best experience. And he's located at a salon that has the best atmosphere! You'll def be taken care of with the finest Paul Mitchell has to offer. Thinking of going from black to silver? I did and Jeff Olivier did not disappoint! Very friendly and personable and you'll leave there looking and feeling like a million bucks. A++++++,positive
I absolutely love the work Geoffrey does on my hair. He always has new and awesome ways to fix it. He colors and tones it perfectly every time!!! I always leave there looking like a million bucks!! Thanks Geoffrey,positive
"I highly recommend looking elsewhere. The stylist didn't listen to anything I asked for, I had to interrupt him 2 times while he was cutting my hair and say that's not what I want and he would just argue with me that he knew what he was doing. He clearly didn't, he messed up my hair and did whatever he wanted. The shampooing was the worst experience I have ever had I left with a head ache and a terrible hair cut. Find somewhere else!",negative
"Had the best experience here! The setting is super cute, I really love the rustic look. I had Kim who did an absolute amazing job. Kim, I've never been so satisfied walking out of a salon. Thank you so much!!! The staff are all really nice and friendly.",positive
"Today is my first visit, walk out with big smile, my hair stylist is Ms. Kim, she is very very friendly, very sweet and professional. I already make my next appointment with her. They are deserved 5 stars !",positive
"Kim is amazing. Took in a picture for inspiration and walked out with the look. I have very thick hair with curl, it requires a lot of time. Kim put in almost 2 hours into cutting about 3 inches off. She is amazing!",positive
"Wonderful place with caring and talented owners and staff. I came in here with an actual hair emergency. They stayed open late to help me and Kim did an AMAZING job. The other salon I went to first did a terrible thing to my hair and Kim worked a miracle and fixed it for me, way better than what I expected could be done. Wonderful atmosphere and you can tell that the staff is not only really good at what they do but they also love doing it.",positive
I moved here from out of state and was stressing out to find a great hair stylist. I have platinum blonde hair and have had many stylists in the past screw it up. I was scheduled with Jeffrey Olivier and he was amazing! I would highly recommend him. It was pricey but worth it because he didn't screw up my hair. He is a Master Stylist. Thank you Jeffrey! I also loved the atmosphere and everyone in their was kind and welcoming. I would recommend this salon to family and friends.,positive
"Tony and his high quality and professional associates are just simply the BEST!! If you want to feel and look like a movie star after a visit to your hair dresser, look forward no more!",positive
Tony is amazing! I haven't been so happy with my hair in years I'm so grateful I found him! He takes his time and know what he's doing. He and his staff are super sweet and everyone seems actually happy to be there unlike the majority of salons. I highly recommend him and would never go to anyone else!!! Thank you Tony!,positive
I just moved to Vegas and was looking for a new salon and someone I could trust with my hair. I saw pictures of Claudia's work on Yelp and checked out her instagram @lovelydisguises and knew I found the one! She is so sweet and works hair MAGIC! She is your girl if you want a gorgeous balayage.,positive
"I went and saw Cynthia C to get my hair done after I got engaged and she is the prettiest and nicest girl! I follow her on instagram and see how her work gets better with every client. The salon is very industrial and the whole staff is really friendly, they're always making sure you're okay and comfortable and they have a variety of drinks to sip on while you get pampered! My hair came out AMAZING and I can not wait to keep seeing her I recommend anyone with curly or straight hair to see her, she is confident in what she does and makes sure you are happy with the end result",positive
I've been getting my hair cut by Erica for about a year now and she always does an incredible job! Every time I come in she pays attention to details and makes sure I'm happy with how everything. Always super friendly and outgoing with a big smile.,positive
"Love everything about this salon. Great vibe, everybody was super friendly, (Claudia) @lovelydigsguises who did bayalage on my hair was amazing!!! (Pictures on her Instagram) I will definitely be back!",positive
"I have been taken care of by Claudia for the past 4 months and everything from as soon as i walk in the door to the moment i have to leave is a nice experience. I have to say getting my hair rinsed and my scalp massaged was a pleasant surprise, since i went from going to super cuts to the comfort of Barbershops, i remember telling her i wanted to skip it cus i didnt want to pay extra for extra services, but surprisingly this came at no additional cost. This is at another different level to what i am accustomed to and a totally different experience. I needed my hair to be ready for a wedding and ever since i started going to Tony Moreno's, Claudia set up a plan for me to get the goal of my desired hair lenght and style. Every time with each visit my hair would look and get better and better Ive posted a couple of pictures of the wedding day because thats how happy i am with the work. I really dont see myself going back to any other place. Plus the price difference is not that different. Also the Salon has unique look and feel to it. All the stylist are very welcoming and nice. You have to be there to believe it..",positive
Definitely a 10 on every aspect of my experience... Claudia is very professional Will definitely recommend her to all my friends and family.. Thank you Claudia!!! Love my hair..,positive
"I only ever get my hair cut here, i'm always happy with the way my fiance's hair turns out. All of the employees are friendly and inviting. Tony Moreno's is much better than those shitty $5 chop-shops and worth every penny. And they have the skills to back up their beautiful establishment.",positive
"Don't let the orange hair scare you! Michi is amazing! All the reviews are true, if you're looking for someone who LISTENS and gives you exactly what you want, Michi is your girl! I had to look for a new stylist, mine retired at an ripe old age of 25 to be a stay at home mom (I'm not bitter, lol) I have long straight hair and most stylists jump to wanting to chop it all off or cutting more than a ""trim"". I talked to Michi about it and you can tell how passionate she is about hair and exceeding her clients expectations. She made subtle suggestions and can be as creative as you allow her to be. She mentioned that creativity comes in after she understands your boundaries, which I can totally appreciate! We spoke about some of my impulsive styles that pop in my head every once in a while, like bangs or a soft wavy perm and she gave me advice, her thoughts and honest opinions and next steps if that's what I wanted to do. What I appreciated was that she said she'll question bangs and make you question it before she'd actually agree to doing it. Having just had a baby, she made good points and we decided not to do it. Because my highlights had grown out and not having a lot of time to maintain my hair (newborns don't like to wait for a 3 hour hair session) we decided on low lights and doing My version of a ghetto ombré for lack of words and she gave me a classy, beautiful blend! She also did an extra step to give me more immediate results (which exceeded my expectations completely) I also told her I'm a low maintenance hair person and she suggested texturizing to prevent knots. She's sure to tell you what she's doing every step of the way so you are aware of what she's doing, which makes you feel super comfortable! I put all my trust in her to do her thang, whatever she felt would look best and my hair looks amazing. Listen people don't go filling up her schedule so that I can't get back on the books! But I can't keep her a secret because Las Vegas deserves to know that she's hiding out in southern highlands and is a true orange gem!! And contrary to my mom's description of her, It's not tattoos, it's just make-up!",positive
"This is a 5 star business that provides excellent customer service from the second you walk through the door. I have very fine, thin, and blond hair. Basically, a styling nightmare. Thanks to Jenna, I now have a stylish cut that is easy for me to take care of. I'm glad I was referred to Jenna at Tony Moreno about a year ago.",positive
My hair was in such bad shape. I went in for just a hair cut . Kathleen did such a great job on styling and cutting my hair . I decided to go back and get some color and high lights .I am so happy that I found a great place to get my hair done,positive
"Someone recommended Jenna to me. She is one of the worst hairstylist I have ever had. I told her that my hairstylist in Venice, CA used to add some green to the color to neutralize red tones. Jenna simplified this by coloring a layer of my hair to light green. Now, after many months finally the green color is barely noticeable after my new stylist colored it over many times. Jenna thinks that customers want to have a hair color like a clown: pink, black, green etc. Horrible colorist who makes very expensive mistakes. She also did not do my low lights correctly as the right side of my hair was not even close to the low lights on the left. I did go back to have the low lights fixed but I figured she was such an inexperienced and horrible stylist I would never trust her to fix the GREEN tone of my hair. Awful job, should not be licensed!",negative
"I came here to get a cut and I loooove the staff, they are soo hospitable. My hair stylists really listens to what I want and gives me great feedback ( not Attitude). I also come here just to get my hair braided for busy weeks of being a mom, hard worker, gym rat ...etc. I have not got my color done here yet, and if and when I do I'll be sure to post it ! I can't give 5 stars till I get that done and see how it goes.",positive
Same day appointment for a wash and blow dry. Did a great head massage with neck too. Great service and convo. Got compliments.,positive
"I was starting at a new location with my job, and thought to myself now is the time to set yourself a part from the rest. After many years of thinking I am skilled to color my own hair., I reached out for the best after my failed a tempt to reach my younger California surf days. I was lucky to have walked into Kathleen life's, who seemed to share a lot of the same journeys as mine. She really connected to me, all though our age is at least 10 years apart. Kat was amazing she gave me the full experience of what stylists should do.. I believe and continue to believe. Thank you Kathleen for not only giving me the confidence to conquer my new job, and making me look good. But somewhere between it all I feel I gained a friend",positive
"My hair was hacked by someone who I thought knew what she was doing with bob cuts so I let I grow a couple of months and then went in to the Tony Moreno salon to have it fixed. Michi was my stylist and she did a fantastic job! I didn't think there was much that could be done to make it look better as it grows out, but she managed to give me a much better look without taking off very much length! I left the salon feeling a lot better about myself because my hair was no longer crooked and weird looking",positive
I've been coming here for a few years now. I've followed Tony from salon to salon and I'm glad he opened up his own place. The stylists are excellent and professional. I've had haircuts from a few of them and have never been disappointed.,positive
This is the BEST salon ever and Tony is the absolute MASTER of hairstylists! I have been a client of Tony's for 8 years and everyday I get compliments on my hair. People are amazed that it could be sooo blonde and sooo healthy/silky soft. I recommend this salon to everyone and I will never go anywhere else! Thank you Tony for making me look amazing!,positive
"The new location is wonderful. So big and open and much easier to find. As soon as you walk in, you are offered a beverage. The staff is awesome. Jenna, my stylist, is nothing short of amazing. She is so talented and creative. She can do anything with hair. She always has great suggestions too. While the salon is a bit pricey, you get what you pay for.",positive
"My first visit at Touché with Audrey. So very happy with my cut and color that I've already booked my next two appointments. I've been searching for the perfect place over the last two years. Truly believe I've finally found it. Great atmosphere, totally comfortable salon. I live in Scottsdale but can get to this location in Fountain Hills in 20 minutes. What a great way to start my day. Highly recommend!",positive
"Looking for an expert in gray hair? I'd like that blend it, or make the gray and nice blond tone so as it grays, it blends. Please send me pics as examples. Thanks.",positive
"This place will leave you transformed. It's both a casual and capable professional salon. Audrey, deserves the praises of us all. She has exquisite skills and I walk out with great hair and receive endless compliments. Aveda products, too. This is an oasis in Fountain Hills.",positive
"Touche Hair Design is the best salon in the valley! The staff is great. I get my haircut from Audrey and she is amazing! I don't live in the same area but my 30 minutes drive to get my hair done by Audrey is absolutely worth it! She can turn a worst disaster into a masterpiece. She definitely cares about her work and makes sure you leave the salon feeling and looking awesome.She listens well,makes suggestions and gives you feedback. People consistently give me compliments and tell me, ""Wow, that's a great haircut"",""Where did you get your hair done from?"",etc. I can definitely say I love my haircut each time I visit Audrey. Do yourself a favor and give this salon a try, you won't be disappointed, in fact you won't go anywhere else after visiting Touche Hair Design.",positive
"When I moved to Fountain Hills from Chicago I had to give up my hair dresser of 25 years. I was devastated. By chance I walked into Touché Hair Design with photos of what I wanted in regard to the perfect haircut just for me. ""My wind blown look."" I found Violetta, (Violet). She listened, looked at the photos and I left with the best hair cut I have ever had. I mean that. She is perfect. Plus she is happy and fun to talk to about anything. Patricia R.",positive
"Touche is an amazing place with many talented hair stylists. I highly recommend requesting Kim Brown when you call or walk-in. She's very experienced and I've been working with her for 3 years, she's amazing, talented and so considerate! Everyone there is so sweet and inviting, you certainly won't regret choosing them. It's a very relaxing environment.",positive
"This was my first visit to Touche. It was wonderful. My hair was a disaster prior to Audrey working her magic with my cut and highlights. The atmosphere of the salon was very peaceful, I immediately felt at ease. I would highly recommend Touche!",positive
I have been a customer of Audrey's for several years. I only go to touché and Audrey to get my haircut now. She is very professional and talented. I have sent several friends to her who have complimented me on my hair style. They are always happy they went and now get their haircuts and styling only with Audrey. Touché is an Aveda salon with only quality products. The salon is comfortable with several seating areas.,positive
"IMy experience with this salon was really great! I was able to get a wonderful stylist (Audrey), she was a true perfectionist with my hair. She took the time to really get to know what type of length and cut I wanted. (even brought over a few books to choose the bang length),... I had originally called due to the fact that they carry Aveda products and she was really informative with each item. Also washed my hair in the Aveda products I was originally calling about so I was able to really experience the products first hand. I would highly recommend this salon if you are looking for a salon with skilled stylists.",positive
"Having a bad hair day?? Look no more! Touche Hair Design can make your day better with a new do, great music, and sensible conversation! Audrey ""fixed"" a bad hair cut from another salon with ease and assurance. She listens to her customers needs and offers professional advice to enhance your hairstyle. Definitely try this shop out! I'm stylin'in Fountain Hills, Az",positive
"Love how my hair turned out. She actually listened to what I wanted and gave me a few suggestions before doing a color, cut, and style that turned out to be exactly what I was looking for.",positive
I always feel welcome here & I get tons of compliments on my hair. Maytee works her magic & voila! Beautiful!!! Thank you Maytee & True Essence!!!,positive
"This is absolutely the best place to get your hair done! I drive 45 minutes just to go here. The service is excellent and I always leave with the best hair. They do scalp and hand massage, and hot towel wrap while getting your hair washed. Reagen has magic hands! I have never gotten more compliments, even from total strangers. It is worth the drive from anywhere!",positive
"I thought this place was great before, and great just got even better. I still love everything I loved in my previous review, and my haircuts and color are the best I've had anywhere. But I just visited yesterday and they've got a cool new guy working there named Sam who washed out my hair after Maytee did my foil, and he gave me a super relaxing scalp massage (totally free). It was excellent enough to make me want to find this review and mention it in a update. And you know, I think it's these extra little touches in addition to the superior level of hair artistry that really make this place special. BTW, if you're checking out True Essence for the first time, Sam said he is taking new clients.",positive
"I had the same hair stylist for years, and a few months ago she moved to a different state. I was terrified. A friend of mine recommended Sammie, from this salon. I have been going back to her ever since! She is fantastic! She is friendly, professional, and really has a good idea of what hair will work best, but can also replicate anything brought to her. It is not cheap- But well worth it. I would recommend Sammie (I have never been to any other stylist) to anyone!",positive
"Update: My regular hair stylist was in a car accident and I found myself scrambling for a last-minute appointment, and calling every hair salon in Mesa. I finally found a place with an opening, not realizing that True Essence was the salon I had sworn to never go to again. I thought I had called the salon across the street, and it wasn't until I was at the intersection that I realized my mistake. So I sat in the parking lot, debating turning around and driving home or going inside. Looking at my hair in the rearview mirror, I decided I rally didn't have an option. I had to keep my appointment. My appointment was with a stylist named Sammie, and she was excellent. She made some suggestions which I went with, and the color came out looking great. I got highlights and low lights and it looks natural, and the color goes all the way to the roots. I couldn't find a single strand that wasn't perfect. I even gritted my teeth and made a future appointment to see her again. Sammie's work was definitely five stars, but with the previous issues I had, I can't go that high for an overall score. I still believe there are issues with the lack of customer service and the failure of the manager to respond (I waited over a week before posting my previous review to give them a chance to contact me and rectify the situation), but if I can see Sammie without having to deal with them, I'm OK with that.",positive
"I have been going to True Essence Salon for over 6 years. Maytee always does an amazing job on my hair. I am very particular, as most of us are about our hair and she has always gone far above my expectations. I can trust her to try something different on my hair or do the same thing I have done for a year, she just seems to know what I'm thinking! I highly suggest trying out the salon, you will not be disappointed.",positive
"My neighborhood go to salon. Receive consistently good service - haircuts, massage, and an occasional pedicure. Front desk is friendly - greeting you when you come in, offering water, and efficiently checking me out. When there are problems, Maytee does everything she can to make it right",positive
"I made an appointment at the True Essence Salon for a ""base break"". The appointment resulted in golden/orange roots that the stylist spent a long time trying to correct with a toner. The stylist told me that I can call and come back if I still feel like my roots are too orange. During check out it turned out I was given the wrong service, a color touch up which bleached my roots instead of a base break. When I left the salon and saw my hair in daylight and later in my bathroom light I was very unhappy with how it looked. My roots looked orange in contrast with the rest of my neutral highlighted blonde hair. It looked cheap. I even received negative comments at my work. I called the salon and spoke with the manager. After explaining what happened she booked an appointment for me with an experienced stylist and told me that the corrective procedure may require more time then a base break normally would and that this will be free of charge. When I came in the stylist told me that she would need to add few highlights to the base to neutralize the orange and that this will not be free of charge. I asked to speak with the manager. This time the owner Maytee Green came out, not the salon manager I spoke with. I explained yet again what happened. Even though she seemed to understand what happened she told me that since the correction is more time consuming then just a ""base break"" I would have to pay to get my hair fixed. I tried several times to reason with her but she told me to leave her salon. You shouldn't charge someone to fix what you screwed up in the first place!",negative
I am very disappointed with this salon we came in with a bridal party of four plus the groom came in a little later. As soon as I walked in the stylist was very rude I did not wash my hair because the mother in law of the bride had set our appointments for wash and style. I told her I needed my hair washed and if I knew it was going to be a big deal I would have washed my hair before I came. She argued with me and then washed my hair very fast said she didnt have time for anything but to blow it out. Then I get into the chair and i asked her if she could curl my hair with the extensions she said she could not. They are clip ins it would have taken five minutes. While all of this is going on the stylist that was doing my sisters hair the bride was laughing like it was funny. So I said this isn't going to work if you arent going to do what I want. I'm not going to pay someone to blow out my hair I can do that myself. I am the maid of honor I needed to look nice. So she said ok i walked out with soaking wet hair and had to drive around to 5 other salons to find someone that would take the time to do my hair the way I needed it done. I just got married myself && have had never had a problem like this we had a party of 7 with extensions and hair washes that just came up in a last minute deal.I understand not having the time on an ordinary day but not a wedding day. The customer service part of it was just very rude the bride was very upset I was almost stuck doing my own hair. Please be aware we didn't even get a I'm sorry from the stylist. A wedding day isn't a good time to be a rude person.,negative
"Do not buy the $10.00 Aveda club card. When I went to pick up by birthday gift which expires at the end of February, they would not give it to me because I did not renew my card. Waste of time and waste of money.",negative
"Now maybe I was spoiled by the other Aveda Salon I went to when I lived in Washington, but I feel like charging $30 for a blow dry when you're already paying $65 for a hair color is RIDICULOUS! I made an appointment here to touch up my hair color because my roots were starting to show. I had the color ""recipe"" from my last stylist so I wasn't worried about trying to get the color to match. When I called in to make the appointment the lady I spoke to was very nice and friendly, I did think it was strange at the time that she kept checking to see if I wanted my hair blow dryed, I was used to it just being a standard service after your hair was washed. When I got to the salon the day of my appointment the receptionist was on the phone and didn't greet me. I stood there for a minute before she finally greeted me and asked if she could help me. I told her I had an appointment and who it was with so she said she would tell the stylist I was there. Then she proceeded to keep sitting there talking on the phone about how her son couldn't pull money out of his bank account but she could see that there was money in there!! I was not impressed. The stylist finally did come out (probably thinking I hadn't shown up since no one notified her that I was there) and she was very friendly and welcoming. I gave her my color combination and she seemed to understand it right away, even commenting on the shade which put me at ease that she knew what she was doing. There were just two things about her that kind of put me off. She talked a lot about travelling all over the world and going to different Aveda events and learning different techniques which is great, but it almost felt like she was trying too hard to impress me and then she commented at the end that she had done it all out of pocket and that Aveda didn't pay for it. It was almost like she was name dropping countries she'd been to. The other thing I didn't like was it seemed as though she was trying to shove products down my throat! She asked if I used any Aveda products and I told her I did use several. Now maybe that was my fault for admitting that I use the products, but the WHOLE rest of the time she kept telling me about probably 20+ different products that she recommended for me. I'm sorry but I really don't want to be discussing what kind of exfoliator I use while you're washing the dye out of my hair. Then the final straw was when she asked if I wanted my hair blow dried or not. I paused for a minute because I still thought it was strange for her to ask as I'm sitting there with my hair dripping because I just expected it to be a normal event. She then informed me that it was $30 for a blow dry. I told her that I didn't want to worry about it in that case so she offered to ""kind of"" brow dry it just so that it wasn't dripping when I left. Thanks. I love it when I leave a salon after getting my hair done and it's frizzy and fluffy because you just shook a blow dryer around my head. Normally when I get my hair done I leave feeling hot with a little more swagger in my step. When I left True Essence I immediately put my hair into a pony tail to try and hide the frizz she created and ran home to fix my hair. Not exactly an indication of a great hair experience.",negative
Came to this location yesterday for the new Becca bronzers called ahead and a very nice lady answered the phone she was just soooo nice and put what I wanted on hold. Got to the store ended up getting two more Becca products (this always happens to me) turns out the girl that was ringing me up was the one I talked to again suuuuper friendly I tried reading her name tag I think it said Jenny? She was amazing! The only two things that were annoying that I noticed with this location only are 1. Understaffed cashiers 2. This location puts these obnoxious security tags on their high end makeup that beep so freaking loud every 2 minutes me and other customers were standing like just beeping our lives away! and if you get too close to the door ( and by too close I mean towards the fragrance area) the alarms on them go off so loud you would think I was trying to steal Ulta's soul But other than that had a good experience thanks to Jenny!,positive
"Horrible customer service. Tried to be as easy going as possible about one of my items breaking during shipping. Was told they would not replace the one item, would not order a new one because it's out of stock, won't let me know when it is in stock and ultimately said too bad here's your money back. Sephora hooked me up though with 5$ off just for dealing with Ulta, at least they show customers they appreciate them. Won't be back.",negative
"Went into the store last night for two black eyeliners and left with a bunch of other stuff-- but what else is new when going into Ulta? Anyway, Shannon was super helpful and answered all questions that I had in a friendly and happy manner. Thank you Shannon for assisting me in finding a bunch of new products, it was much appreciated!!",positive
"I try, I really do. I simply never have a decent experience at Ulta. For instance this time I called ahead and wanted to make sure the specific Nars item I was intending on purchasing was in stock before going there. Note, I was running errands and figured I would swing by and scoop it up. Well... I called m, held and waited. Waited so long I preceded to simply drive there. 21 minutes- I'm still on hold and waking into Ulta. The store, which I was still on hold with. Two employees were standing in front of the Nars, just them no customers. Please insert an emoji, rolling my eyes might be suitable. Searched for the item, luckily one left. Yes! Still on hold. 26 Minutes, as I walk over the line. Line, always a line of at least six individuals. I hang the phone up, wait touchscreen hit the end button;) Two cashiers, and not the two who were simply chatting by the NARS section. Waited on the line, yes, I clearly timed it. 15 minutes, give or take twenty seconds. I try about three times a year with Ulta, and always similar experiences. Store is never quite neat and tidy, as for the help well I will refrain on that. Sephora rules.",negative
"Avoid the salon for ""blowouts"". My hair going in and coming back out after a ""blowout"" service looks exactly the same, except with a lot more product's perfumed in my hair.",negative
"Warning this is going to be long. Sorry! I come to this ulta all the time because it's pretty close to me, it's clean, and Nicely stocked. I work in a hotel on the strip so hospitality and costumer service is a big thing to me. And the people that work here have awful customer service. The lady at the cashier counter greeted me when I walked in ""welcome to ulta!"" It was very nice. My birthday was in 2 days so I needed a new brow pencil. I had plenty on time and I love browsing, so I'm in the urban decay section, looking at the heat palette and one employee asked if I needed anything, I replied "" oh no I'm just browsing for now just looking at this new palette"" and she said ""if you need anything just ask."" Not in a very happy tone almost like she forced herself to say it. I said "" thank you I will!"" I see a man sitting by the little table next to the urban decay on his phone. In my mind he's just a guy waiting for his girlfriend, I look and move on. Then as I'm walking around about 5 employees ask if I need anything. I again tell each of them no I'm just looking around in this section. And we all move on, then as I keep moving up sections the same employees asked me about 10 times again if I need anything. I was getting kinda annoyed. So I said "" no no I will ask if I need help, thanks."" I'm still trying to be nice. Then I finally get the Anastasia section for my brows, pick my color and then I was looking at the lipsticks. And again the same employees kept asking if I needed anything I said "" no. I'm fine"" and I said it kind of moody so they could know, no im fine please let me shop in peace. Back to the guy, he had passed me a couple times, again I'm thinking he's just killing some times for his girlfriend or whoever. And as I'm walking the employees kept hovering over me, so I moved into the NYX section and not one employee came up to me. But this guy was next to me and I was very confused because I looked around the store and all the other costumers where new (as in they just walked in) so it finally clicked to me, this isn't some guy just waiting, he's the security in normal clothes. I know I look kinda young but really I'm not some rebellious teen. If you have something to say, say it. I put all my stuff down walked to the cashier and said you have the worst costumer service I've ever seen. And I left. I'll still come to this ulta because it's close but I'll never browse again.",negative
"After going to a location off of Rainbow and not finding what I needed, I came to the summerlin location. I love everything about this store and if I every need any other beauty products, I will defiantly return to this location. The women who helped me check out, was multitasking and helping other customers while still giving me undivided attention.",positive
"I don't know why there's so many negative reviews, compared to other ulta stores this one is always clean and well stocked with stuff for the most part. I just come here to pick up makeup and beauty needs haven't had my makeup or hair done here. I never had an issue with staff being rude and I wouldn't prefer to go anywhere else.",positive
"I have not been to ulta in months. I was so excited to come in today and shop from all the brands I don't find at Sephora. I started to grab new goodies and put them in the basket. After 15 minutes someone approached me. It wasn't really a friendly approach more like a ""are you stealing"" approach. Before I knew it there was loss prevention lingering by me and a call over the intercom saying ; ""loss provention please watch over cameras 1 & 2"" I felt really uncomfortable.... why couldn't you customer service me and ask if you could hold my purchase at the front? I've worked in retail (Sephora) and this is not how you handle a ""suspicious "" looking person. I got in line and paid for my purchase over $200 while a loss prevention waited for me right by the entrance... ok. I'm a 24 y.o. Woman who happenes too look like a teenager, I get it. But I'm a hardcore shopper and I love makeup and having the consultants show me new goodies and talk to me about it. Maybe if I got that service BEFORE you had me followed and watched. Very turned off by the lack of service . Not going back, I don't even want to support this company any longer. Not professionals. I felt very uncomfortable as the staff stayed in the background talking only among themselves.",negative
"No hi, hello, or how are you. Every single time I come in here, I am literally a ghost to EVERYONE in this store. I'm so sick and tired of this store and I am never coming back again. Even though it's more convenient because of distance, I'd drive else where to get away from the shitty service you guys provide me every single time I come here. I come in looking for Smashbox Photo Finish Water Primer. The lady in the very front of the store doesn't even greet or look at me so I go straight to the Smashbox aisle. I see that there is none. I see an employee pass by and I ask her ""is there any more Smashbox Photo Finish Water Primer?"" All she says is ""No"" as she keeps walking away from me and DOES NOT make eye contact with me at all!!!! I understand you're busy, but at least a hi would work. I am absolutely fucking tired of this store and its shitty service! You guys don't even deserve one star! Ulta should be a place where someone should be able to de-stress and shop for makeup. But no, all you guys do is make me feel unwelcome! This store is pathetic and such a disgrace when it comes to customer service, I am absolutely done with it! I'll make the drive to Town Square or the Rainbow location instead. Until these employees pull their heads out of their snotty asses, which they probably never will, I will never be coming back to this location.",negative
"Went to this location close to opening time. A lady and I waited for 15m for someone to help us. The staff that was there looked disinterested and avoiding us as we patiently waited for them to finish whatever it was they were doing. Totally Avoided eye contact to acknowledge us. I couldn't wait any longer as I was pressed for time. I moved on from makeup section to hair products. Finally, someone from the salon asked me if they could help me after 10m of searching. She was very nice and friendly but not knowledgeable enough to give advice on the hair product (she was a stylist in the salon). It's hard to google also due to Poor connection. So I picked up an item that was familiar with and got outta there. Will have to check out Sephora in the department store in Summerlin which is a bit inconvenient but at least I won't be ignored.",negative
"They emailed me a coupon for $25 haircut and style for first time customers so I booked an appointment online. I had an appointment with Heather at 1:30 pm but I forgot I had to be somewhere so I booked another appointment online at 5:15 pm with Liz. I called in the morning to cancel my first appointment but no one picked up. I tri d to confirm my 5:15 appointment later after calling a few times. Someone picked up after two tries. I came in at 5pm and sat at the salon. After 5 min a guy finally acknowledged me and checked me in. He said Liz was busy with someone but she'll be done soon. I waited till 5:30 and no sign of Liz. I stood up and told the same guy that I have a coupon from Ulta and asked if that was ok. He had an irritated look on his face and asked if he could see the coupon. He said it was fine after looking at the email for god knows how long. 5:50 still nothing from Liz. I got up and told the guy that I have to be somewhere so I'll just leave if she can't accommodate me. He gave me an attitude and said ""But I already told her you're here"". I said politely, I understand but its already 5:50 and I haven't seen her yet. He gave me an irritated look and just said ""ok"" with a rude tone. I walked outta there and had not been back since then. First off, I came 15 min early. Never heard from the stylist. And waited nearly 50 min the store. And somehow I was given an attitude because I had to leave. Wow great customer service Ulta!",negative
"My first ""real"" facial and all I can say is that she did a wonderful job!! When I first walked in I did not think much of the place there were no greetings at all. Which is what I would expect of an Ulta. After being in the store for about 15 min Zendaya came over and told me about there facials which were 30% off!! What a deal! $18.90 for a facial is great with all of the other $60-$100 facials that may damage your skin. My skin is glowing and feels great! I will definitely do this again!! Thanks Zendaya you rocked! The other in the store could take some pointers!",positive
"Rachelle at the Salon at Ulta Beauty is so awesome! She did an amazing job on my makeup and hair, and she has a great personality. I showed her a picture of what I had in mind for my makeup, and I loved the makeup application. Just like the picture I showed her. She explained all the products that she was using, and she introduced me to some brands that I will soon be buying (Julep lip color, Laura Gellar lip scrub, De-slick, and Naked products to name a few). She gave a great classic blowout that showed waves and volume. It was raining today, but my hair stayed in place all night for the event I attended. Thank you, Rachelle!",positive

"I can't say this was this store. I bought an ULTA gift card through their on-line program and never received the card even though the charge was processed by my VISA. ULTA refuses to assist, saying it's a cash star problem. I have two phone numbers for cash star 844.249.2086 (from their website) and 855.741.1209 (from ULTA) and both ring and ring - no one answers, nothing goes to a call queue, They got a lot of financial press from Forbes, etc., but I have to wonder if they have gone out of business and simply absconded with everyone's Christmas money? They sent a response to get a status and sent the link: http://Liquid error:undefined method 'split' fir nil:NilClass"" which, of course, doesn't exist either. What's up, guys, and how do I get my $50 back???",negative
"ULTA Beauty located in downtown Summerlin is a nice place to buy cosmetics, hair styling products in addition to designer perfumes and colognes. This location has a very friendly staff and the store is nice & clean. I have encountered Christina on couple of occasions and each time she has offered excellent customer service and has helped me find what I'm looking for. I believe the customer service may be best at this location. That's why I prefer this store. Its that time of year as far as holidays go and for me this means stockings to stuff. I have always been quite pleased with the selection here and haven't had any problems finding what I am looking for being in stock. Of course if I waited to the last minute it could be a challenge, fortunately I have had the time to get here before the last minute shoppers. ;) The colognes and perfumes are priced accordingly and are comparable to any of the Department stores. I highly recommend this location for most of your beauty supply needs. :)",positive
"This review is for the Ulta Salon! I had the most amazing experience! I had never been to the Salon before so I booked with caution from the other reviews, but I was pleasently surprised! My stylist was Caroline and she was so sweet, gave me great tips for my frizzy hair, and left me with a beautiful haircut and blowout! My hair is soo healthy and soft now! I booked my next appt. right after she finished my hair. Highly recommend Caroline!",positive
"Heather Vaughn is absolutely amazing and the only soul I trust when it comes to my hair. My hair has been screwed up before in the past and heather is my GO TO GAL!!! I had made the mistake of using box dye and completely fried my hair and had it 2 different colors. Heather worked with me to remove the box dye, do deep conditioning treatments, and glaze my hair back to a color similar to my natural color. They are reasonably priced and do an amazing, amazing job. Positive vibes throughout the whole salon and the work is just flawless. Pics to follow.",positive
"Got my haircut here and it was an awful experience. I usually got to another ulta location, however I was in the area and decided to try this one out. The girl who cut my hair was very young (probably in her 20s) and treated me like an idiot. Granted, I am a teenager but this girl couldn't have been that much older than me. She constantly made comments about how damaged my hair was and how my hair care routine was all wrong. I understand as a stylist she knows more about hair than I do, but come on you don't have to be rude about it. I asked her to give me a little bit of layers to take some weight off my thick hair but not to make the layers too short. She made such short layers in the back its embarrassing. My hair is so uneven i've spent the last month keeping it up because its blatantly uneven. My left side is longer than my right, the front and back are short while the middle (chunk of hair beside my ears) are long. It looks awful and I do not trust this ulta to ever do my hair again.",negative
"My fiance bought me Too Faced's Semi-Sweet Chocolate Palette for my birthday, and with it came three sample sized Too Face items: Better than Sex mascara, Born this Way Foundation, and Shadow Insurance primer. I was super excited to try them all, but when I opened the box for the mascara, it was empty! Determined to get my item, I called around the Ultas by my house to see if they could help me. All of them simply told me they were out of the item, and could not do anything. When I called this location, I spoke to Joanne who was actually concerned about the fact that I received an empty package, and promised to help me even though the original purchase didn't even happen at this store. When I arrived at the store, a different employee helped me get my replacement (I don't know her name, but she worked the register at about 4 pm!) She searched all over the store, high and low, and profusely apologized for my empty package. She finally found one in the back, and quickly exchanged mine out. I truly felt the customer service was exemplary here, especially since they were the only store willing to help me (not even the store we purchased the item from would help us!) If this location was closer to me, I would definitely return. But, for now, I highly recommend it for it's outstanding customer service!",positive
Worst color I've ever had! I left there with flaming orange roots and silver ends. The foils are so stripy too. She completely ruined my hair! I asked for my money back and will never return. They need to give their stylists some serious education!,negative
"This review is actually for Stephen at the Ulta Salon in Downtown Summerlin. The Ulta itself seems like other Ulta's, just what you would expect, in a nice location. parking kind of a pain but near other shopping, food etc. I have come to get my hair done twice. I took a chance as I'm new in town and wanted a specific service that Ulta offers that I have a harder time finding other places (accent highlights) I have a couple of photos on my instagram and have already told all my followers to go see Stephen. I recently took the photos of my hair down cause of all the weird men following me (I suspect as a result lol) so that's pretty good advertising but I figured a review over here on Yelp might be better :) I have light hair but it can be resistant to highlighting. I appreciate Stephen got me the right blonde color, no brassiness, no red. nicely woven, no toner needed, fun to talk to. I'm extremely picky about my hair and would not have gone back otherwise. Ulta is also a professional salon compared to some others I have researched in the area which can mean a real lot in the end in terms of feeling comfortable or in case something goes wrong (it didn't for me just something to consider when deciding to go somewhere new and in the sea of groupons and independents floating around in LV)",positive
"Today was my 1st visit to Ulta Salon stylist Ashley. She is absolutely wonderful. She took very good care of me, consulted with me every step of the way, and we called my former stylist Vernon, to make sure all the procedures were accounted for. I am so luck 1st time out, my hair looks fabulous and I look forward to going back in the next 6 weeks.",positive
"I am mystified by the bad reviews about this location. The store manager, Sita, who has helped me on more than one occasion, is friendly and has outstanding customer service skills. The staff has always helped me with the best makeup choices, are a pleasure to work with, and help me arrive at good choices for me. I've even had to make a few exchanges lately (which is rare), and they cheerfully took back the used products with with I was dissatisfied, and helped me find alternative products that work for me. I cannot recommend this location more highly, and I've been shopping at Ulta in Las Vegas for many years. So pleased they opened this location at Downtown Summerlin.",positive
"Hello I am writing because I am livid with my experience on 8/10 shopping at Ulta, located in Downtown Summerlin in Las Vegas, Nevada. When I arrived yesterday afternoon at around 4:00 pm. I was taken back by the customer service and how the store General Manager Marney made me feel. Upon arrival I was immediately followed throughout the store by Marney. I was not asked if she could assist in any way. Her first words for me, was ""Don't touch those makeup Brushes""! She commented how they are not meant to be taken out of the clear showcase glass. If I am going to purchase the item, I want to feel the texture, material, etc. I was not taking it out of the pre - packaged item that was for sale. I was holding and touching the sample. She followed me througout the store and made me feel like I was a thief. She judged me the minuted I walked in to the doors. I was followed throughout the entire time after she alerted the staff. I was so upset as I have NEVER been treated like this in my entire life. After I had made my purchase asked to speak with her and told her how she made me feel. She was very rude and told me ""I follow people all day""! I can tell you not to touch those makeup brushes as they are samples not to be held. I was in complete dismay and utter disbelief! I have been a long time shopper with you. I will take my business else where and advise all of my professional colleagues and friends of my horrific experience.",negative
Clean store. Greeted upon entering. Very nice staff. Helpful when I called looking for a product and kept in on hold for an hour at the register until I could get there to pick it up. Electronic coupons no problem; they scan it off the phone. Products grouped by brand.,positive
"Received a blow-out and style at the salon the other day. Not impressed. The shampoo/condition used cold water and the chairs were so uncomfortable that my neck was in pain. Then I sat with wet hair at the stylist station for 10 minutes while she shampooed another client. This was annoying because I wanted a blow-out during my lunch break and was in a rush. The blow-out was no better than I could do myself, although my hair was very soft so that was a plus. But at $36 with a $10 off coupon, the blow-out was definitely not worth it. I would pay maybe $10-$15 but definitely not close to $50. High-end salons don't even charge $50 for a blow-out. The reason for the 2 stars instead of 1 was that everyone was very sweet. My stylist was pleasant and the manager was very sweet too. However, for $46 for something I could do myself, I will not be back.",negative
"I went to this location to get my hair cut. When I walked back to the salon the guy greeted me. He asked me what I was there for. When he went to get my stylist, I could see them both talking. He pointed at me and the girl rolled her eyes! I felt very uncomfortable the whole time. I'm not sure if that's how you operate your business. But I'm totally not going back to this location.",negative
"Worst Ulta I've ever been to. The person working at benefits brow is racist! She knew I had an appointment and was waiting right by the counter for almost an hour, I did not get any greeting or even acknowledgement for my presence. She continued on chatting with the girl she had on the chair and taking her time. It was clear she did not want to serve me. I've been going to benefits brow for two years now and go every month. This is by far the worst I've experienced. It's like they opened up another branch and put the worst staff in there! I doubt this branch will make much money given their service level now",negative
"What an amazing salon! I live in the UK and was visiting my family in the area. I'm so glad I found this place. I came into the salon desperately needing a change. From the front desk to the assistants to both of the stylists that I saw, my experience was fantastic. Ronaldo & Sadie really know how to wow their clients. Sadie was my colorist and she was absolutely amazing. She took her time and really perfected my color. Coming in, my hair was damaged and brassy but leaving Sadie's chair my hair felt brightened and healthy with the exact color and tone I requested. Ronaldo cut my hair and I absolutely love It! He took time to discuss hairstyles that complemented my face and fit my lifestyle and recommended a brilliant cut. It is one of the best cuts I have ever received! Both Ronaldo & Sadie were incredible professionals that took their time and really perfected everything. I will definitely be returning when I'm back in town next year!",positive
"First time customer yesterday at this North Central neighborhood salon, and couldn't have been happier with the results. I have very thick hair, which Renaldo took his time working with to understand the texture before cutting. I'm sold, this is my new salon!",positive
"First visit and haircut today. I have been in search of a hair salon that felt welcoming. I have found it. Sadie and Ronaldo, owners, are very congenial, fun and open. Sadie cut my hair and she took her time to understand my needs/wants. I have hair that was way too long (almost to my waist in the back) and needed to be cut. She did an excellent job of layering my hair and she cut my bangs, the best anyone has ever cut them. I asked for choppy, uneven, edgy. No one ever understands what I mean. Sadie did! YAY! I look forward to a new haircutting adventure with her during future visits. The look of the salon felt very New York, cool, sophisticated and still welcoming. Price was perfect.",positive
"Sadie and Renaldo are two talented stylists that understand our cult-like obsession with our hair. How it looks affects how we feel. Not to sound shallow, but a good hairstyle + haircut + haircolor = a good day!",positive
"Sadie is a true professional! I'm so glad I discovered this place! She knows how to get the color and tone right the first time. Very friendly and the environment is open, modern and relaxing.",positive
"poor results in the lash lift. lashes are barely even lifted, let alone curled. all other salons offer lash lifts that actually curl the lashes for a cheaper price but this place will guarantee you that the basic lash lift (lower end of the two types) will not work on most people. do not go",negative
"Update: I went to a reputable shop for Phi removal of Unyozi's horrendous microblading. The Phi technician commented that she could not believe how deep Shirley had gone when she did my microblading (and commented about how uneven my brows were by saying ""did she even measure you?!""). She said that my microblading would have definitely been **permanent** due to how deep Shirley went. I had suspected this given how little success I had had with my own attempts to fade them. It will likely take another expensive, painful removal procedure to get rid of what Shirley did. What a nightmare.",negative
"Can't say enough positive things about my experience with Shirley at UnYozi. Very clean and pleasant location, and Shirley is incredibly friendly, patient, and informative. She did an awesome job on my eyebrow microblading and I will definitely be back!!!",positive
"I did a microblading service for mens with Shirley and it was absolutely worth it. She assured me about the results, the duration on which it heals varying amongst people, and was very professional about it. I would be aware that it takes a bit of time for it to settle in and that if you have any events or special occasions, to plan it afterwards in advance to avoid the awkward ""cartoon eyebrows"". Definitely would recommend buying the product for the post care, it works very well and I haven't ran out of it yet even after a month. Be patient with it, take care of your brows afterwards and it'll turn out great! Mind you this was a 2 month process, it will vary amongst each individual!",positive
"First of all, let me start by specifying that this is with regards to a Groupon on which I had the misfortune to lose all of my money. Bought a misleading Groupon from this business. I immediately booked an appointment online and received a call a few days later, asking me to cancel that same appointment seeing as apparently ""the therapist wasn't available"" (weird! Your online booking said you were!, but anyway). This could be a technological glitch. They happen.. so I didn't say anything. She sends me a text message with my appointment details. About 5 minutes prior to my appointment, I receive a text message from her again, telling me her unit number and buzzer code. ( Uhhh.. what??)..Of course I show-up at this place, which I thought was a studio, only to realize that this is to occur in a private residence. (Of course, no research that I performed online indicated or that this was done from a private home. I mean, there are no pictures anywhere online indicating this. not even on this here Yelp listing!) URGH..I thought, but It's not like I have any other choice now, I mean Groupon has a 3 day cancelation policy for a refund, and wit this rebooking thing pushing me way over the deadline, there was no way I could get my money back from them, so I proceeded anyway.. Seeing as I was already soured by all this, I was immediately put off by the setting, and also by the misleading Groupon and decided not to go thru the procedure, as having received 14 tattoos in the past, my personal experience dictates that trust and comfort are a MUST. This goes for a tattoo which you can SEE being done.. much more a FACE tattoo.. BTW.. for those of you who think you are getting a 'deal' on your eyebrows, you are not, as while most (ALL) other microblading providers do give you a free touch- up, this woman will charge you the same as a microblading session for EACH touch-up, so in the end, you really are not getting any type of discount, at which rate, you are better off going somewhere else, with a better atmosphere and setting. My 2 cents anyway! Ah well, too bad I lost my money, hopefully this will help you not lose yours!..",negative
"I got my eyebrow microblading done by Shirley at unyozi beauty and had an awesome experience. The first time I met Shirley was at the consultation, where she took me though the whole process and I showed her pictures of the brow shape I wanted, which is was how I filled my brows in myself for years. She wasted no time by drawing out a shape that was best for me. Originally I wanted to follow the natural shape of my brow, which slopes downwards, but she recommended a different shape to open up my eye. At first I was nervous, but I trusted her professional opinion and am SO GLAD I did! She applied a numbing cream and used a laser to numb to brow area. I was surprised that in less than 5 mins my brows were numb-then she started to microblade. you can hear (but not feel) it. By the end of the procedure I couldn't feel a thing! I haven't had my final touch up yet, but am loving my new brows so far and am confident the final product will only be better. I am so glad I went to Shirley for microblading, as her knowledge and experience definitely show. Her concern is genuine, and I think that's very important when letting someone perform this kind of procedure on your face. I highly recommend going to see Shirley if you're thinking of microblading!!",positive
Shirley did an amazing job on my lashes! I had them done last week and they are still going strong! Definitely recommend her over about 5 other places I have been!,positive
I had my lashes done by Shirley a week ago. Overall I was very happy with the experience and the results. Shirley was very professional and the studio had a very relaxing atmosphere. I requested to have more natural looking extensions and Shirley really listened and worked with me to find the right length for my eye shape. After a week the lashes are still looking great and don't require much daily brushing if any.,positive
"Had a great experience with Viva Blowout, my girlfriend absolutely loved the treatment and I loved the price. I would highly recommend them if your in Las Vegas.",positive
"In Vegas for a holiday family reunion and stayed at a resort off the Strip. A friend of mine recommended Viva Blowout for getting my hair done and I am so glad I took up her suggestion. Booking was super easy and I loved the convenience of having my hair done from the comfort of my hotel room. My stylist arrived at my hotel room as scheduled, was friendly and did an excellent job. My blowout was just as good as the ones I normally get at my local Drybar in LA. The cost was comparable to the other competition when you factor in the convenience of not having to travel, wait time and tip. Highly recommend!!!!!!!",positive
"Love the convenience of having someone come to my room at Aria, this past Saturday. Crystal was a pleasure and everyone complimented my ""do"". Thank you!!",positive
We had Viva come to our pre-party this weekend and they did a great job! Everyone looked beautiful and it all went smoothly and on time! Makeup and Hair! Would def recommend and use them again.,positive
This was my first time trying a mobile makeup and hair service and I must say Caron and Sue made my first experience a very pleasant one! They were both very professional and did an absolute great job. I will definitely be booking Viva Blowout again on my next trip to Vegas.,positive
"Just got my hair done with Zanet, this is totally the way to go in Vegas! So convenient, the stylist comes to your room, with all the products and tools. Very professional, friendly, great service! Highly recommend it! And the cost is a fraction of the salon downstairs in the hotel! Thank you Zanet and Viva Blowout. Will definitely use your services again!",positive
"I loved Viva Blowout. My blowout was great. I received so many compliments and my stylist was very professional. I was a bit concerned to allow anyone in my hotel room but after getting rave reviews and a personal reference, I decided to go for it. The price was right and the experience was great. i will definitely use them again.",positive
"My brother and now sister-in-law got married last week in Las Vegas. I wanted to get the bride something special for her wedding day. I'm so glad I found Viva Blowout online. She was so happy with her hair and makeup. The big day was a big success! From the moment I called Viva Blowout, they were up front, responsive and answered all my questions. I found the pricing fair as well, especially since they came to the bride's hotel room which was super convenient. I would 100% recommend them and use them myself if and when I need this type of service in Vegas!",positive
Zanet arrived a few minutes early. Did a great job for me and my friend . She did exactly the style that we asked for quickly and efficiently . She also had a great kid personality !!thank you Viva,positive
"My company held a beauty bar during CES and reached out to several companies with similar services. From minute 1, Viva Blowout was responsive, and quick to provide information. They immediately won our business which was servicing over 20 woman who wanted to get glammed up during a busy time. We had 3 hair stylists and 2 make up artists who were all STELLAR, and our clients could not have been happier. Every girl left feeling beautiful, and it was SO much fun. I would hire them again in a heart beat and will be referring them to every single friend who is heading to Vegas for an occasion. Thank you!!!",positive
Was so happy to find these guys last minute and book hair and make up. So convenient! The stylist and make up artist were both amazing. Recommended it to all my friends and will be using Viva Blowout again.,positive
WE spent the weekend in Las Vegas for the HWY 91. Viva came to our room on Friday and Sunday to do our hair. Blowouts were great. We will use again...,positive
"Me and my friend has booked blowout services last Saturday night at 9pm so we would have the convenience of blowouts in our hotel room before going out that evening. I had specifically called ahead of time to ask if extensions were extra, and were told they are not. When the stylist got to our room... 20 minutes early... without texting or calling to let us know she was coming early (Luckily I had showered) midway through the appointments she informed us she came early so she could get to another appointment and then asked my friend to pay $20 extra for her extensions. When I politely pointed out we had called ahead and asked, she said it was up to the stylist however the website clearly says no cash is exchanged. I then texted the unknown person at Viva who I was coordinating with and asked her if we had to pay extra, she replied with a curt response informing us we did not. I then had to ask her to please reach out to the stylist and inform her that we did not have to pay extra. She did reach out to her, but never followed up, apologized or anything. We then had an extremely awkward encounter with our stylist who said that her boss informed her ""we did not want to pay"" and that she would get reimbursed on that end. Super weird and awkward...",negative
"This was my first trip to Vegas, and Caron definitely delivered! She was prompt to the hotel room, and finished me and my friend's hair right on schedule. We were there for a work conference, so we had to get our hair done at 8 am, but it was still perfect hours later. The picture I took was actually taken 12 hours later, and my hair was still looking exactly as she had styled it. Definitely worth it. Next time I come back I will definitely be booking with them again.",positive
"I can't say enough about Viva Blow Out. I booked them for two consecutive days for hair, makeup and lashes. They were on time, professional but super friendly and best of all gave me two completely different looks each night. Each look was fabulous and I got so many compliments. I am definitely booking them for my next stay in Vegas!",positive
"Caron and Nikolina did my hair and make up respectively, for my wedding. They were fantastic! Punctual, efficient and really good at what they do. Two thumbs up! :)",positive
Love the text verification including flexibility when I was running late! My hair came out PERFECT. Thank you so much!!! will definitely use Viva Blowout during our next stay.,positive
"I did a spray tan and Hair and both girls were wonderful! On-time, professional, and they did a fantastic job! I will use them every time I'm in Vegas.",positive
"I was getting married in Vegas and needed someone to do my hair for the big day! I immediately thought of Viva Blowout because I used them the last time I was in town. I only had a few days in Vegas before the wedding and Viva was able to book me with the same stylist the day of and the day before for a trial run! The stylish completely understood what I wanted with little direction! They were also able to book another stylist to do my bridesmaids hair for the wedding! Their prices are much better than other stylists charge for wedding hair! My bridesmaid and I all looked amazing the whole night, even throughout the rain! Definitely recommend to anyone who is getting married or wants to be pampered!",positive
"Was in town for business and didn't want to fuss with my hair, enter viva blowout! Came to my room at 7:30am and gave me an amazing blow out and styling! When my hair wasn't big enough from the blowout they curled it, teased it and I was thrilled with my big, beautiful hair. Highly recommend them!",positive
"What a great concept! Used this service in Vegas, and didn't have to worry about packing any hair products/tools, or doing my hair the whole trip. My girlfriends and I had Laura come to our suite and she was fantastic! We were able to hang out with everyone getting ready as opposed to leaving to get our hair done at a salon. The price was fair and well worth the convenience and being able to go out with our hair on point!",positive
"The service they offer is the best thing I ever discovered here in Vegas! I'm so glad I found Viva Blowout and would ask for their services the next time I'm back in town. My stylist Chelsea was on time and very sweet during the whole service, which was greatly appreciated. I showed her a picture and it was beyond my expectations. Thank you so much Viva!",positive
Highly recommended with five stars! I came to Las Vegas for a Sales Conference and wanted to look my best and looked for a salon to get a blow out and found Viva Blowout. The best part is a stylist comes to your hotel room so you don't have to go out searching for a salon. What a fantastic business and I'd like to do a shout out to Sam for great service and making me look gorgeous and polished in 35-40 min. It was easy to book In my mobile phone and the owner texted me the morning of my appointment to walk me through how to allow the stylist to come to my room Highly recommended and thank you again Sam!!,positive
Chelsea was great! Arrived a few minutes early to my hotel and did a wonderful job styling my hair. She was even nice enough to deal with my business call interrupting the blowout a few times (sorry!). Would highly recommend using Viva. It's easy to book and having them come to your room makes getting a blowout super convenient. Definitely worth the cost. Thanks!,positive
Just received a wonderful blowout in my hotel room during my business trip to Vegas! Scheduling my appointment online was totally painless (the team even graciously accommodated 2 time changes due to my work schedule) and my blowout looks perfect. Super professional- and so amazing I didn't have to step foot out of my hotel room during the whole process. Highly recommended.,positive
This is a review for the wonderful customer service. I was booking a group of blowouts from another city and was so impressed with the Viva Blowout team. They were responsive to my emails and kept in constant contact with me through texts and calls. They were able to accommodate my needs and the booking and payment process was very easy! Thank you for all of your help!,positive
"As my trip to Las Vegas approached, I kept nervously checking the weather. I have hair that when not blown-out ends up as a giant, frizzy curly mess. The predicted temperature was 105. Amid my growing panic, I started searching for a blow-out place. Viva Blowout came to my rescue. They accommodated my 7am call time (I had a day of meetings) and even came to my hotel. Zanet arrived a few minutes early (one of my favorite traits in people) and proceeded to give me an excellent blow out. She was fast, professional and did an excellent job. I would highly recommend this service. Now we just need to get you guys to come to Chicago!",positive
"Slam Dunk!!!! Best service to come to Las Vegas I guess wishing on a star really makes dreams come true! Samantha is very good at her craft and she is fun and witty to chat with, she can move in with me!! Thanks Viva Blowout!!",positive
"I used Viva Blowout for my birthday weekend in Vegas and it was everything that I hoped it would be! My stylist, Zanet, was amazing ... she was always on time and really took the time to make a hairstyle that suited me. One day I went curly and the other I went straight ... I absolutely loved both looks. I would highly recommend Viva Blowout to anyone who wants to have a stress-free hair day in Vegas. Will definitely use them again :)",positive
"I am new to Las Vegas from NYC, and I definitely am one of those annoying people that says, ""it's good, but it's not like NYC..."" Yes, I am that person! Last week, I hesitantly booked a blowout from ViVa Blowout expecting a subpar experience compared to my beloved ex-city. Cue the harps! In walks Samantha, bubbly, friendly, fast and fantastic. She listened to my hair woes and was patient when I detailed the exact way I like my bangs parted and laying on my forehead (thus is an exact science!) I am happy to report that it was BETTER than my last few blowouts in NYC! Yes, I am eating crow, pass the ketchup!",positive
"WARNING - If I could give a negative rating I would. This woman does not know what she is doing when it comes to tape-in extensions. After removing my extensions she was too lazy to remove the old tape and put the new tape on the old tape, then proceeded to use a hot iron melting the tape into my hair. The subsequent removal took almost 2 hours to complete with massive amounts of hair being ripped from my scalp. After 2 hours there was an incredible amount of adhesive still stuck in my hair whilst she proceeded to explain to me that this was typical for tape in extensions, which it is not. I spoke with manufacturer about their products and tape has a cold bonding adhesive and is NOT to be applied with heat as this will melt the adhesive into the hair and cause the damage I have described above. It was incredibly painful and has caused serious damage to my hair that will take years to grow back if at all. PS hair colour has nothing to do with this.",negative
"Been going here several times and have to say she is one of the best hair-dressers. She is very attentive, helpful, pleasant and treats her customers with respect. A true professional! have reccomended her to others!",positive
"I wish I could give a higher rating. I have been seeing Joyce for almost 10 years now. She is the only hairdresser I have ever remained loyal to. She is the only one in the city who knows how to make a weave stay for months in Caucasian hair. She is giving and cares about her clients. She always checks up on me to make sure I'm happy and she has never ever disappointed. I have sent countless people to Wavelength Hair Studio over the years and they all rave about their hair! Anyone who gives this salon a bad rating clearly has an axe to grind- or they are on drugs (hey, it's Yonge Street.) Joyce is the best at her craft in the city. I've never met anyone who comes close to comparison.",positive
"I'm going to begin my review by doing something I rarely if ever have done... by defending the honor of a true professional and wonderful lady. I was shocked and appalled when I read many of the reviews posted here about Wavelengths Hair studio and later in my review I will address these concerns in greater detail but first my experience at this salon I recently decided to make the change and go with fusion extensions instead of having to clip in my extensions every time I needed long hair, which turns out to be a lot with the work that I do. So I began to research my options both online and by phone; believe me I spent much time gathering info and comparing salons but Joice stood out immediately as she was one of the only ones who would quote prices on the phone and the only one who provided a variety of options, catering towards quality but affordability. I called back many times with a barrage of questions which she answered politely and efficiently with a keen understanding of the care and consideration something like this takes. I eventually decided to go with one of the options she presented me with, which was to go buy my own hair (which would work out cheaper) and she would apply it. She quoted me a very affordable price and was accommodating schedule-wise so I set my appointment. The salon itself is located on a little side street called Irwin with surprisingly ample parking as there is street parking and underground public parking just up the street. Small but tidy and quaint this is a full service hair salon with the specialty in Hair Extensions. As soon as I walked in I recognized not only the voice but the generally warm and friendly vibe I got from speaking with Joice on the phone. I came in with a bang, almost knocking over a mirror and chair in my clumsiness but she was her bubbly and accommodating self and made me feel right at home. She explained to me the process and some info about care, maintenance ect.. but as she proceeded she noticed I had bought pre-bonded keratin packs, which she informed me wouldn't be the ideal option so she went with a shank method that was MUCH more expensive but because she quoted me a certain price on the phone she actually honored that. I was SHOCKED! Not only that but she really knew her craft and how to work the best she could with the materials provided. Throughout it all she was conscious of price and quality even making the move to space out my extensions because I had only bought 100g though she made it look full and natural. My hairstylist even went out of her way to compliment the job and I have trusted her opinion for a while now as she has saved my hair many a time from silly dye jobs and wacky cement hair styles. Joice even gave me a clip in highlight cause I was asking about pink highlights, really the generosity was incredible! The whole procedure was no more then 2hrs in total, prob not even that and it was a pleasure to sit and chat with such a kindred spirit like Joice so the time passes by even quicker. After it was done I couldn't get over the feeling of the hair it was amazing! So light and natural looking... blended perfectly and was literally invisible even with my hair up . The salon itself also offers a fantastic incentive for referral too, any guest you refer gives you 15% off your next visit now I have never heard of that before. She also gave me a very reasonable deal to remove them when it comes time and if I do choose to get them redone it will DEFINITELY be here!! Now I have never done this before but feel compelled to call out the two resoundingly negative reviews I have read here because I feel Yelp is a place for people to find TRUTHFUL, HELPFUL and HONEST reviews not petty, childish attacks at a business and persons reputation. These businesses are run by human beings that deserve the respect of decency and making personal attacks publicly and using yelp to slander or berate someone is not what this site is intended for. We as reviewers have an obligation to not only be truthful and respectful but be mindful of the consequences of our words as these are peoples livelihoods we are affecting after all. So if your going to leave such a negative review/rating be sure to give ample reason and try to remain objective.",positive
"I went to Joyce for weave hair extensions. She is really good at it. She was recommended to me by Cosmetic World - 623 Yonge St. My hair didn't pull and felt completely natural. I got tons of compliments. She also put great highlights in it. Joyce seems to be quite experienced with extensions and more importantly is creative. Also, I took hand-woven hair and she knew all about how to work with it (different from machine-weft). She is nice and listened to what I wanted. Just work with her and you will get a good result. Also I found her salon to be very comfortable unlike the typical rushed, hectic and sales-like atmosphere of other salons. Make sure you do your own research on where to buy your hair to get the best-looking and quality hair - Joyce will have suggestions as well, and from what I understand she will start to carry her own supply. She seems to really know what good quality hair is, but as to where to buy it you must do ur own research ! Note: She does it differently than other typical hair weaving places - her website says she specializes in Caucasian hair for weaving and that would seem to be true. I gave 4 stars because ""Yay! I'm a fan."" I will reserve a 5 ""This is as good as it gets"" for when I have been there enough to really know that. I am really happy with what I got.",positive
"WARNING - The owner threatened to sue me again today (Feb 2018) since the last threat (mid-2017)... I logged in after a long lull, planning on deleting mean girl reviews I wrote during my teenage years but srsly?? Be careful if you're a walk-in, don't you dare voice any concerns to Joyce, her first response will be ""You just see who gets the last laugh when I take you to court for libel!"" Just told her to stop perennially threaten me with court orders over this review (I really was considering taking this down if she changes her mind)...but nope. She insists she'll take me to court. - - - - - (2010 experience) Ever want to get royally shafted?!? 3 cut & up'do's, in a 3-hour appointment slot (set up 2 weeks ahead of time). 7 hours later: - my friend's highlights turned GREEN: they blamed it on the fact that she didn't tell the stylist she sometimes dye her hair with drug store hair dyes. - I didn't get my haircut because they spent the whole afternoon trying to fix my friend's hair (and FAILED). We were late for the event because it took up 7 HOURS. We sat there from 2p.m. to 8:45p.m.. We came out with a handful of company logo-emblazoned cosmetic mirrors, ball-point pens and lip balms as souveniers. Luckily my boyfriend got his haircut first (1:45p.m.) and he wasn't expecting anything other than a crew cut. And I am glad our up-do's were creative ones; it was up, thick and fierce, and has some structure to it. Looked like we were the only clients that entire day. There's no way they're convincing any of us to fork out $950 for Cinderella Hair Extensions. We were nice clients, they were nice people but obviously the stylists need to go back to barber college.",negative
"After having such an unfortunate experience at Whitehouse the first time, I was contacted by both the manager and owner to apologize and invite me back. This kind of dedication to customers is not often seen and I was struck by how sincerely they wanted to make things right. So I went in to get my hair and nails done and had such a great experience. My hairstylist did such a great job listening to what I wanted but also offering great tips. Easily the best haircut I've had in a while. Jimmy did my nails and he was wonderful- really great attention to detail. Overall I would say this salon lives up to all of the recommendations I was given- and will highly recommend to others!",positive
"I had a haircut appointment with Lacy today. She is one of the art directors at the Whitehouse Salon, and the title encouraged me to leave aside my trust issues when it comes to trusting a new hair stylist. And I should say I'm glad I did so! I showed Lacy some pictures of the hair cut I was envisioning, and also explained to her how I wanted my hair to look like and feel like, and boom! she gave me a beautiful layered haircut with lots of texture and natural movement. I'd definitely go back and I'd recommend her!",positive

"The staff could not be any nicer. Conversations are great, atmosphere is great and the cuts are second to none in this area. They really go above and beyond to create a welcoming environment. Rachel is my stylist and have never received a better cut.",positive
"This place is amazing. My last few haircuts at other local establishments have been terrible, but Wise Guys is a cut above the rest. I was promptly greeted upon entering the establishment and made to feel welcome. Their wide array of services were tailored to my specific requests, as Nadine and the staff were extremely accommodating. In the end, I received a great haircut that both my wife and I love. I will definitely return!",positive
"Came across this place while traveling for business. Wish there was a place like it where I live. The facility was clean and stylish. Nadine, the owner, was my stylist. She was friendly and gave me a great haircut.",positive
"As a man who cares about their appearance, a hair cut completes it. With a friendly staff, nice layout, and clean facility this place is great. Very professional staff who gave me a great cut. The only reason I give this place a 4 star is because I scheduled an appointment for 6:30 and the man in front of me who didn't have an appointment somehow got in the booth before me. Although it it may have been a simple mistake due to our names bring too close, They were 20 or so minutes late to get me in. I assume this will only happen once and that it was a simple mistake. I highly recommend getting your haircut here if you realized that great clips or any of the amateur chains we're butchering your dome. They provide 5 star haircuts and service and I plan to be back as soon as I need another cut.",positive
I've dropped in on this place periodically when traveling on business - it is now called Wise Guys. This is a great place to get a haircut with a lot of different services provided at reasonable prices. Scalp massage and hot stone neck massage are amazing stress relievers and was told they do a great facial massage. Radine was my stylist and will definitely book her again.,positive
I have had the privilege of having both Rachel and Nadine cut my hair (and my son's hair) over the years. They are both amazing stylists! So excited for their new salon!,positive
