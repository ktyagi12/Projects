Looking for the best tactical supplies? Look no mas. Police? EMT? Military? Civilian? Come to 5.11 and get your gear on!,positive
"Stood in line like an idiot for 5 minutes to purchase 2 pants and was ignored by 2 cashier's (One was doing inventory on a paper or something and the other unboxing somethings). Probably because how I was dressed and my skin color, I like being very comfortable on my days off. I throw my things on the counter and walked out. I will gladly take my money else where.",negative
Another great store with quality Equipment. The staff is super friendly and helpful and was able to help me find what I was looking for quickly,positive
"The Problem with this store is not that they have AWESOME customer service. It's not that their entire staff is absolutely FRIENDLY. It's not that their inventory is AMAZING, it's that I can never choose just one thing so I end up buying what I NEED and then just come back to buy what I WANT. It happens to me all the time I go there! I'm the, ""just take my money,"" guy when I'm there. See what I did there [insert devilish smile]... But seriously, I mean every word of awesomeness that I said. I'm already a huge and loyal fan of 5.11 products but it's the overall customer service and experience the staff provides and believe me, from the moment you walk in until the moment you walk out, without fail, you will be greeted, welcomed, asked if you have any questions, reminded that someone's always there for you, assisted, and overall satisfied and confident knowing that the experience will never change every time you visit and shop at their store. You can tell that 5.11 seriously cares about their patrons and customers by selecting the best employees to staff and represent their company! Way to go 5.11! You guys are awesome!",positive
Great place! We went in at almost closing time and we didn't feel rushed to purchase. The employees were knowledgeable and friendly.,positive
"Love this shop. the employees are incredibly friendly and patient with all o our questions. there's a large selection of men's and women's clothing. it's great to be able to try things on before purchasing, Even though the 5.11 catalog is extensive, it's sometimes hard to tell how some things will fit. My wallet is always a bit lighter whenever I leave the shop.",positive
"I'm with others' who tried to exchange something and were not able to. I spent nearly $600 on three pair of pants, three shirts and two belts. The pants that I bought had an expandable waistband which I did not see before getting them home. They didn't fit right from the start, then I noticed the waistband. I can't stand expandable waistbands. I'll take them to a tailor/seamstress and get them altered. They are very nice but when you spend that kind of money out of your own pocket and have a problem, you should be able to exchange them. The manager I spoke with was very professional and I could see he sympathized with me but there was nothing he could do. He did say they were having a big sale after Thanksgiving and YES! I'm going to see what they have. Rick C. Be Safe Firearms Instruction Las Vegas, NV.",negative
"Have bought 5.11 tactical shirts and pants on line and have been very satisfied. While in Las Vegas, my wife and I needed waterproof jackets to go whitewater rafting in the Grand Canyon. They had a great selection of everything including the jackets and we were quite pleased. Staff was very helpful and knowledgeable. Nice quality as expected an I was bone dry. Although I will continue to by online, I will shop here every time I come to Vegas.",positive
Everyone here is very nice and patient and when there is a sale they recommend the sale rack and recommend new items and free promotions !,positive
"I've bought products from this store online as well as at Bass Pro shops so you can imagine how happy I was when their own retail store opened up two years ago. Located off Dean Martin Drive and the Interstate 15 between Flamingo and Tropicana, the store is on a relatively central location off the strip. All the retail staff are knowledgeable and you can tell they believe in the high quality products they sell. They have clean fitting rooms as well as a wide selection of women's and men's apparel as well as tactical accessories. Keep a lookout for deals as I took advantage of their discounts during father's day weekend and other events. I like how this location now not only carries Yeti products but also has carries the high quality coffee brand that is made by military veterans. I literally walk into this store twice a year and spend a couple hundred dollars and am more than satisfied.",positive
"We had an awesome experience here. Karlie and Nessa (Vanessa) helped us a ton. We came in with a list and they knew exactly what he needed. Vanessa grabbed pants for him to try on and by the time he knew what size he needed, Karlie had already pulled everything else we needed from the shelves and was ready to ring us up. They had a few items that weren't in stock, but Karlie ordered them and we'll be able to pick them up as soon as they come in. She packed all of his items into the bag we purchased to make it easier to carry. She went above and beyond customer service by casually chatting with us while we browsed, sharing advice, and even telling me how to wash the pants we purchased. This was an awesome experience-we will definitely be back!",positive
The store is ALWAYS clean and organized and the team is on it. Thanks again Karlie for all the product knowledge and help!,positive
"Took advantage of their awesome Fathers day sale last week and spent a bit to get a lot of good deals! The staff were VERY helpful! One thing I can say is ""I'll be back!"". If I could make a suggestion, it would be to have a few shopping carts for tactical gear junkies like myself. I had to clutter their countertop with all of the items I was purchasing that were on sale. I think I actually used up all of their shopping bags on my purchase. Thank you, Las Vegas' 5.11 tactical store staff!",positive
"Karlie and Caitlin are awesome, every time we come in they are extremely knowledgeable and courteous. Great to deal with and we always leave happy",positive
"I attempted to exchange my comically oversized shirt and wasn't able to since it had been washed. If you have expensive merchandise in a poor location, you'd better damn well have excellent customer service if you hope to keep a loyal clientele. Good luck with that.",negative
"I was in need of a 1.5 inch tactical belt. I don't remember the girl that helped me but she suggested I size up. Thank god I did, the belt is perfect. I got the 511 trainer belt. Service was excellent. I will be back for a Qalo ring, and a new backpack soon. Thank you 511 tactical!",positive
Awesome customer service everyone of their employees went out of their way to make sure we had no questions and found everything we were looking for. The merchandise is killer. Can't beat their prices. Very clean and and well organized.,positive
"Although I have yet to meet Gage for myself, my husband particularly likes working with him to find what he needs and what other range employees need when he comes here. Usually John is never adamant about that kind of thing, but because he has mentioned it, I know this guy must be great. I came here the other day to look for some shoes I had seen online. Unfortunately, they didn't have it. However, I know I can order them from the store. Sweet. I ended up swooping a pair of pants though. I appreciate that they have a changing room, too. This isn't a dig on the store itself because it's not their fault, but some of the women's 5.11 products are pretty lame. Why don't they make anything in multicam or OD green for women? The shirt graphics are also a little corny. Maybe I'm just not tacticool enough or something. But they DO have their CCW bags and a full length mirror you can check yourself out in to see how you like it. This last trip up, customer service was great from the guy. The female was standoffish and definitely wasn't as nice to me as a few of the other ladies that walked in before me. She was happy to mention discounts and sales going on to them, but not to me. Oh well. I'll remember that next time and ask someone else for help if I need it.",positive
"Great selection, yes the prices are high but they mainly only sell 5.11 products which from my experience are of the highest quality. I had a issue with water getting into the leather on a tactical boot that I bought there they replaced it with out any issue. Staff is knowledgeable and attentive. Only problem is I can't get everything I want when I'm in there.",positive
"This place has all sorts of 5.11 goodies. Unfortunately,they have some serious issues when it comes to customer service. I picked out a number of items and went to the counter to get rung up. Not a lot of stuff, less than $100.00. For some reason, the cashier asks for my name, 'for the receipt'. Fine, I give it. They ring the items up, and I prepare to swipe a Visa Vanilla Cash Card, one of the ones you get with no customer name on it. The cashier says 'before you swipe, I need an I.D. Well this is something I have NEVER had asked when using these cards. There is no need for these guys to see your I.D. I decline to show, mostly because it is outside in the car. Cashier says' I need to see an I.D.' At this point, I have had enough. I guess they do enough business to turn people away, and I am very suspicious of what they are going to do with my personal information. So I tell them to get a clue, and walk out of the store. So all in all, don't bother, just use the internet.",negative
The staff is really nice and the clothes are great quality. They didnt have any sales though so your gonna be paying alot of money.,positive
"The customer service is amazing here. I literally downloaded this app because of the compassion towards there customers. I came in needing some new work pants. Not only were they more then willing to help, but they were extremely knowledgeable on there product. What really got me was I had recently just purchase a pare of pants from them several months ago. They were made 3 months old an the inseam of the pants. Long story short they took care of the issue. Mind you there not cheap product, but they have the best product an they stand by there name. If u ever happen to come in make sure you speak to Austin, Gage, Karlie. They are marvelous.",positive
I've purchased pants online from 5.11 and I really love them. I didn't know they had a store here in town. Went to check it out. They have a pretty big selection and all sizes including long inseams on pants. I mostly looked at the women's stuff. I was liked for gym shoes but didn't find what I was interested in from their online store. No worries though. When I need pants it will be nice to be able to try them on before buying. The employees were super nice. I was created right away and they were helpful. I ended up only buying a hat since I mostly just came down to check the place out as something interesting to do...but it's a kick ass hat haha. I'm be back for the pants later.,positive
"Great selection of high quality merchandise for outdoor activities such as camping, hiking, and exploring. Their outdoor clothing and backpack selection was exceptional along with a nice military grade boot inventory. The staff is absolutely fantastic, very personable, polite, and helpful. I would absolutely recommend this place for your outdoor activity needs. Enjoyed the experience at 5.11 Tactical.",positive
"I showed up a bit before noon on Saturday 9/17. I didn't expect to get any help as I figured that would be a busy time of day. Anyways, I had absolutely no intention of getting anything. I just needed to figure out the correct size I needed in a pair of their pants. (Work was going to buy them). Well, the staff was beyond helpful. I decided to look around and got a few things because of how great they were. You can tell that the crew working that day liked each other and their job. I'll be back. I wish customer service was always this good.",positive
"Great place. All the employees were friendly and eager to help. The prices were very low compared to Calvada or American Shooters. The only thing was I wished they had more of a women's selection for tops, but what can you do.",positive
"Not a bad place if you like 5:11 511 or 5:11 lol they definitely have a decent selection of commonly needed items and offer knowledgeable service on the carried product but because it is a corporate store and corporately trained . what is lacking is the customer service and attention to detail that you get from a mom and pop shop so if you like all the flash look coolness....go here.. to me the service is better at other supply houses that also offer you other brands of non clothing items so it can be a one stop shop with complete service for all your needs instead of running all over town 4 common items that you need . it appears that they are trying to open all their own stores to pigeonhole out the little Guy from carrying their product. it comes across as pure greed!! To be honest the last two pair of shoes / duty boots I purchased fell apart extremely quickly if the quality of the product keeps going down and they seem to just want more money ....proper seems to be making a better product these days, and that might be the route we will have to go .this does tend to cater more to the civilian market who like to look operatorish . lol they did not even have patches that were not made by 5:11 it is the equivalent of going to a 511 Walmart I hope they care enough to take note",negative
"This store has every single piece of 5.11 gear and a bit more. Friendly people and pretty good prices, 5.11 prices are the same everywhere you go. They also had specific 5.11 Las Vegas tee shirts too. Very cool!",positive
"This store is awesome has everything you want and more for both gals and guys!! The quality of their merchandise is amazing, the customer service is out of this world and the employees are always so nice and so knowledgeable!! Perfect place to get the perfect gift no place like it!!",positive
Lots of people standing around talking about what they did last night. Not one person asked if we needed help at any point in our 30 minute visit. Why so many employees? Are they strictly cashiers and not supposed to greet and help out customers. Lame,negative
I have tried to skate this place several times but it's always closed. It would be nice if they were open for people who skate on the weekends.,negative
"I had skate here many times and everyone is so friendly and the park is really good. The staff will offer to help you out for free some times and I gotta say, I learned a lot from those quick lessons. If you don't have a board you can rent one for super cheap and the admission is also really cheap. I will continue to come back here and skate I love this park!",positive
There is no structure to their lessons. A lesson could have one kids or six. Many times the teacher gives little to no attention to your child. We tried to talk to the owner and left voicemails and wrote emails...no answer.,negative
Great Skate Park for the whole family. Great people. Staff is amazing. Thank you for making such a great environment.,positive
"Great facility run by awesome people. My son never touched a skateboard before this week and within 30 minutes he was dropping in. He's a good athlete so all results won't be the same but the teacher is good, knows his stuff and loves what he does. If you got a kid who skates or wants to learn this is a fantastic place to check out.",positive
"Very nice and clean indoor skate park. The young man that helped me was very informative on the going ons of the place. Came in looking to get items for a young skater,he took the time to help with what I would really need and not what I came in for. Some would say that that's a salesman but when he talked me out of spending 100s,when all I needed was 35,that's a tru person of the sport. I will be back for more.",positive
"This place is awesome! Just a very friendly and positive environment that is great for all skaters, especially the younger ones! Clean and spacious with reasonable prices, not much else you can ask for. My younger brother loved it and I'm sure all skaters would!",positive
Indoors for the AZ Heat and coaches such as myself to help influence the next generation of skateboarding. Come in and say hi!,positive
I love this place. Mike who runs the place is super cool and excellent with kids. Our coach for my son Greg and JJ are also pretty dope. They've taught my son a lot and we went from having 100% fear to having almost none at all. We do the skate lessons and will continue to do so. This place is awesome. Thanks guys a lot!,positive
"What a cool concept! Skateboard park INDOORS! Brilliant idea for arizona heat. Skateboarding is just so cool for kids of all ages and we can look for it with adults in the Olympics too. Mike has done a great job with this place. He teaches lessons and his son, Laser is pretty awesome on the skateboards himself. Mike has a passion for skateboarding and teaching kids how to board. He's cleaning up the sport one kid at a time. This undoor fun skate board park opened 2 months ago and you can buy memberships. Dont be scared if you're not great yet cause thats what the leasons are for. Also, they sell ramps and skateboards so you can find what you need here. Interior is way cool and your kids will fall in love and wont want to leave. Great way to keep them active, out of the son and having fun!",positive
"I love coming here! The drink's and food choices aren't much above your typical cafe, but what distinguishes itself is the atmosphere of a kwerky little cafe shop where you can crack out a chess board for a couple hours.",negative
Enjoyed an ice coffee and grilled cheese today. Nice homey old fashioned decor with a built in used bookstore. Service was awesome and super friendly.,positive
"I was walking along main street when I passed by this place. It caught my attention as it had shelves of books in the back, like a library. Only it's a cafe. Some of the books have price tags on them so I'm assuming you can buy the books. The drinks and food were reasonably priced. You have to add your own milk and sugar to your drink. The pastries/food didn't look that great, but maybe they taste better than they look. There's also a card you can get stamped so you get a free beverage for every 10 you buy. I ordered a coffee ($1.75 after taxes). There isn't much to say about it, it was a regular coffee. I enjoyed the atmosphere of the cafe. It's a nice place to sit and relax. Plus the seats were comfy! There were also a small assortment of boardgames that you can play.",negative
"Stumbled across this gem after eating dinner nearby. It has used books, ice cream, coffee, and pastries, and a lot of charm. I can't put my finger on it, but those aforementioned things, as well as old antique furniture and friendly staff made this place seem pretty magical to me. Take a look inside and grab a coffee while you're at it.",positive
"Love this cafe! Lots of character! Great cakes and tea! Every time we go there it's so peaceful there, and lots of books to pick.",positive
"If you wants to be feel nostalgic, you might like it here at Books Cafe & Things. You will find yourself surrounded by antiques, old books, CDs and old Country music while you surf on the internet. That might be your only connections here to the modern life. Sipping my tea while listening to folks talking about Hockey: contracts, lockout, fighting... A small stage in the middle of the cafe which Live music events are held on Saturdays and even has Psychic Reading sessions every Saturdays. If nostalgic is your thing or you want a change of scenery, Books Cafe & Things might be your kind of Cafe.",negative
"I really enjoy shopping at a Second Look. What great quality items! It feels like you are in a fine boutique, and they are making it better all the time! You can find such great quality items for a fraction of the price of retail. I am a shoe fanatic and have bought 1/2 my best shoes here as well as other fashion items. I also consign here and have always been treated very well and enjoy bringing items which sell pretty quickly because Second Look has a great customer base, and new people finding out about this hidden gem all the time. Highly recommend you check it out yourself!",positive
"I agree, a 2nd most unpleasant customer experience in a row deserves a review. I will not consign again until the tall, miserable guy is gone! I usually carry a balance but I cashed out my $350 because of HIM.",negative
"i have been a customer for a long time and the staff has always been friendly, knowledgable, and available when you need to find something. i trade in my clothes and the process is quick and easy. the two men (Josh and Dave) are always friendly and willing to help you. they work very hard and keep things organized. i think it's the best that i have seen in all the years that i have been there. i like that they have all sorts of other things to buy. it's not just clothes but a lot of household goods to update your decor. it's just a fun place to spend a few hours either buying or looking!",positive
"OMG....I don't know anything about consigning here, but shopping here gets a well deserved 5 stars. I spent over three hours there today! There are so many good deals and the store is extremely clean and organized. I purchased new Michael Kors sandals, five skirts for work and three dresses for about $50. Their awesomely fun system makes it a treasure hunt....a sliding discount scale for how long the item is on their floor. Everything I purchased was either 50 or 75% off. Definitely fun to shop here. The housewares are very nice too!",positive
Great for the buyers not so great for the seller. They store gets 65% the seller gets 35%. Don't take high end golf items here. The appraiser does not seem to know what a Taylor Made golf driver is worth . They sold mine for $12.50 I got 3% of that .,negative
"I brought in a Fontanini Nativity Village to sell which cost new over $1,000. I did not expect to get $1,000, I was hoping for $200 or less. When I went in to see what I had earned so I could buy more of THEIR stuff. I was amazed to learn that not only did it sell, but there were renewal membership fees, stocking fees and of course, they received very little for the set, so I received $0. What a rip off!!!! DO NOT EVER take your items to be sold there! Find another store if you want to get any money for them! And NEVER, EVER take a high priced item there to sell EVER!!!!",negative
"So here's an eye-opener. I dropped off some things for consignment recently, including a like-new Gucci belt I haven't worn in years because it's too small. Someone just called to say they won't accept it without a certificate of authenticity. Seriously? That's like requiring a certificate of authenticity at a garage sale. I told the caller I could attest to its authenticity because I bought it while working at Saks years ago, and to put it in their donation pile. Better yet, grab it for herself because a) its real, and b) it shouldn't go to waste. So that's a little window into the quality here - piles of low-end brands but an actual designer piece gets rejected for lack of 'proof'.",negative
"Convenient location off of 32nd Street and Shea. Large selection of many different themes of items. Layout is a little cluttered yet can be navigated easily. However, my reason for the 2-star rating is that even when I discover some decent merchandise, the staff is so unpleasant that I really don't feel like giving this business my money. There are other stores of a similar nature in the valley that will better appreciate my patronage.",negative
"Name a place where you can find buried treasure without having to dig? THIS PLACE! I love coming here not only for the amazing trinkets I find but also for their friendly staff. My mom, sister, and I have been coming here for over ten years when it was a little store. It's grown so much and although I am sad that they got rid of their little coffee shop, I still love them. This upscale consignment store will have everything you are looking for and more. I wish I lived closer to it because I would be shopping here probably three to four times a week. Wait, maybe it's a good thing! =P When you walk in you may not find a cart which kinda sucks but just bring one of those big reusable grocery bags and you'll be set. They offer major discounts on items that have been in their store for more than a month which is AWESOME. I once bought a Fitbit for $12.00. Yes, you read that right. 12 dollars. And it worked. I am truly happy for this great place. Thank you for existing!",positive
"Enormous selection of clothes, shoes, bags & household goods...at amazing prices. Everything beautifully sorted by color & type (skirts, tops, pants, etc.) so it is very easy to zero in on what you're looking for. Everything looks clean & gently worn, so there's no ""ick factor"", like in some consignment clothing stores. You cannot beat the pricing and their tags (the ""markdown dates"" are listed) eliminate the need to awkwardly ask ""when will this be reduced?"" Household items are in great shape, beautifully displayed and also sorted by color, type of item, etc. There's a big selection of new costume jewelry, makeup & gift items. I agree with other posters: some of the staff need counseling on how to interact with customers, while other employees are very nice. This is a bit of a drive for me, so I'm not often here....but love it when I do get a chance to stop by. It's always a fun & very rewarding experience!",positive
"BEWARE!! The online ""check your account balance"" does not work. No one answers the phone and I tried for 6 days! I was told I would receive a list of items I took in....never received. I took in a pair of $80 boat shoes (worn only the day I bought them) plus 4 other items and when I went in person to ask where my list of items was, I was told they don't do that. The shoes and one other item were sold....but I was told I owe them 73 cents!!!!!!!! RIPOFF.",negative
I absolutely love this store. I will not shop anywhere else. The store personnel is just so wonderful I cannot express in words. Genuine people who love to see you find your treasures. You just never know what you will find.,positive
"They ""donate"" almost everything you bring in.188 donations in one year! I have heard they have an underground shop in Prescott. I will never consign there again.",negative
"Everyone should check this place out - there is something here for all tastes. It is such an amazing store! I have bought several shirts and household items here for next to nothing! Even the stuff you think you're paying nothing for rings up at a discount sometimes. I haven't quite figured out the tags, but almost every time I check out I am pleasantly surprised by multiple unexpected discounts. The people I have dealt with have been super friendly too, I have read some of the other reviews and been doubtful. Maybe every time I have been there I got lucky? I found the people to be customer service bubbly and fun. I also thought the consignment side was very helpful and professional. I will be back many, many times as long as I live in Phoenix.",positive
"I love this place, I go there often. I do however agree with a previous review...some of the employees are a bit uppity, cold and unfriendly. So to the ladies that work there, please be helpful and friendly to ALL customers. I'll be there this weekend.",negative
For women's clothing and household it is the best I have ever shopped at. So much better than the competition in Scottsdale. This is an amazing store with great prices and fabulous merchandise. Those who give negative reviews are way off. I have brought people there from all over the country and they come back time and time again. They are very organized and quite selective with their merchandise. There is noplace better. I have found the staff extremely friendly and helpful every time I have gone. Never have I seen anything overpriced and again the merchandise is high quality.,positive
"Wow in reading some of these reviews, I honestly don't understand all the negativity unless they are from competitors trying to bring this place down a notch! I started shopping here about a year ago and the place is fabulous! I can't begin to tell you the wonderful finds I have made here. Besides the pricing, what I like is that this store is well organized and all of the items are new or like new. I've purchased things still in the original packaging. The used things are so gently used you sometimes wonder if they are brand new without the packaging. I've been to some other places where the quality is ""early attic"" and the prices are outrageous. This is the place to go for one-of-a-kind, well-priced household items. The shoes and the purses are not bad either! I haven't found a better place to shop than this.",positive
"There was a misleading sale tag stating something with $0.00 when I brought it to the attention of Duane she was very rude, told me that she have to figure out the pricing and didn't even say thank you for bringing it to her attention even though by law I should be able to pay what on the price tag which meant it was zero aka free. I didn't like the item and had no plan on buying it but so did want to bring it to their attention and do the right thing. Instead I was treated without any dignity or respect and like I did something wrong! Talk about getting treated like shit for doing the right thing! See photo.",negative
"I know there are some unhappy campers that have gone to A Second Look and didn't like the experience. But I have to say I found the way to do it... Go with a plan. Do I need a new Calvin Klein business suit for dirt cheap? Head straight to the back wall and check the sizes, try it on and get out. Do I need something black? Just head straight to the COLOR COORDINATED rack and sift through my size. Jeans? Same deal. Dresses? All on one long rack. This place is very organized and the dressing rooms are never too busy. It can be a great place to find quality clothing that isn't just Chicos for a great price. Just go with a plan next time....",positive
"Good selection but not worth putting up with the extremely rude employees and management. They have absolutely no patience for children. It's a consignment store, that you would think caters to people on a budget, young mothers, for example. Yet they are rude and intolerant of children. That makes no sense. I used to shop there very frequently, almost on a weekly basis but I won't go back anymore.",negative
"Have been shopping here for years, the store itself is not much to look at - but the prices are always good. They must cycle the inventory regularly - as I routinely find new things every visit. Staff seems friendly too...",positive
"As a shopper this is prob my favorite store of all times! (Not great as a consignor but really, when I buy something I'm not looking to get anything back when I'm done with it.) I have found some amazing business suits, evening gowns, casual attire, purses, and housewares here. I just love it! Well organized and clean store. Plenty of parking and I enjoy their pricing model.",positive
"Based on the postive reviews, I stopped in on a Sunday afternoon in search of a good deal. However, I was disappointed in the selection of clothes. While I appreciated the presentation, I was not impressed by the dated fashions offered for sale. I did find a few nice deals in the shoe department. I bought pristine Rockport sandals and a couple of pairs of Clark shoes. However, I was stung by the return policy. Upon closer inspection at home, I noticed one pair of the Clark shoes had a tear on the seams. However, because of their return policy, I was not able to return or exchange them. I took the shoes to a shoe repair shop in hopes of repairing them and was told they could not be fixed. :-( It would been nice to if they allowed exchanges for store credit. Oh well, it's a $15 reminder to really, really tug and check at all the seems of seemingly new shoes and clothes. :-) Overall, I would only recommend this place for shoes and other misc. bric a brac like collectibles. Their reductions policy is a boon for buyers in that the longer an item stays in inventory, the higher the discount.",negative
"I was quite disappointed today from a company I've been very happy about in the past. A pity really because I've recommended them to so many friends in the past. Well all good things come to an end and as with many the devil is in the return policy. The customer service rep helping me was defensive boarding rude when I attempted to return three shirts I had purchased yesterday. Apparently I misread the return policy and thought I had 24 hours but that was just for electronics. Though I was calm during the conversation even sharing an idea to take to management that might mitigate such situations in the future she continually assumed my statements and an aggression on my part that was not there. I repeated made statements such as ""I am not upset"" ""I've been on your side of the register"" We finally ended our interaction with her defensive recommendation that I consider reconsigning the shirts. Thinking perhaps this was a viable option I took the shirt that had been in my possession for less than 24 hours to the consignment area tags still on. There I spoke with another employee who seemed shocked when I shared that I shared that I had purchased the shirts less than 24 hours before and yet was unable to return them. She, like myself, was under the impression this was the policy. After learning that there were fees involved with reconsigning, and feeling the A Second Look had already taken my time and enough of my money I departed with the shirts still in had. It is obvious that the staff need training and the policies clarified. I guess I'll try the consignment shop on Tatum and Bell in the future.",negative
"i haven't been here in awhile but did find a pretty good selection when i did, what annoyed me the most and drove me out of the store b4 i was really finished looking was the DING, DING bell that went off EVERY time soneone came in or out. i know why they do it and it's not for the customer. until they stop (and Kohl's did awhile back), i'm not coming back!!!",negative
"Who doesn't love a bargain? I get an adrenaline rush every time I find a great piece at the fraction of the retail price. I don't even mind if it is used as long as it still looks new-ish. I thought A Second Look would be a great place to get that shopper's rush, but boy was I wrong. The place reminds me of my grandmother's closet because it has the hallmark finicky old woman organization. Everything is arranged according to color with signs everywhere proclaiming the consequences of touching and breaking. It is a little overwhelming. The clothes are not that great. Everything in the designer section looks like it came off the Beverly Hills 90210 set circa 1990, and it is marked up like crazy. The rest of the store follows suit; for example, I saw a faded shrunken American Apparel dress for $13.00 (I can't even begin to tell you what is wrong with that picture). While I commend the staff for meticulously keeping the store in perfect condition, I did not see anything that I would think of giving a second look.",negative
"Great place with great people. I shop here mostly for my work shirts, I have gotten some amazing dress shirts from $4 - $15 since I have been in AZ. I think my favorite thing about this place is they way they do their discounting. The longer the item has been in the store the more you save up to 75% off. Be sure to check the wall in the front of the store for the discount available based on the date on the price tag. Right now I am waiting a few more weeks in hopes that this one item I have my eye on hits the 60 day mark. This consignment store has a decent art section, plenty of household decorations and lots of cloths and none of it junk. I find the full non discounted price to be pretty reasonable most times (the item I want right now is overpriced). They go out of their way to be helpful and friendly and I appreciate that.",positive
"This place is better for shoppers than for consigners. On the positive side, I think it is organized well & doesn't feel cramped. From a consigners perspective, their policies have gotten ridiculous. They now charge you a $10.00 annual fee PLUS $3.50 EVERY time you drop items off. In addition to that craziness, they also want clothing brought in on hangers, pressed/completely wrinkle free. Quite frankly I don't have the time to go thru all of my items & either iron them or take them to the dry cleaners (which even if I go to the cheap cleaners for $2.00 & I end up with maybe $3-5 for the item when it sells, doesn't even make it worth the trouble). They also want to take a week or so to go thru your stuff & either donate what they won't take or call you & you have to make ANOTHER trip to go pick it up. Too much time/effort to make it effective for me. It also seems when my items sell, I get less for them than if I would have taken them elsewhere. As said in other people's reviews most of the items they have are very middle of the road (i.e., Express, GAP, etc), so it's not like they're only taking designer apparel to warrant such strict consignment policies. I will stick to taking stuff to My Sister's Closet which is easier to work with, they don't charge you fees, and tell you right then & there what they want to take. I feel I also get top dollar for my items at My Sister's Closet as opposed to here.",negative
"This review is for bringing your stuff in for consignment and based off one purchase. My family used to bring stuff here on a regular basis but not so much anymore, I need to get back into the habit. But when we did bring clothes, accessories, house goods, etc it was was really great, easy and very organized. I purchased my first real furniture sofa and love-seat set from here when I had my first real apartment after college. It was a great set and so affordably priced! I actually kinda miss that set, since then I have bought new stuff for my first real house. I remember the staff being very friendly and helpful. Especially when you aren't sure how consignment works, they walk you thru it with ease.",positive
"OK, full disclosure - I know the owners. Still, check out A Second Look and you'll see that they set the bar very high by consignment store standards. It's definitely not your typical second-hand store. For one thing, it's huge - as big as a department store, and the shopping experience is similar in terms of atmosphere and better in terms of selection given the range and uniqueness of the things you find there. The store only accepts ""as-new"" merchandise, so no worries about stains, holes or weird smells. The clothes are sorted not only by style and size but by color, which makes for a more efficient search for random treasures (I'm an attention-deficit shopper, especially when digging through racks of random clothes - so I like being able to save time by looking mainly in the colors that look best on me). You really never know what you're going to find, and their inventory turnover is high, which makes coming back regularly not only fun but practically mandatory. The discounting system is pretty innovative - almost all of the clothing has a dated price tag, and after 30 days on the rack, an item automatically goes 25% off; after 45 days, 50% off; after 60 days, 75% off, and after that it's taken out of inventory and donated to a charity that supports needy women and children. The housewares section is awesome, too - perfect place to find a bargain on the ice cream maker you keep thinking you want, or to change up the decor of your place for a fraction of retail. They have a big kids' section, and their holiday decoration stuff is definitely worth checking out once Christmas rolls around. Also, there's a coffee bar area tucked away in the back on the other side of the consignor drop-off area. It's a nice place to take a break from shopping, or to give bored companions a spot to hang out. Great coffee, too. Consigning the good stuff you just don't want any more is much better than just hauling it all to Goodwill - at least you stand the chance of making back a little money; worst case, if they don't sell, they'll end up going to charity anyway. Update 6/5/09 - No more kids' section here, nor hot coffee at the coffee bar, although cold drinks and snacks are still available. Still plenty of great bargains to be had!",positive
"Your items are too expensive for a thrift store. People stopped going to Dog Junkies Thrift Store because the prices all of a sudden tripled. Your prices are more than regular store prices. You started out as a good thrift store and people enjoyed going there to get the bargain, but now you're overcharging for items. You really need to lower your prices down to thrift store prices if you want to stay in business.",negative
I absolutely love that I found this thrift store. It's located on Rancho and has some high end shoes including Jordan's and Adidas that are barely used. There are signs out front for puppies but don't let that fool you. There is a lot of great stuff inside. Women's men's and kids stuff! I highly recommend checking is it out next weekend or just in your free time. Brandon Sevruk,positive
"I stumbled across this place while driving by. I don't get over here much, so I stopped. I was so glad I did. I am an animal lover so the fact that they support no kill animal rescues is uge for me. You can also volunteer and they give you a discount when you do. They have different daily sales. I can't remember them all off the top of my head, but Wednesdays is 50% off clothing. They have a Facebook page as well so you can check the sales for whatever day it is. It's clean and it's basically a house, so there are different rooms for you to explore. Plan to spend some time if you're stopping in.",positive
Really like this place. I especially like the fact the revenue goes to maintain their no kill dog rescue. They have the best selection of quality pet supplies that I have ever seen in a thrift store. Saturday is 25% for TEACHERS!,positive
They are so rude here. Saw a mirror they had just posted on offer up. Came in and they didn't have it and even worse they didn't bother to try and help me to see if they had it or anything. They were so rude about it. I really didn't want to give them any business after their attitudes. Made my day of wanting to go search through thrift shops for hidden gems no fun .,negative
"Only giving it one star because I can't go any lower. Answered an ad from them for a item they had for sale. The ad was ENTIRELY false. Item was listed as new and in box - probably wouldn't be as mad if when I got there the woman wouldn't have had such a funky attitude. When I answered the ad and i asked if the item was new and was told yes it was. Drive WAY ACROSS TOWN to find out not only was it not new but VERY used, filthy dirty and missing parts. When I questioned it the woman said I had to understand volunteers place those adds and they can't be responsible for mistakes - really? She didn't even have to decency to apologize for their mistake just told me it's still a deal - huh - a broken dirty machine is just as good as new? Didn't mind in the beginning because I was going to help a good cause but now I'm just super pissed that you wasted my time and gas and was treated badly by someone who was rude as hell - YES I'm talking to you lady with the short black hair",negative
"I head straight to the pet supply section first. They have a great selection of dog toys, clothes, leashes, harnesses...everything my babies need. Don't get me wrong. The rest of the store is great too. They also carry Pawsome Jerky. My dogs love it. I know you can order it online too, but this is the only store I've found it in so far. I highly recommend checking this place out. There's so much stuff to choose from and new stuff all the time. Plus (and this is the best part) every sale helps dogs in need. Total win win.",positive
I came in for a birthday present for my mom Olivia helped me out she was super awesome. Very attentive gave me really good ideas on what to get. I ended up buying a pair of super cute jeans and a super cute top to go with it! It's great service and great price that keeps me coming to a place and they have both!,positive
Olivia helped me pick out the cutest outfit ! She was a lot of help the clothes there are very cute I wanted to buy everything. Thanks again Olivia for helping me,positive
"The clothes fit well with beautiful styles. Customer service is exceptional & Jaquelin was extremely helpful in helping me choose an outfit for an upcoming special occasion. The store is always tidy and clean, pleasant to walk in to and shop. Totally recommend this store! One of my absolute favorites.",positive
"Okay so here's the problem with this store: the clothes are super cute and fairly affordable (albeit they run small) BUT the staff is pretty immature and bitchy. Granted, I've been here before and had zero issues with the employees...so they definitely do have some professional people working. But during my last visit, I asked the simple question of if I could use the dressing room only to overhear the male employee whisper something under his breath to the female employee the moment I turned my back! I'm not sure what was said but I know it was gossip about me because I turned around and they both looked away from me immediately and seemed embarrassed! Gossiping about a customer is a HUGE no-no and as someone who's worked retail I can tell you, they're lucky I didn't cause a scene because I felt pretty offended. To make matters worse, after emerging from the dressing room neither employee offered to help me or even attempt to save face with me! I definitely don't plan on shopping here again, which is a huge bummer to me because I like the clothing a lot. I just will not support a company that condones immature, catty, and unprofessional behavior.",negative
"Ramon C. is such an awesome sales associate. He is so funny, and provides the best customer service in the store. :) Love him! He helped me pick out the perfect dress.",positive
"review is actually for online purchases. I ordered from Aldo on 2/1 I received an order email stating that the delivery should happen no later than 2/12 and that there will another email with shipping details to follow, which I still have not received. Today I called Aldo because I've not received my order. The guy Jimmy on the customer service line said it was delivered on 2/8 and I said that I had not received the order. He said we'll have you looked around? Your house I said yes I have since I receive almost daily deliveries from Amazon with no issue. He said that they would open an investigation with UPS and that I should call back next Friday to see if they will be refunding my money. What happened to my order? And now you want me to call back and see if they will refund my money. Horrible customer service if you ask me. Such a shame.",negative
"The hours on Sundays for this location says from 11:00 AM to 8:00 PM. I had an event to go to that night so I rushed and got to the store at 7:00PM and they chose to close down the store early to do inventory/restock. That's something you're supposed to do AFTER closing hours, not shut the store down early for that. Really disappointed.",negative
"This specific Aldo shoe store has extremely bad customer service. I have worked in customer service for a while. I provide exceptional service, and therefore I expect it. The employees seemed like they had attitudes. Perhaps they do not like their jobs. I would suggest that Aldo corporate sends in some secret shoppers. It is unacceptable when shoppers have to wait and then go up to the employees to ask them to bring out shoes for them. I want to be greeted, smiled at, feel a positive vibe, and I want to be assisted. I like Aldo shoes. However, I decided to spend a lot less at this store than I would have if there had been better customer service. I'm sure there are better Aldo stores in Nevada to spend my time and money at. After leaving Aldo, I walked down to Steve Madden where the customer service and overall, vibe, was better. Something must change at this Aldo, or I will not return. The employees here must remember to be professional, kind, helpful, and upbeat. Instead, they seemed not to give a damn. They left me with the impression that they were rude and stuck up. So again, instead of spending $300+ on Aldo shoes, I walked over to Steve Madden.",negative
"I was on a hunt for heels with no luck. This was our last stop and I was getting a bit discouraged. I looked around and found nothing that I liked. All the heels were just waaaay to high for me to wear at work or were just boring. I eventually found my way to the clearance section where two pairs of flats caught my eye. My friend Loren found a pair she wanted to try on as well. The sales associate Jazlene was patient with us when we kept switching back and fourth with pairs. She also mentioned that they offer free shipping straight to my house if they didn't have a size in stock. I ended up purchasing the pair that Loren tried on for only $30. Just comfy black flats to run around in on crazy days at work. Although I didn't find what I originally came in for, I still had a good experience and walked out with something else. P.S. They also have really cute accessories like jewelry and purses.",positive
"I like the Aldo chain of shoe stores because it is a pretty nice mixture of decent fashion, decent quality leather shoes, at decent prices. For men, it's like Clarks or Bass with more style, or Kenneth Cole without the designer price. The two stars is for the staff/service. I didn't like the whiney voice of the person who helped us, she seemed off in her timing and attentiveness, should I say robotic sounding? Hey, I helped earn my way through college selling shoes, and later was a junior buyer at a regional department store chain early in my career, so I know a little something about shoes. The girl that helped us didn't. We didn't buy anything, but I professionally reboxed and stacked up the pairs of shoes for them to easily put away. That includes putting back all the tissue, cardboard, plastic, etc. that comes inside the box of every pair. The staff didn't seem to care less. Unprofessional. Just call me an old Shoe Dog. But a better breed than Al Bundy, the loser Horn Dog.",negative
"This place is very professional and convenient. I took several shirts and sports coats here for alterations. A few of my items, the staff recommended not to alter for one reason or another, which saved me money in the long run. This candor was greatly appreciated.",positive
"OMG! They really saved my butt today! Forgot my sport coat so bought one and needed sleeves hemmed, they truly did it while I waited saving me a huge embarrassment if I didn't have a jacket for next morning. Maybe a bit costly but staff was awesome, fun and friendly and did what I needed perfectly!! Gwen rocks!!",positive
Thank you! My husband needed a suit altered to be a groomsman in a wedding the next day and they were SO accommodating and kind!! They made the perfect storm of long travels and a way too big suit so much better! He looked quite handsome with the alterations competed and it was ready right when they had said. Thank you!!,positive
"DO NOT COME HERE I was WAY over charged for a crappy hem job. All they did was fold the fabric up and sew it. The worst part is, its a white dress so I can see the line right through the dress. And don't even get me started on the GREY STAIN that's now on my dress. Will never come here again, wouldn't recommend it to anyone.",negative
"Not sure I'm pleased about this...yet?!? Bought red dress @ American Commodore with my daughter for Homecoming. Dad took her for alterations with receipts & tags for Amer. Commodore. They said need coupon from A.C. To get discount...never was given coupon by A.C. or told needed one. Dad prepaid for alterations to get dress done in a timely manner. Would still like the discount ...come on, Alterations Express...you need to have a little business sense. Probably won't return for the next 5+ events unless you make it better for us !! Will be in to pick up next week...we shall see!! ??????",negative
Their customer service is horrible at this location. The young lady at the desk was unpleasant and seemed bothered. I can't rate their actual services because I turned right around after receiving a horrible first impression of the place by an employee named Sarah.,negative

"This was my first bridal appointment and the absolute worst. Despite making an appointment on a quiet Tuesday morning well in advance and filling out all their online forms as well as creating a wish list on their site of styles I liked, it was a disappointing experience throughout. First they had me refell out the entire information form when I arrived, then the consultant I was given proceeded to tell em none of the styles I showed her, pinned from their site, were not there. Despite describing in detail what I was looking for nothing I was given to try on was remotely in the realm of what I was looking for and I felt my concerns and requests regarding style were constantly being dismissed. It was clear my consultant was over it when she walked away saying she would write down the two dresses I didn't hate, but even then she couldn't tell me the designer of the dresses just gave me the sku numbers from their inventory which can't be looked up by anyone but them. Horrible experience and absolutely would not recommend to anyone, nothing like what you see on Say Yes to the Dress Canada.",negative
"My review for this store is actually 3.5/5. I came here last Thursday and said 'yes' to the dress! Before coming here, I had already gone to three other places. There was this very specific dress from Maggie Sottero that I wanted to try on so I called Amanda Lina Sposa in advance to make sure they had this dress before I booked the appointment. The store is really pretty and they have a lot of gowns for you to look at. I went with my mother and my fiancé's mom. We were free to look around while we waited for our consultant. After waiting for about 5 minutes, our consultant arrived. Our consultant was helpful and nice. The minute that I tried on the dress that I came here for, I already knew it was the one. So my appointment was really only 40 minutes. The only downside here is that you cannot take pictures, which I knew of already before coming in. After saying 'yes' to the dress, I was measured right away and the dress was ordered for me. Because I did my research on this specific dress, I knew that there was a petite size available (3 inches shorter than regular length) because I'm only 5'2"". However, I had to point this out to my consultant and the front desk. But they had already put in the order for the regular size so they had to cancel that order and then place another order for the petite before I paid my 60% deposit. Being only 5'2 and between a size 0-2, I think it would've made sense to at least advise your customer of the petite option so they can decide which one to get. But because I had done my research on this dress, I felt like I knew a bit more than my consultant? Other than that, the experience was good. You also don't need to alter your dress here if you don't want to. After getting my gown, I also visited the attached store which sells mother of the bride dresses. The ladies there were so lovely and sweet! Because I had purchased my wedding gown there, I get an additional 10% off for mother of the bride dresses. My mom and future mother in-law are interested in coming back for their dresses. At this time, I'm not sure if I will be purchasing my accessories at Amanda Lina Sposa. I just noticed in my follow-up email that ""any accessories purchased elsewhere including belts, jackets, etc., are not permitted during your fitting process"". Just a heads up for other brides who decide to come here. Overall, I would recommend this bridal store to other brides!",negative
"Ladies, let me tell you how Amanda-Lina saved me! I was going to Avenue 22 Bridal (on Dufferin and Eglington area) to get fitted for a bridesmaids dress. I gave it 2 chances (making time, driving across the city) where both times the associate was so snooty, impatient, rude, made unflattering comments about my body type that I absolutely REFUSED to make any purchase of contribute to their profits. After searching for a place that actually sold my dress and dealing with Amanda of Amanda-Lina's directly, she replied back to my voicemail almost immediately, walked me through the dress I needed to order, helped me order the dress and when it came time to picking it up, she (and her team) made things quick, easy, and efficient. If you want to be in good hands for your big day, you must come see Amanda. Don't even bother talking to Avenue 22.",positive
I absolutely loved my experience at Amanda Lina's! I had a problem with a wedding dress from another store one month before my wedding. I went here and within the first five minutes of walking into the store the consultant (Raina-love her) helped me find my dream wedding dress. She calmed me down and made me feel so relieved and excited after having a stressful time with my other dress. I am so excited and can't wait to wear my dress in 3 weeks!!!,positive
"I heard about this shop through a friend who went there, and she informed me that it was the ""say yes to the dress"" store. My fiance and mom were suggesting that I go there to see what the ""experience"" was like, since I was a fan of the show. After doing a lot of research (and reading only negative reviews) I decided not to go there. One day, My mom and I were in the area in between other bridal gown appointments and last minute decided to call up and see if anyone could see me. Within 10 minutes, I was in the shop with Teresa. I have to say my mind was changed about this place. The store is very pretty, sitting area for your ""entourage"" is comfortable and very luxurious. Teresa was nice and made great recommendations. Loved all her picks. She thought of a dress at the last minute which was nothing like what I described that I wanted, and it ended up being my favourite! She helped me in and out of every dress! Was not pushy at all. Downside is that you can't take pictures, this is a huge negative for me. Can't ""say yes"" without my maid of honour seeing it! (She lives a couple hours away so this is a big problem). Also I would just genuinely like to see how the dress photographs before I purchase it. The other huge negative is that they ripped all tags off the dresses so you can't see the designer of it! (Are they that insecure??) I managed to find the designer and dress online in a matter of minutes when I went home. Another downside is that you can't look around. All dresses are in the back and they pull things for you. Would be nice to at least see a few to determine what style you like. In conclusion, I had a better experience than anticipated, but you just have to weigh the pro's and con's about this place.",negative
"I was originally excited when i purchased an Amanda-Lina's Bridal Boutique dress on clearance since I got it for a fairly decent price and it looked like (after careful inspection) that everything was working and in good shape. A couple of months ago, I opened the dress bag to check on the dress and to my horror, when I touched some of the beading along the bust area of the dress, the beads just fell off! I was upset because it looked and felt fine at the bridal show! I did contact them to see if they could remedy this situation but they insisted I would have to pay them a fee for fixing a broken dress (a problem which arose because of their poor workmanship)! I know I took a risk when purchasing a 'final sale' dress but coming from Amanda-Lina's I thought I could trust the quality of their work. I guess not. So if you're a bride-to-be I'd say skip the headache and guesswork of which dresses are good quality or not and buy somewhere else. And if you've already purchased one, be VERY VERY thorough inspecting the dress. Good luck!",negative
"Worst Ann Taylor store I have seen. 3 people working. Only people in the store and not acknowledged. Worst service in any location I've seen. Dirty floors. Atrocious folding and sizing standards. Wife had a loyalty coupon they would not acknowledge because price was 50 cents off, although coupon didn't state any pretax minimum. A complete embarrassment to your company. Clearly leadership here is poor.",negative
"I tried to apply here before, a long time ago. I had an interview with the manager. The manager was so racist! Just cause i'm asian and she's white blonde lady. As i was about to walk out the store after the interview with her, she came running to stop me. I was like what's going on? She was like "" I have to check your bag"".. like wtf? Who does that? Its not even a five star store or any expensive store like branded store, like Louis Vuitton, Gucci or Valentino. Its just a regular Ann Taylor. I would understand her stopping me and checking my bag if i had an interview with an expensive store. But hell she's freakin racist and rude. Found a better job some place else. I don't think I want to work for her or at this place.",negative
I'd give this place 0 stars if I could. The manager is a racist and the overall service is terrible. Stay away from this store,negative
Worst customer service ever. I come here once a week hoping something will change. Nope. Today was the last time I'll ever come.,negative
I recently got a back injury and the sale associate didn't seem to mind shoving me to one side to help another customer with finding a size. I wanted to get to the other side so I said excuse me. The lady said as soon as she's done she'll move. The sale associate was the blond lady with long hair. I was sooo offended that I left. Please fire this filth right away!!!,negative
"I just got home from visiting this Ann Taylor location. I was happy to see the store in the Venetian close. They had horrible customer service there, and this place is even worse. I wasn't greeted entering the store. I had to find someone to let me into the dressing room. She just walked me into the dressing room and pointed to an open room. She didn't bother to mention her name if further assistance was needed. I had to buy three suits as I work in finance. I am happy to purchase them elsewhere. My money won't go to this store - ever.",negative
"Came in to look for some work wear, and found a couple of items. You need to come in with an open mind as it's usually hit or miss. There is an extensive sale/clearance section if you have some time to peruse. What this store is lacking is the customer service. When I walked in, there was no greeting - ok, fine because no one was near the front. As I walked around the store, I saw sales people but none of them said hello. When I went to check out the sales person asked for my email address and I asked for what - she said it was for the receipt so returns are easier. Then I asked if I will be put on a marketing list, and she said no. Well that's a lie. I have received email offers since. The last thing was that when I walked out of the store, I must not have noticed the store alarm beep, and none of the associates stopped me. I walked into a couple other nearby stores and I beeped upon entrance, and it was after the second store I knew it was my (first) purchase at Ann Taylor. I had to walk back and ask the sales person to deactivate the sensor. No apology for the inconvenience. Will I come back - not likely unless I'm bored and desperate. I'll go to another Ann Taylor or another store all together for my purchases.",negative
"Zero stars. Absolutely no help, no hello, nothing. I even had to find a dressing room by myself. Size 00 pants are too big for me anyway. But I definitely will not come back for anything else!",negative
Materials used to be of good quality now Ann Taylor use cheap materials and denim style is all curvy. I don't buy anymore but I'm a customer for 2 decades so disappointed with store.,negative
I have been shopping at this store for a few years now and I really like it. Its a huge store with some amazing stuff. On my most recent visit I came in looking for spring dresses. They have such cute dresses in for spring. I had my little one with me so I just picked a few things and bought them & would return any that didnt work out. Well I had 1 item to return so I came back a day later. The sales girl was very helpful and the return went smoothly. I hate it when they ask a bunch of questions. But she was not like that all. Very polite. I look forward to coming back in a couple weeks to see if any of the other dresses I liked go on sale. They have great sales all the time here. I picked up a few tops that were already marked 40%off and they were an additional 40% off. Love that!!,positive
"I love this outlet store!!! It's huge, featuring Ann Taylor Loft (the sportier, younger version of the popular Ann Taylor branding) there are lots of deals and steals, especially in the clearance section, back left of the store, and there are lots of friendly staff on the floor- they'll offer up bags and starting dressing rooms for you as well as tell you about the current promotions- extra percentage off the marked prices. I did not intend to purchase anything as I already picked up a few things yesterday morning, but when I saw the clearance section, I spotted so many cute dresses (I love dresses, in case you don't know me by now, or have not read my reviews in the past, I wear dresses to work during Spring and Summer; I'm a dress addict). Of course, I had to decide between two dresses, but one fit me like a glove, so I got the black and white one, which was marked $24.99. Even the lady helping me, told me that it looked really good on me and suggested pearls or the jewelry that was on sale, but I told her that I didn't need any more jewelry. On second thought, I might snag that other dress that I liked, sometime in the next couple weeks- it was super cute and hard to pass up at $19.99! The fitting rooms are to the back right of the store. My husband sat in the single chair, which he dubbed, ""oh that's where the husbands will sit, waiting for their wives."" It didn't take me long to show him my selections. I want gift cards to this store- that's how much I love it!!! The styles are very cute and on par with Banana Republic, and there are so many different colors, styles, and price ranges- all affordable work attire, which I adore. I like classic and somewhat trendy but not young-teenage-trendy, so somewhere in the middle. The sizing is a little bit bigger, for example, the dresses I tried on were X-Small and Small (I typically wear a size 8 dress in womens). I thought it was worth mentioning. The signs are visible and clearly indicate the extra savings (woo hoo!). The mannequins and displays are nicely spaced, as this is a large store, so it does not feel cramped at all. Good use of space, good amount of clothing on the floor. This store is located in the new part- the front of the outlet center facing Las Vegas Boulevard. Since we walked the bulk of the interior of the center, we went to one end, and then to the front of the center, and back to where we parked (the other side where we started).",positive
"I absolutely love Ann Taylor's clothing! The store is clean, spacious & surprisingly neat. There were a lot of great deals (up to 60% off) after Christmas! My only complaint, they need to get more people on the floor to assist customers.",positive

I actually love this Anthropologie and find the staff warm friendly and extremely helpful. I can't say enough good things about the entire shopping experience.,positive
"I've come to this store several times and the staff is horrible each and every time . Yesterday I walked in, a staff member looked at me, then rushed to the register area. Maybe I'll give my money to Free People!",negative
"I am a big clothes shopper and also hippie at heart. I have always loved the clothing at Anthropologie and the ones I've visited (mainly in the South) have given me great vibes. I love that we now have one in Pittsburgh and would highly recommend anyone who wants to be inspired by clothing/art/design to take a trip to Anthropologie. It is located in the new Bakery Square below the gym and is next door to a new Free People store, also a favorite. The prices are a bit expensive especially when it comes to shirts and accessories, however I think that SALE days are the way to go! Today (6/2/11) I went into the store and there was a great SALE selection and tops that were usually $50 were only $20 or $30. Makes a big difference if you buy several things, which I usually end up doing whether I mean to or not! The clothing is also worth the extra dough! Comfy! Soft! Lasts through washes! AWESOME! The staff in the store every time I've been in has been great and always helps you in the best way that they can and calls you by name once introduced. VERY GENUINE! 4 Stars, but only because when there isn't a sale you definitely have to watch your purchases and just be mindful (IF YOU ARE ON A BUDGET that is)",positive
"I don't agree with the previous review. When I shopped there during the Christmas rush, the employees I spoke with were friendly and helpful. Love the store chain itself and their merchandise. It is expensive though.",positive
"I use to love this store when they had the orginal owers but now since the new owners have taking over..... the Style, Uniqness, and Quality is not there!!!! Please go back to purchasing clothes like the orginal owners did.....i see why the other 2 stores have closed and it want suprise me if the one in Birkdale closes too. They need new Buyers....",negative
"Chic, chic, chic! I really like this place and any time I'm looking for a really fly top, Belle Ville is my first stop and they never disappoint. Eye popping gear for that special event without the worry of someone else showing up with a duplicate:-). The sales associates are fashionista's and very helpful. With so few shopping venues uptown, Belle Ville is a great find.",positive
"I stopped in the Belle Ville in Birkdale over the weekend and bought my girlfriend a few really nice shirts and jewelry. The pricing is affordable (especially in this market) but its cool stuff. (not your mom's chico clothing line! Ha!) Anyway I would def recommend it when you are in the Charlotte area. Friendly staff, very nice unique clothing items and reasonably priced. I think there are 3 of them in Charlotte area.",positive
"Took my wife here based on Allesandra's review (as well as lunch at meZ) -- thanks a lot. The clothes are very cute and more of the one of a kind types. My wife loved the selection and bought 3 dresses ranging from $40 to $60, several t shirts that were very colorful and unique, and some fun jewelry. The service was great. We will definitely be back!",positive
"Bold colors and one-of-a-kind tops that will make you stand out. Reasonable prices, and some funky jewelry. They've also got some classic pieces, like the awesome black Fall jacket that I fell in love with - definitely the kind of piece to add to your wardrobe that you will get lots of use out of, and under $100. The girls who work here are friendly, and they've got a decent size sale section in the back. I saw some great summer finds - go get 'em ladies!",positive
"Just bought a pair of shoes here and I can honestly say it was the best shoe buying experience I've had. I brought my old running shoes in and David, the owner, looked at the wear, asked me about what I did and didn't like about them, and then asked me to take off my shoes and walk around a bit so he could see my gait. Then we went to the treadmill where we could see my gait as I walked. He got a few shoes for me to try and eventually took me onto the treadmill to see how the shoes I'd selected affected my gait. He was also super helpful in helping me choose the right size of Superfeet orthotic for my foot. Overall, just what I was looking for. I feel like I got a mini session with a very friendly running coach.",positive
This store is staffed by incredible runners/walkers. While prices are high it's worth the quality. If the shoes don't work they have a great return policy. Local business owner. Great location and free parking is available.,positive
"I had my first ever experience at Berkeley today; I walked in and immediately was greeted warmly by the owner. He listened patiently to my running story and what I was looking for. He gave some great suggestions and got me going with Mike, who was equally as awesome. Never once did I feel rushed--I felt important as a customer and very welcomed. I will be back!",positive
"I really like this place. The staff has always been helpful and polite, without pressuring me to buy stuff. They're definitely willing to take the time to get you the right shoes for your feet. They probably have the best selection of random running gear of any running store in Madison, which is very nice. Even though the store can seem a bit crowded, that's MUCH better than some other stores which are open and airy and never have what I need. Their prices seem in line with what you'll pay anywhere else for decent running gear, at least the brick and mortar stores in town. Since I live east of town, I don't know what their training programs are like, but it's nice that they have some. Since Madison lacks a significant, independent running club, it's up to the local shoe stores to fill in the gap.",positive
"While I was shopping here, I mentioned to the owner that this place is very impressive. He quickly said ""hopefully not too impressive?! I don't want to frighten people the way some athletic stores do with too much gear."" See, this would have been my impression of the place had it not been for the incredibly friendly demeanor of the owner and the staff as a whole. The level of service at this place is top-notch, the sort of service and expertise you secretly hope for (and pay for) at small boutiques. As soon as I walked in, I was greeted and brought to an associate who got to work getting to know my feet. They asked me what I was looking for and what my activity level was, watched me walk around, correctly pointed out some orthopedic abnormalities that needed correcting, and set about looking for precisely the right sort of shoe for my lifestyle and physiology. We then tried on at least eight pairs of shoes, covering a wide gamut of options in terms of shapes, fits, and designs. All during this, he answered questions I had about running shoes, their mechanics, their care, and other sundry things that I've always wanted answered but never knew anyone knowledgeable enough to answer them. The last time I had that sort of attention, I was at Saks being fitted for a suit. In short, the service here is impeccable. And if you want anything better than the cheapest disposable sneakers from Zappo's, then come here and buy the right pair. PS: I checked in on Yelp and they gave me a coupon for $10 off! So don't forget to do that.",positive
"Wide selection of shoes and running gear and all of the staff are super educated about their products. For a noob like me, the staff have offered good options on shoes while not being pushy. One of the employees, Steve, has helped me check out twice and has been very helpful in particular.",positive
"Huge selection in stock, very friendly and knowledgeable staff. They also have student discounts! I wear a weird size (w 10.5) and I was amazed by the options I had. And the shoes I bought are perfect!!",positive
"My husband and I traveled an hour to Madison to come to this store. We walked in and were greeted right away. +5 stars. I started talking to the man about my running habits and he just looked at me and with a look in his face like, ""why is this woman telling me about her running habits?"" He was so uninterested in what I was looking for or my concerns with my running. I asked to run on the treadmill and expected him to assess my running...you know...because we are in a SPECIALTY RUNNING STORE. I got on the treadmill twice and not once did he ask me how the shoes felt, looked at me, or anything. He made me feel like I was a burden and that my business was not wanted. -4 stars (it would be -5 if that were possible on Yelp) So, I said f*** it and bought them somewhere else.",negative
"I went in to pick out a new pair of running shoes even though I couldn't buy them for a few more weeks. The employee helped me determine what types of shoes would be best and even helped me find quality shoes for a low price. He made sure the fit was correct and that I would be comfortable running, which was a concern returning from an ankle stress fracture. Updated: went back in to actually buy the shoes I picked out and everyone was so helpful again! They made sure I got the right size and fit since I was in between sizes and assured me that if I tried them out and don't like them right away I can bring them back!",positive
"This is my first store to get fitted properly for a pair of running shoes. My first visit was a year ago, where I was promptly greeted by the owner, David, immediately upon walking in. As he led me to the back of the store where the running shoes are he asked about my running routines and style etc, making me very relaxed the entire time. David measured my feet, analyzed my walking style and started bringing out pairs of shoes for me to try. He even went to the sales rack to see if there were any that fits my running style to help save some money on them. David and his team are really patient with me. They never insist on a particular pair just because they think it is good. They go out of their way to pair you up with shoes which you find comfortable. It was training with that pair of shoes which saw me complete my first 10 k run. Recently I went back again to look for another pair of running shoes. Unfortunately I picked a wrong time as a series I was hoping to try on were out of stock because a new model will be launched the next month. But David and his team are as nice as always, never pushing me to buy a different product, and even thanked me for stopping by. David and his team knows a lot about running and are always enthusiastic to share their experience and tips with you. They are also concerned about their customers: there was someone with a blister on her foot. David saw it as he was measuring her feet. He asked her how she got it and offered tips to avoid it in the future. Berkeley has running clubs for people of all standards and various discounts for students etc. Just check with their friendly team of professionals who clearly love what they do.",positive
Love this place! The level of customer service provided by David and his staff is unparalleled by any store that I have shopped in for as long as I can remember. I brought my daughter in for her cross country running shoes for the second year in a row and was treated so well I would never consider going anywhere else. (David actually greeted us at the door and remembered that we had been there before...wow!) They made sure she had the right shoes for her feet and she couldn't be happier with them. They have tons of other cool products for runners too! Can't say enough great stuff about them...the best!,positive
I'm brand new to running and was very intimidated by going into a running shop. The owner immediately made me feel welcome and comfortable. The gentleman that fitted me for shoes was patient and very informative. I just completed my first run in the shoes that I bought and am very pleased!,positive
"This store is AWESOME! I had a terrible experience at another specialty running store, so when I walked in here I was pretty frustrated and apprehensive, but I couldn't be happier with the level of service I received. They took the time to ask me all kinds of questions about my running style, watched me walk, then had me try several different shoes on the treadmill with the video monitor to show how my feet move. I found a fantastic pair of shoes at a really good price. I will definitely be going back here for all of my running shoes, and will highly recommend them to everyone.",positive
"Pretty great! Got a lot of food for a little $$$. Funniest thing? Being here from So Cal, I'm trained to not use plastic bags. In fact now they are banned. If you need a bag you buy it. That one is heavy duty and recyclable without special trips to a grocery store bag drop. Well I told the cashier not to bag. I'd put them in my cart and bag them as I load them into my car. She said...that's weird...I feel like I'm not doing my job! I lmao!",positive
So I bought two piece sofa and love seat really loved by t after 2 months the sofa is coming a part I called 3 times before someone replace it. Now two months later not only is it breaking in the back but when I sit you fall straight to the ground. Spend like 750 with delivery I called twice already and they said a manager would call me and it's been 4 days no call. My next step is to write a letter and I explain my situation. Signed completely disappointed,negative
"Just bought a sectional at Big Lots. We are on a budget and we were excited to get our new sectional for a reasonable price. I would have given Big Lots more stars, however their delivery service is way too expensive. We live 15 miles from the store and we were told that their base price to deliver was $55. When the delivery service called us, it was $75.00. NOT good. Most people that shop at Big Lots- we are there to save money, not get gouged on delivery. I tried to negotiate with the delivery service and the person I talked to was not nice. Won't be buying anymore furniture at big lots",negative
I dont get the negative reviews! This place is great! Everyone is extremely friendly - as they walk by they ask if they can help you and introduce themselves and let you know if you need anything to just ask. I've made small talk with a few of the employees there and I thought they were great! Store is clean and has a great selection.,positive
"I'm embarrassed to admit that I bought something from here. The prices are higher than Walmart and the floor employees are twice as rude. Went in to buy a dog bed with my 79 year old mother and encountered the worst cashier ever. (Very large African American woman with acne and a tight fitting shirt that didn't quite cover everything -- why she wasn't sent home to change into something that didn't violate nudity laws is beyond me.) The item had no price tag so we asked for a price check. She disappeared for 7 or 8 minutes and left us waiting in line (causing the line behind us to grow longer). She came back with a totally DIFFERENT item and wanted to use that for the price. When my mother told her it wasn't the same, the cashier said, ""It's the same size"" -- which it wasn't OBVIOUSLY. She argued with my mother for 5 minutes and tried to hoodwink her on the price, being overtly dishonest -- apparently she thought since my mom was a senior, she could be cheated and lied to without consequence. I had had enough at that point. When I asked for the manager, the cashier threw a fit, grabbed the store phone and yelled for the manager. The manager showed up, apologized, and got the price right. All the while, the cashier in the back was still smirking and very obnoxious. She should be fired or at least put in a position where her exposure to customers is limited (like stocking shelves after hours.)",negative
Absolutely the most rude manager. I returned a floor power cleaner because when I opened the box the nozzle was full of hair & dirty. The manager said well this has been used. If she would have looked at it she would have realized it came that way. She was very rude to me and finally returned my money. I will NEVER shop there again !,negative
"Beware! I called the store before I drove down to double check the prices on student notebooks. The clerk who answered assured me that I can still get notebooks for .17 cents each. I was even assured there's no purchase limit (teacher). So I drove down and the prices changed to .90 cents each. I asked why and if they would honor the lower price since I just called AND spoke to someone less than 15 minutes ago. ...the clerk just shrugged her shoulders and said, no. Be Careful! I used to love this store and shop here but now they have lost a loyal customer!!!!",negative
"I've shopped here off and on over the years. I was shocked when I went in this morning to find that the prices went up - and not by a little. Some of the toys I saw there cost more at abig Lots as the same toys at Target or Walmart. Ive never seen that before at this store. The store is stocked full and is so disorganized. If I am going to spend that amount, I might as well go to Walmart or Target and have an easier return policy should anything need to be returned. Sure, there are little things there that you can't fid anywhere else, and that is the bonus. But the downside, the lines. One cashier per shift. Now that the snowbirds are back, it's not worth it.",negative
"The guy who helped me really explained everything to me: cushioning, support, weight. I tried on about 6 pairs of shoes, ran a bit in them in the store, and went with something with a bit less cushioning and weight than my old mizunos. I felt like he really took the time to make sure I found the right pair of shoes for me. I just got home, can't wait to run in these new babies!",positive
"A force de courir je me devais de changer mes chaussures. Après m'être renseigné j'ai entendu parler de cette boutique. Leur site est complet et permet de se faire une idée sur le business et les chaussures vendues. On parle ici avec des spécialistes, des personnes qui courent, utilisent les produits et les connaissent bien. Il y a un peu d'espace à l'intérieur qui permet d'essayer les chaussures avec quelques foulées et donc de se faire une idée un peu plus précise que de l'essayage statique. Pour ma part j'avais plusieurs modèles en tête que je voulais essayer et la vendeuse m'a sortis une paire que je n'avais pas envisagé. Au final elle est devenue ma paire et par rapport à ma façon de courir c'était clairement un meilleur choix vis à vis des autres. Je ne peux que féliciter les conseils de la vendeuse qui m'a vraiment aiguillé sur les bonnes chaussures. Elle m'avait conseillé de prendre une grandeur de plus, je n'avais pas écouté son conseil et finalement elle a eu raison (tête de mule inside). J'ai donc après ma première course repris contact avec eux pour demander un échange et il a été accepté pour une pointure plus grande. On m'a mis la paire de coté et je suis allé la chercher rapidement :) Il y a aussi pleins de vêtements de course et même une personne pouvant vous donner des conseils sur la course (Kinésiologue et entraîneur de la clinique). Un magasin donc très complet sur l'environnement de la course à conseiller quelque soit votre niveau de pratique sportive :)",positive
"Whether you are a veteran marathoner or a brand new runner you should come here for all your running needs. The store is located right on Saint Denis and isn't far from Beaubien metro. If you drive they have a small parking lot for clients which is appreciated since the parking is metered in this area. They have an excellent selection of shoes for all types of running gaits and they carry a lot of Asics shoes which scores big points with me since I swear by this brand for my running shoes. The staff are very knowledgeable and if you don't know what kind of shoe type you need they will be able to help you with that. In addition to that they carry tons of running clothes for all seasons and accessories like fuel belts, hats and so on. The store is pricey but then again I have yet to find an affordable running store in Montreal. Sometimes if you are lucky you will find stuff on sale but if you don't be prepared to shell out the money for whatever it is you want to buy. They also offer running clinics to prepare you for races so if you are toying with the idea of running a race and would like to train in a group with some coaching look into this. These clinics work up to a specific goal race. They can be a great way to get into running or to take it up to the next level.",positive
Came here to pick up my race kit last weekend. The place looked nice and friendly. They didn't have the gels (to eat) that I usually eat but they didn't push any others because they know people are particular about their gels haha. I'm going to go back since I have a $25 gift card and will update on the service,positive
"Magasin spécialisé dans la course à pied, tant pour la vente d'articles que pour les cliniques de course. je m'y suis rendue pour le grand choix de chaussures de course mais également pour avoir de bons conseils. Le vendeur a bien analysé mon patron de course pour me conseiller la meilleure chaussure. Je le conseille à tous les coureurs quelque soit votre niveau. Pour les gens du coin qui se cherchent un groupe de course allez-y, c'est toujours plus motivant de courir en groupe.",positive
"Buyer beware. They don't do returns, only store credit. for a $70 bra. think before you shop here. super uncomfortable. they did ""a fitting"", and in the store it seemed really snug, but they assured me that's normal... It's a new bra, and THIS is the proper fitting, they said. I couldn't wear it longer than 20 min. Too uncomfortable. Went to return it and they informed me they don't DO returns. Huge sign, I didn't see, my bad. Just want to help other ladies. Don't shop here.",negative
Where do I begin? I had my first bra fitting today and it was amazing!! I have finally found the perfect fitting bra!! For years I have wasted so much money on bras that never quite lived up to my expectations. I have two drawers full of bras that I never wear but one 'go to' bra that is the most worn. The ladies that work here know their stuff! I feel like my posture is better and I look SO much better in all my clothes!! Never again will I order from adore me or some website like that. You ladies rock!!,positive
"This is the go-to place. Mr. Bra knows his inventory and how to get you the perfect fit. He is no nonsense. Although he is ""in your space"", it is all professional and handled quickly. A little on the pricey side, but well worth it. Having been ""blessed"" since I was 13, I have never in 40 years had a better fitting bra. I won't be buying my bras anywhere else. I stopped in to pick up a strapless for my daughter's wedding. I have never had a strapless bra that fit so well. The girls stayed in place and I didn't feel like they were going to fall out, or that the long line was going to roll up on me.",positive
"I've been wearing ill-fitting bras for years, and now I will only shop here. Don't let the location and look of the store deter you if you need a good bra. After finding them on Yelp and reading such great reviews, I've been wanting to come here for probably a year. My shopping experience was SO EASY, the expertise and professionalism was remarkable. I allowed myself an hour and was done in 10 minutes. I will be back and send friends!",positive
Great place. I wear a hard size to find bra and have a lot of skin allergies which makes it almost impossible to find a bra to meet my needs. The staff was very helpful and found me a great bra. Parking is not the best and not in a great location. But you can't beat the selection and price.,positive
"After hours of wasted time at VS, Macy's, and Target, we came across CC's online. Despite some of the reviews, we headed straight there. 30 minutes later left with 4 fantastic bras. The service, knowledge, and professionalism was on point. No BS here. They have been fitting larger busted women for decades and it shows. A customer for life! Thanks C C's!",positive
"I am seriously so glad I stumbled across this gem on Yelp! I always knew I was bigger than DDD but wore that size for years anyways because I didn't want to spend $60 for a bra off line that wouldn't properly fit me either. But I didn't realize that my actual size is 40M. I was properly fitted yesterday at CC's and it actually took me longer to find the place than it did for me to walk out with a new bra for a very reasonable price! I'd say if you're going off of GPS, make sure it takes you to near Thomas Rd and 32nd Street because when I clicked on the address on yelp, my GPS opened up on my iphone but it took me to a neighborhood around 50th Street and Camelback.... so I wasted about 30 minutes of my time because of that but that's probably a glitch on my iphone Maps. Anyways, I will never buy from anywhere else as long as CC's is here and I would recommend it to anyone who needs lingerie.",positive
"I'd been putting it off for months. I needed a new bra, a bra that fit properly. My friend had told me about CC's, insisting that I go there and so finally, on Saturday afternoon, I told my husband ""I'm going to the bra store."" I was going to a party that night and I did not want to be squirming and adjusting all evening. When I arrived the young lady was checking out another client so I wandered around the store, checking out the fancy lingerie. The transaction was taking a bit and the store is quite small so I was trying to not be too awkward. Finally it was my turn. The young lady asked me a few questions, took some measurements and returned with a nude colored specimen. She helped me get strapped in, made some adjustments and showed me how to bend over and wiggle those girls in. Boom. Done. New bra that fits great and also has me feeling a bit perkier. My entire transaction was so quick and painless, I couldn't believe I'd put it off for so long! I got home with my purchases and my husband said ""I thought you were going to the store"". He too was surprised such a transaction could be done so quickly (however, he knows this will never be true when it comes to buying shoes.)",positive
"I discovered CC's yesterday when I had a bit of a bridal bra emergency. It was the day before my wedding dress fitting and after failed attempts of ordering bras online and having them show up only to not fit right, I was in a bind. I didn't think there was a chance I would find somewhere locally that carried my size...but thank goodness I was wrong! Someone suggested CC's to me, so I went in and the girl was so helpful. I showed her a photo of my dress, which has a very unique cut in both the front and back (so on top of wearing a hard-to-find size, I was faced with the task of finding something that would work with this dress). She measured me, put me in a bra, showed me some tricks to make it work with the cut of my dress and sent me on my way. Bra shopping is usually a painful task, but I was in and out of there in 10 minutes with exactly what I needed. Added bonus, the bra/corset that she sold me is lacy, gorgeous and super slimming...I feel beautiful in it! Way better than any of the others that I had tried on previously. So grateful I found this place!",positive
Been going to get my bra's here for years. Cant say enough.... I have plus size twin ladies and always had bruises and shoulder/back pain until I began to buy my bras here. Beatrice is the best and the bras last a very long time (as long as you take care of them). Going back tomorrow for a few more!,positive
Highly recommended for fitting that really works! They say don't worry about numbers and letters; just let us fit you. Service by young lady excellent-also many garments for wearing w special gowns.,positive
"My partner and I had a wonderful experience here! I'm from LA and was visiting some friends in Arizona. This store is much better with more selection than many of the plus size stores in LA and the owner definitely knew his business. I needed some lingerie and had a rough idea of what I wanted and the owner not only measured me for an accurate fit but the first garment he suggested fit like a dream. It supports ""the girls"" but also made me feel very sexy. He also made sure that I had the perfect size thigh highs to go with corset. Thank goodness I can also order online and will be doing so the next time I need more lingerie or a new bra. So glad I found this place!!",positive
"CC's will get you the right bra, couldn't be better. The fitting is pretty quick, he'll measure the underbust, bust, and overbust. After that, whatever bra is suggested you'll put your boobs in the cups and arms through the straps then let the fitter know you're ready for him to adjust the straps and fasten it. Trust their judgement! I'd never worn an unlined bra before, but thanks to their suggestion I have seen the light! Including some chit chat at the counter, I was in and out in under 20 minutes. The service is great, no messing around, they just get it done!",positive
"The girls are so happy right now. The other reviews are spot on - Expert service and advice, a huge selection. The store is not fancy, but for those of us who are never going to find a bra that fits shopping at Victoria's Secret, this place is bliss. I will definitely be back.",positive
"This is the place - if you can't buy at V.S.; if you're tired of clueless ""fitters"" telling you a 34F is the same as a 36D; if you know cups come in J sizes, if your back hurts, you are a AAA, or you have a specific need like bridal, mastectomy, etc.. You know who you are. This is not the place to 'browse', everything is sorted by size and they grab it for you. This is a function shop. Function can be pretty too, but this is function, first and foremost. So the neighborhood is not Scottsdale, big deal. It's easy to find. Parking out front. If your girls need some bra loving get in the car and drive here. Beatrice measured me in 2 seconds, and I knew she was right with the size because I've been hard to fit my entire life. I told her what I needed/wanted- I had 3 items in mind. She brought me one item for each need. They all fit perfectly. I didnt' ask to see other options. My goal was achieved. I was in and out of there in 10 minutes, there was a bride next in line for her needs. Prices were more reasonable than I expected. I'm used to paying about $80 - $90 for each bra. I walked out with 3 for less than $200.",positive
"Love this place! Go in, get measured, she brings you the perfect bra! The girls are lifted and separated.... Need I say more?!!!!",positive
"I was in and out in under 15 minutes. She had me sized up in 15 minutes and in a bra in less than 20. For a girl who is an ""H"" this is an amazing thing...I didn't even shed a tear. I bought three great bras for $218, That is nothing when I've spent an average of $90 per bra. I will be back and this will be the only place I will go.",positive
"All right ladies, you seriously have to try this place for your next bra...! I am a generously endowed woman and have always had trouble finding bras that would fit me. On a whim this morning I went to CC Lingerie where I handed ""my girls"" over to Beatriz. She asked me about my style, then took a quick measurement and told me ""You are a perfect 38 G."" She came back with.... THE PERFECT FIT! I even looked thinner with a great fitting bra. I took one in black and one in nude and I was out the door in less than 15 mins . The 2 bras I bought were 49.99 each, totally in line with department store prices, plus personal service. I will never buy another bra anywhere else!",positive
"Ok. Seriously! The most PAINLESS bra shopping experience EVER!! Beatrice is a doll, and makes you feel completely at ease the moment you walk in. I'm back in my car to leave in less than 15 minutes with 4 new perfectly fitting bras (2 bras, each in nude & black). She never made me feel rushed or pressured, just listened to what I need and brought it over to try on. The new bra felt so great, she just cut the tags off and I dropped my old tattered bra in their GARBAGE! (The only other use I could think of would be as a dog pull toy, but that seemed like recycling gone too far, even for me!) I feel like a new woman going off to new adventures with happy girls leading the way!!",positive
"I am in shock. I just walked in, talked to a lady, she brought me a bra, it fit, I paid for it and left in five minutes. I have NEVER had a bra buying experience that wasn't a marathon of searching through racks to find my size. I usually buy my bras online, but I am pregnant and knew that I needed a fitting to see what size I am now, so I decided to make the 40 minute drive to this store. So worth the drive! It is in a sketchy area, and there are a lot of signs and visual clutter when you walk in, so you might miss the signs saying that there is a $25 fitting fee (I didn't see them, but my mom did.) If you know for sure what size you are because you've been professionally fitted, then I'm not sure how the experience would be. Another reviewer mentioned that they service the drag community, and that does seem to be the case, as I saw a gentleman in drag walk in during my short visit. But I'm not sure why that would matter in your own shopping experience. Parking does suck, but there were spaces when we went on a Saturday afternoon. It was a great experience with a staff who knows their bras & boobs! Go. You won't regret it.",positive
"Finally made it C C's after getting a recommendation from a co-worker. Based on a couple of reviews, I expected to see a store located on a street/block with derelicts and criminals hanging around. None of that was true. Although the shop is located in an older area of Phoenix, there is nothing seedy about it. Having been born and raised in L.A. I KNOW what seedy looks like and that wasn't it. I wasn't worried about my car being parked there and I drive a convertible. My mother and I went in and walked up to the counter. Art was in the back near the dressing rooms and waved us back. While very ""matter of fact"" I still found him to be warm, friendly and humorous. He offered my mother a chair and directed me to the dressing room. He asked me several questions about what type of bra I was looking for, measured me (42H) and then shooed me into the dressing room, closed the curtain and directed me to remove my top and bra. In less than 60 seconds he was back with a bra for me to try on. Told me to put it on and he would hook it in the back for me. I came out and modeled the bra and the fit appeared to be perfect. He had me put my top on over it and I confirmed that my ""girls"" looked good in the bra AND it was comfortable. He asked me if I wanted to wear it and after telling him yes, he removed the tags. I then told him that I would take two more. The entire fitting probably took no more than ten minutes. At no time did I feel nervous or disturbed over the fact that he was a man. (Besides, how many of us go to male gynecologists?) This man definitely knows his craft, and that is fitting bras. It is definitely not the ""chi chi poo poo"" type of lingerie shop where you go to browse, but I'm pretty sure that if you know what you want, they probably have it. I will definitely make the trek to CC's (from Surprise to Phoenix) for all of my bra needs.",positive
"I read the reviews on numerous sites and didn't know if I should try it. The last time I was fitted was 6 years ago when I was pregnant. I am writing this to give you all an honest opinion. I am a very LARGE size (I) and had been craming into smaller bras. I've gained weight because I quit smoking so I needed to finally break down and buy some new bras. I already made my mind up that if I felt uncomfortable or the owner was in a bad mood (I had read this) I would leave. I went into the store and walked out 10-15 minutes later, fitted and with 2 new bras. Like I said, I'm a very large cup size (I) and I purchased a sports bra and regular bra. For 2 bras I spent just under $140 but it is worth it to me. I can't walk into any store and just buy a bra because they don't fit. Read the reviews like I did, but go give it a shot. I'm glad I went!",positive
"Since most of these reviews are incredibly old, I decided to bite the bullet and go on a friend's advice to CC's. I went on a Saturday and there was a woman working. She quickly measured me and asked me a handful of questions about the bra I was at the shop for. She helped get me into a bra and was very professional about making sure everything fit in right. She was good about answering any questions I had as well. In addition to a strapless bra, I bought a sports bra. While I paid a lot for them, they seem good quality. I was in and out of the store in about 15 minutes. That included a measurement, fitting on both bras to ensure they were comfortable and fit well. I wasn't pressured into more bras or accessories that I didn't need. The lady that helped me was professional and courteous (and super helpful with all my questions). I didn't feel rushed out of the store, either. They're just fast and good. I highly recommend this shop if you have an odd size or if you're a larger lady. I believe they have more normal sizes too, so stop by if you need a good bra. The location seems odd and slightly sketchy, but the shop was clean and they had a good stock of products. The lady who was working was really quick about finding bras, too, so they keep things organized well. If you do go to their website mrbra.com, it looks incredibly old, but most of what they had there is on the site as well if you like to order online.",positive
"Holy cr*p. I am still recovering from the experience. I wish I had read these reviews first. I was NOT prepared for CC. Pushy, creepy, condescending...violating. How about asking before pulling up my shirt and undoing my bra?! No kidding, I felt like I avoided a molestation. I suppose I should put my big girl panties on and just bask in the service he's delivered ""since 1969"" but no, thank you. Be very careful, girls, when you approach. I recommend bringing a bodyguard.",negative
"Have no fear! I took my mother to CC's today to find a mastectomy form bra. Admittedly, when we drove up we were hesitant to go inside. (From the outside it looks a little seedy.) I actually quickly looked it up on Yelp and we decided to give it a try. The young lady who was there to help us was wonderful and kind. She assured my mom and helped her to find a great bra at a reasonable price.",positive
"The first time I walked into CC's was over twenty years ago and the original owner took one look at me and told me I was in the wrong bra and the announced what my real size was without evening measuring me; and he was correct. His son now runs the business and he provides an experience; you will not find fancy racks and displays of lingerie everywhere like you would in a typical retail store, but you will find a bra that fits. Both the owner and his help have an interesting approach to customer service, but I enjoyed the direct, no BS service. In a world of phony customer service from people who just collect a paycheck, I found CC's to be quite refreshing. If you need a good bra that fits, support a local business and visit CC's.",positive
Since getting pregnant my chest size grew from a 34DD to a 34G. At first I was so happy to find a place I could actually try bras on instead of internet shopping. I was very uncomfortable with the owner from the beginning. As many women have mentioned he is creepy and arrogant. He walked in on me in the dressing room while trying on my last bra. The three times I visited the shop I dreaded the experience but felt that was my only option for finding this hard to fit bra size. After my last visit I went on a search for another place that sells my size and found Nordstrom in Scottsdale's Fashion Square they were not only less expensive but a pleasant and comfortable experience.,negative
"Had problems with the bras that I bought (2 for 180 dollars). Went back one week later the owner was red-faced and angry, my friend wanted to call the police because he took his hands and fingers and put them down my not-low-cut top and told me that I was wearing my bra for ""play"" and it wasn't meant for ""play"". He yelled at me, got in my face and told me that I wanted my bra low-cut and that's what I get... I meant to write this re-review earlier but just don't even want to think about the entire situation. Honestly, I am a survivor, I don't need that shit.",negative
"Read great things about this place, and stopped by to take a look. I've driven past this place a million times and kept going. I've stood outside this place at least a few times, hands clenched, determined to go in. I've been to some seedy places before, but this place always freaked me out. It has to be better on the inside, right? Nope. There is no stock on the floor to shop, so you better commit when you walk through the door. The man working there (presumably the owner?) may in fact be very skilled, but he was also pushy, abrupt and even a little bit condescending. The service and product at CC's may be the best the valley has to offer, but I can't get past all the jarring elements of my experience. :( It is not worth it for me.",negative
"Warning guys - this is girl talk. If you have one of those dresses and/or outfits that is almost impossible to wear a bra with, you have an impossible to find size, you feel you're starting to lose the fight against gravity, or if you'd like it to look like, well... like your pillows are extra fluffed - this is an awesome spot for you. This isn't Victoria's Secret by any leaps and bounds. There will be no lotions or silk pillows. It's all about lift and separate. Well, they have lingerie of all kinds, but I've only gone for the bras. These things are awesome. I originally went for a particular dress, but let me tell you. I made a trip there not long ago and, well, take THAT gravity! And the prices may be a bit more than Victoria's secret - but these things are going to last forever. When you walk in, you might think you came to the wrong place because it's a small shop, parking can suck if anyone else is there, and when you first go in it almost just looks like a dry cleaners or something. All business. Great place to be fitted and know what a real bra should feel like. Nothing against many other places, but sometimes they are more worried about pretty than functional. While pretty is important, it's not the whole enchilada. And as I believe comics have said before me, no one is going to see a hot girl, take her home but then stop because her bra wasn't pretty enough - if ya know what I mean. The folks are always super nice but most important they are very professional. Expect them to want to see how it looks on ya - but know that you'll be getting honest opinions about fit and size in a way that your friends just can't give. Totally worth it.",positive
"This store is clean and easy to shop in. If your an ASU fan, this is the place to be. The staff is happy to help you find what ever you need. Prices are fair and I love the items from baby outfits to Adult attire, to great small gifts inbetween. I hate to call it a hole in the wall, just because it's small. This store is cleaner than most name brand shops and it's a local store that I love to support! Thanks for making shopping for ASU gear fun and exciting!!!",positive
"All the employees are friendly, outgoing, and attentive ! The owner and his wife are there nearly all the time trying to better their business and making friends with just about everyone within a mile radius ! I hear they are opening up a new store and cannot WAIT to go see the cool spot ! Much better merch than most places I see and always at a fair price. I will be going back for sure. It's where I get all my gifts. Sweet and simple choices !",positive
"I live in CA but travel to AZ quite often for games. The owner worked with me on some special orders to ensure we could pick them up on game day when we arrived in town. I have been in the store a dozen times to pick up ASU gear. They have a wonderful staff, a great selection and decent prices. The best part? The store is owned and operated by an ASU Alum. This is my go to spot for any and all ASU gear purchases.",positive
"The people that work here are always very friendly and helpful. It's a pretty small place, but they have a good selection of ASU stuff at decent prices. Great items always on sale. I got my dad a nice ASU Dad t-shirt for about $15 and a cute blouse for myself for 40% off. 2 hour free parking is available just north of this location in n open parking lot from 6 or 8 am - 6pm, I think Monday through Friday. Sorry, I've forgotten the exact days and start time. They also currently have stuff for the teams playing in the Insight Bowl.",positive
"It was a hard decision to give this place a 4 vs a 5. SG and I are A's fans. This place sells itself during Spring Training as a place to get all your Spring Training shirts and hats and stuff. BUT, they do not have any A's hats and almost no A's shirts. Come on guys, get some more A's stuff!!!!! They do have a great selection of ASU stuff for the locals and some really neat designs from the other teams that come down to spring training, hence the 4*. The owner, who is present in the shop, is very nice and very attentive to customers. The other staff are also very helpful. They have some great deals and some killer sales, so as long as you are not an A's fan, you will likely find just what you want!!!",positive
"These guys are legit. Their team of associates are all professionals...and not just in their business, as runners (triathletes). I have issues with planter fasciitis, surgically repaired Achilles tendon, and toenails missing/filling with blood. Recently increased shoe size and type of shoe. From another company's suggestion. Nope! Worked with Matt. He asked simple questions, then walked to the back pulled out a pair shoes... Had me do a light jog... and said, these are the shoes you need. Yup! My first run yesterday, total game changer! For any running questions or needs this is where you want to be. Thanks Cadence team... (Hope Dan dominated Boulder IRONMAN!)",positive
One of the best stores around! The employees are all top notch athletes who can get you in the shoes you need for your feet. They are very knowledgable and patient to help you find what you need in a shoe! Check out their weekly group runs,positive
"I love this store! I purchased some Altras around six months ago, and the rubber on the bottom started to peel away. These are pricey shoes, so I took them back to see if they had some glue on hand to fix them. They didn't, but they did fit me with a new pair and told me they would send the old pair back to Altra to make sure they knew of the defect. What amazing customer service, this is why I will ALWAYS go back to Cadence.",positive
I just bought a new pair of running shoes from these guys! They were so polite especially since I had a toddler in tow. Mom life can be hard for personal hobbies so buying a new pair of running shoes is a huge deal to me!!!! Love love my shoes can't wait for tomorrow's run! Thanks for listening to my shoe requirements and finding the perfect fit all while giving wonderful customer service. This is my new go to running store!,positive
"These guys are fantastic! They do much more than sell sports shoes, they analyze what your footwear needs are and truly work to find the best shoe for you.",positive
I went to cadence since they were the only place in the valley that had the Altra shoes I was looking for. I was blown away by the customer service I received. The employees were super knowledgeable and friendly and addressed all my very specific questions. They have the largest selection of altras of any store I've been. I will absolutely go back!,positive
"Beyond helpful and informative! Lindsay was very personable and helped us find the right shoe for our needs. My needs have changed since i was told that I over probate 13 years ago. I'm now a neutral shoe. Who knows how long I've been wearing the wrong type of stability shoe?! I'm so glad we found this place, and I don't think I'll be able to shop for my running shoes anyplace else because of the awesome service I received here.",positive
"This place is fantastic. They are attentive and knowledgeable. It will take an hour for them to find the right shoe for you, but in the end your feet will thank you.",positive
"I have put on some weight and need to get in shape but my old beloved tennis shoes are shot :( So I began my search for a new pair of tennis shoes that I am comfortable in and dont hurt my feet. ( I am not a runner but I been able to walk 3 miles but my feet swell up real bad at 1 and 1/2 mile. Thru recommendations I brought an expensive pair of new balance, worst decision ever -my feet sooo sore and I stopped working out because I was frustated and didnt want the pain. Talked to a friend who said keep at it --find another shoe --went to lots of average joe places couldnt find anything that felt comfortable. Finally went on line for running shoe stores and found Cadence among others and one day I was in the area and thought i would swing in -got there and thought crap this is a small runner store and I am not a runner -was gonna just turn around but Lindsey came up to me right away and began asking quesions so I thought ok have an open mind she is sweet be nice LOL -I explained about my last pair of shoes, she didnt put the brand dowm and asked if i heard about a new brand called altra (I think ) and i said no so she had me try them on -definetly felt way different than anything else I felt before, kind of weird and she explained why they felt weird and I wasnt quite sold on the weird feel-then told her about my problem spots that I experience when walking and she brought out several different shoes without caring about ""brand"" (although I did mention I like saucony and was told to get brooks-people are very loyal to their ""brands"" of shoes they use -LOL) I had the brooks all picked out but wanted to try one more pair I just wasnt that confident about actually pulling the plug and buying them and then be frustated again and I explained why I was not quite confident in that shoe and Lindsey had another pair for me -Winner! I feel in love with them and was excited and said Sold but they dont look like workout shoes I told her they look like my son's cool shoes he wears -not that i care about style but was suprised it was not the basis look of a ""running shoe"" it looks more like an everyday tennis shoe. Now I WANT to put these shoes on everyday and WANT to go walking again and that was huge for me! Thanks for making me feel comfortable Lindsey and not awakard being in ""runner store with my fat butt"" !!! It made a huge difference in my comfort level. Also want to mention three other things I really liked-1 she actually told me to go walk around outside the store -What???? just walk outside with these shoes on outside before I buy and it is ok lol I really liked that because I was able to feel what it was like walking around on the pavement and walk farther to get a real feel, 2 I still may come back for brooks to switch up shoes for different walking trails and she kindly gave me the information so I could come back (some places are like no we will keep it on file and tell you when you come back) so I really liked that and 3 she told me about their Tuesday group run and I was like you know I dont run and she was like no problem then walk which made me feel included and again not stupid for not being a runner :) So glad I took a chance on this ""runner store"" -no matter what activity you do or just need comfortable shoes it is worth it especially as I am getting older I need the comfort -:)",positive
"Terrific service! We came here after my nephew's track meet because he lost a couple of his track shoe spikes. The employee was very kind and screwed brand new ones for only 75 cents! He also gave us he heads up that when you buy shoes here, they make sure you get the perfect shoe based on fit and even let you test them. Store is very organized and sells great products. Will come back next time we buy running shoes for sure. Love supporting local businesses!",positive
"Matt and Lindsay were so great to my wife and I. I called first after being recommended to them by a friend who is an avid runner. Lindsay was very helpful over the phone and it really confirmed my decision to go in for a consult. My wife and have recently started becoming much more active but were both suffering from nagging injuries and getting really frustrated. Especially because we got fitted a large retailer that charged us a fortune for shoes and inserts that didn't end up helping. Matt and Lindsay could see right away what my wife and I needed by looking at our feet, how we stood, how we walked, and how we looked taking a quick jog. They recommend several shoes for us to try on to see what fit we preferred and gave us some great tips and resources on improving our running form. Their pricing was also great. Very comparable to Amazon but at Cadence you can actually try on the shoes and get some experts to fit you. Lindsay also told us about a fun community run they put on every Tuesday. Our experience was terrific and I look forward to giving them our business in the future.",positive
These guys are real pros. They absolutely know their stuff. They'll have you walk back-and-forth for quite some time and recommend a shoe which will fit right based on your gait. I've been to physical therapist and podiatrists. On four different occasions I've ordered orthotics. The pros at cadence have knowledge superior to these medical professionals when it comes to shoes.,positive
Amazing service. Helped my wife find the perfect shoe that fit her running style. Tried an many different shoes and with out asking they pulled shoes from their 40% sale on last years model. They never tried to up sale - it shows that they care about customer service and the love for the sport.,positive
Always a great experience when I go in for new shoes. Staff is always friendly and very knowledgeable when it comes to fitting you for the right shoe. I highly recommend Cadence Running Co.,positive
"Great little store with nice staff that are serious runners, meaning they know the gear. :) Good merchandise and everything you expect a specialty store to have.",positive
These guys are great. I have weird feet and I came in to get an assessment. Lindsey made a great recommendation for my funky gait but I was stubborn and went for the cooler looking shoe. I should have listened because the ones I picked hurt my calfs. I brought them back In and they made an exchange for the original recommendation with no issue. My wife ended up buying a pair for training for a tough muddier as well. Highly recommend this place if you need shoes for running or training!,positive
"Amazing service! Looked at my feet, I was running in a size way to small for me, and found the perfect shoe. I'll never go anywhere else for running shoes.",positive
"This place is amazing! We were sent here on the recommendation of a friend because I've had a lot of problems with my feet lately, and even though the guy that helped us was the only one there and multitasking between several customers, I still felt like he was addressing my individual needs perfectly. When we first got there he asked a ton of questions about what had been hurting me, how long, what shoes was I wearing, etc. He gave some suggestions and got me in a pair of shoes. He had me walk around in them and then watched me run in them and put me in several different pairs and repeated the same process, asking what I thought about them and giving recommendations each time. So helpful! The root of the problem was something that hadnt ever been suggested to me before so hopefully he's right and my feet will be better now. Overall I thought he was very professional and obviously knowledgeable. Will be coming back here next time I or anyone else in my family need shoes.",positive
"Went in for for a shoe recommendation and was very happy with the advice. The staff checked my stride and suggested four different shoes. Also discovered I wasn't stretching enough and it was affecting my form. If your serious about running, skip the warehouse sports store and stop by Cadence.",positive
"How can anyone NOT give this place 5 stars? My husband and I were first time customers and we both left extremely satisfied. The guy who helped us was knowledgeable, friendly, and most importantly...he listened to us! We never felt hassled or rushed and the amount of indivualized attention they seem to give each customer is hard to find nowadays. Great shop!",positive
"Snarky, obnoxious, ""know-it-all"" sales staff who get angry when customers ask follow up questions or disagree with their recommendations. Limited product lines and inventory. If you enjoy being talked down to and made to feel stupid, this is your store. Otherwise, don't waste your time or money on this place. Go to RoadRunner in Tempe. You can even get more knowledgeable, friendlier and better customer service at Sports Chalet or Dick's.",negative
"I moved to Gilbert from New Mexico, where I had a running shoe store analyze my gait and help me find some shoes to eliminate some stress on my extremely arthritic knees. I have been managing to buy the exact same model every 6 months on Amazon for the past 3 years but now it is not available. After reading the reviews from YELP, I called the store to ask if all of the employees were trained to fit shoes and did they only work arthritis sufferers. The man that answered the phone said that at least 1/2 of the customers never ran in their lives and all employees were trained. I went in and the lady that helped me recommended some new Asics Gel-Cumulus. My knee pain is much better. I had been wearing the Nimbus but the last pair just didn't help the pain much she said that everyone should get fit for new shoes often due to body and foot changes. I did not feel uncomfortable at all. I will be back in another year or two for another shoe fit check. Thank you.",positive
"went into the store after my podiatrist suggested I contact them for a shoe that would help my Planter fasciitis. Todd helped me and was very patient and knowledgable about the shoes he sells including shapes, fit, arches etc... he brought out different styles and shoes for me to try and even went out into the parking lot with me to walk around in them. It makes no difference if you are not athletic or a runner this guy knows his stuff!! The shoes I bought have helped me so much and the sock to help with the planter fasciitis was also a great investment! I would not hesitate to go back and have been handing out cards to the store since I left!!",positive
The store has a really bad return policy. I would never shop there again. My shoe had a whole after 3 weeks. It was a $156 Asics. I went to return it but Dan told me it was my fault and they will not return it. I told them they were brand new and his suggestion was to put duct tape on it. Really?? I told them that any other store would have returned these and they said we are not any other store and the manufacturer will not take it back. I called Asics and they said each shoe had a two year manufacturer's warranty and they were surprised to learn that the shop would not honor this.i mailed it to Asics and they took care of it. Needless to say will never shop local again netter to deal with a department store!!!,negative
"I started running a few months ago and found out that it is important to get the right shoe for you. I went to Dick's Sporting goods and Sport Chalet and they gave me totally different suggestions. Sport Chalet guy was dead wrong even though he used a treadmill and a camera. The guy at Dick's made sense and I was going to go with their recommendation and then I found out about this place. I really like how Matt took his time, explained everything and brought out various shoes for me to try. I was hesitant to go in the parking lot with these new shoes on when I knew I wasn't sure which one would I buy! But they are totally ok with that. This is how they sell their shoes. They want to make sure that you are comfortable running in them on the road and not just walking on the carpet. I tried three pairs and did not buy a single one that day. He was totally ok with that. I went back couple days later and got my Brooks Ghost 6 and I love them!! If you are serious about running, give this place a try!",positive
"Excellent, excellent, excellent! I had limited time to shop and really needed to get some new shoes. Dan understood that, looked at the worn out pair I was wearing and immediately could tell I was incorrectly placed into shoes that were all wrong for me. A dear friend accompanied me and could see the same thing and she wound up with a nice new pair for herself, too! I did not feel pressured to buy insoles and socks and VIP programs just to get additional discounts, nor was I roped into buying the most expensive shoes available. Instead, Dan asked what my application was (mostly gym, cross-training, running intervals) and he got my feet happy within 15 minutes. I wore my new shoes home and once I finished some errands, I promptly gave them a go with a short run in my neighborhood. First time in YEARS without knee or foot pain and I felt like I had a real ""spring in my step"" while running in a great pair of Newtons, a brand with which I had never been familiar. Hubby will be heading there this weekend to get his new shoes! THANKS, DAN!!",positive
Just stopped in and got a pair of shoes. They took their time and really helped get me into the right pair of shoes. The didn't up sell me on something I did not need. Overall a great experience. I recommend it to anyone needing a pair of running shoes.,positive
"The staff is incredibly helpful in finding the right shoe for you AND they have a 10% military discount. It's a small store, but they offer a good variety of merchandise. I love my Asics!!!",positive
"Dan and Matt are the best in the business. Dan has been running since college and still runs several races and triathlons each year. Matt has also been running forever and these two know everything about wearing the right shoe. If your kid just joined track for the first time, you haven't run in years and want to start again, or have never run and got suckered into a race, or think you know everything about running these guys will not disappoint, don't believe me, just ask some of the Olympic athletes that shop there. They can watch you take a few steps and just stand in your socks and can tell you what is the best type of shoe, after that it is just a matter of which one you like or feels the best. These guys and their customers are a wealth of knowledge. I learn something new every time I go in there!",positive
"If you're new to running or want to get more serious about your running, this is the place to get outfitted. Dan has been in the business for many years and has a wealth of knowledge about anything running and triathlon related. Best customer service and product knowledge. Get in here and get running!",positive
"the customer service was very poor!!! i bought a pair of shoes online as a surprise gift for my husband. they don't have a pick up option online so i called them to let them know that i'll just pick it up at the store. they told me just to go at the yorkville location and pick it up. i told my husband that i have to pick up something for myself. we drove all the way from north york to downtown, and the guy told me that i have to show him my id coz they have to photocopy it with the visa that i've used online. unfortunately, i didn't bring any id's with me that time just the visa that i've used and the confirmation email that they sent me online. i was like in shock when they told me that. they said it's for security purposes. but wth, the guy on the fone didn't mention bringing any id's. if the guy on the fone told me to bring id's then i could've brought one. anyways, the guy cancelled my order online and told me to just buy at the store. so i have to tell my husband the situation, and i have to tell my husband i bought shoes for him. surprise ruined!",negative
Overall a pretty good store if you are looking for sneakers in the Yorkville area. A lot of things were sold out in my size but I guess that comes with shoes being limited. Girl working at the shoes store was polite and helpful. They are also starting to carry women's footwear as well so overall a pretty good spot for sneakers,positive
"Capsule is definitely the worst sneaker store in and around Toronto PERIOD. If your down to play into the hypebeast then this place is for you, everyone else look elsewhere to satisfy your sneaker desires. If your going to call your self a Sneaker Boutique, the least you guys could do is actually carry the standard range of mens shoe sizes 8-13. The fact that you guys consistently never carry size 13 in your biggest brands (asics, New balance, Nike) makes your ""boutique"" a complete joke. I have asked in the past why they don't carry size 13's and have been told that ""our suppliers usually don't have any size 13's for the Canadian market, so if they are unavailable, we cannot get them"". Other sneaker shops in Toronto don't seem to have the same difficulty in getting size 13's which must mean Capsule gets the end of the line selections, or they stash away the size 13's before they hit the shelves If you want to buy sneakers in Toronto, I would check out: Solestop, Livestock, SVP, Groovy and Ugly Duckling (all except for Ugly Duckling located at Yonge and Dundas and Solestop Located in Pacific Mall) are located within a few blocks of the Queen and Spadina intersections) before making your way to the over hyped Capsule ""sneakerless"" boutique.",negative
"Capsule has been a staple shop in the Toronto street wear scene for many years. They carry a great number of classic street wear brands at standard Canadian retail prices as well as a few less-well-known brands. However, their problem isn't pricing or brand selection, it's sizing and employee attitude. As other reviewers have stated, they RARELY, IF EVER, have a size 13 in ANY shoe from ANY company. They carry nothing above an XL in any t-shirt/sweatshirt/top and the same goes for their selection of pants/bottoms. I understand that they cater to their customer base and what sells, however I am 6' 2"" and a big guy, many sneaker-heads and street wear aficionado's I know are well above a size XL in all clothes and most wear size 12 and up. I'm not expecting all sizes in every shoe from every manufacturer, but when the same shoes are available at Livestock or Groovy in size 13 and even size 14 on occasion, it makes you wonder what is really going on. This store is for people caught up in the hype. I suggest letting the 905-ers that make up the bulk of their Saturday sneaker release lines take the bait and local Torontonians shop elsewhere for their kicks and threads.",negative
Dope shop for those who like streatwear. Really small shop on the lower level kinda hard to find if your not looking for it. One of the remaining sneaker stores left in the city. They carry good brands stussy is pry the best. New bounce heat is also sold here and nikes of course. What sets it apart is the service. The guy knows what he's talking about and is happy to have a conversation with you. Talked to him for hours. He told me the history of the stores here owners how they opened ect. Great place worth the visit just to check it out. Great environment 5 stars unlike the other toronto stores.,positive
"Horrible customer service. I had walked in and was looking around, the girl at the counter asked if I had been fitted at the store, which I hadn't. But I have been fitted at other stores that cater to a wide range of bra sizes and I told her my size. She said to me in a very dismissive almost insulting tone that the size I told her 'means absolutely nothing here'. No further explanation as to why it means nothing. I understand that fit sometimes fluctuates based on different styles and designs but to not even acknowledge what I was saying and act so arrogantly, that's not exactly what I call customer service. Definitely will not be going back, there are lots of other places in Toronto that actually provide good customer service.",negative
If you know bras these are definitely subpar! Went with my mom and she got 2 and I got one. Hers broke after 2 wears and mine looks like it has been through war even though I take really good care of my bras. Let's not even talk about the fact that they get loose and don't fit properly after a couple of wears. Definitely not worth the money.,negative
"A friend and colleague of mine recently told me all about her favourite bra store. I nodded along and knew this sounded like a good sitch for me, but didn't think I'd actually ever make it in. Good in theory, never actually feeling like trying on bars in practice. Y'know? Then I heard about their current sale... Buy three bras, get two free. Nice, properly fitted bras. Yes, I spent a little over $300 there today, but I left with five bras that will last me a couple of years. All of the wins. The staff were kind, not pushy, and when helping with sizes they didn't make you feel molested. Five star boob day over here.",positive
"Came here a few days ago completely coincidentally and really liked the store and products. Got fitted by Renée (hope I've spelled your name correctly) who was absolutely wonderful, super efficient, and really friendly.",positive
"I just wanted to drop by and get a present for my significant other. Called first and mentioned the size I need... they confirmed they had them. So I walked in. Started browsing. 5min... 10min... COMPLETELY IGNORED. Finally a harried sales girl comes by and asks if I need anything. I said yes, and then she vanished again. Two other ladies walked into the store after me, and they got helped right away. I walked around for 5 more minutes and after STILL not getting any assistance walked out. So this store totally ignores guys walking in. Atrocious service. Even if the prices are ok, this complete disregard for common courtesy isn't worth the monetary savings. If I could give them a 0 rating I would.Stores like this do not DESERVE to stay in business. Walked into an adjacent store, Kallome Intimates, got greeted right away and got great customer service by multiple sales reps.",negative
My Canadian cousin has been raving that this place would change my life. She was more than correct. The fitting room gal sized me up and found me the perfect fit. It was a pleasant experience and she handled my unruly chest with confidence. I'm beyond pleased and wish this place existed in the States. I'll be back!!,positive
"I went in to find some bras, after having luck at the change in my hometown. The bras the sales lady gave me to try on we're the worst fit ever. The underwire was nowhere near my chest, the fabric was gapey - no good. She said it was a great fit but luckily I knew better and left. This store gets 2 stars because they were open on a Sunday, the staff was polite and they ended up pointing me to another lingerie store down the street that was far superior.",negative
"I went to Change for a change - I'm really sick and tired of expensive bras that are uncomfortable and don't fit. Pinching, poking underwires, fabric that's too stretchy in some areas, too tight in others, ""double boob"", ""back boob"" and all of the other fun symptoms of poor fitting bras. Ladies, I'm sure you know what I mean if you're also wearing these female torture devices. As soon as I walked into the store I was greeted by one of the employees behind the front counter, and welcomed into the store (check). She asked me if I had been to Change before, and when I said no, suggested a proper fitting (check). Once she had taken all of my measurements, she allowed me to stay in the fitting room and brought all of the sizes and styles to me (check), adjusting her selections to my preferences as we moved along. The result, a perfectly sized breast holster which doesn't pinch, and won't bulge in all of the wrong places. Bonus: with 'European Sizing', I left feeling like I have Dolly Parton sized boobs. It turned out that they had a great special on in the store (buy 2, get 1 free), so I left with 3 sets (holsters + undergarments) for $180. Realistically, this is no more (maybe less) expensive than Victoria Secret, but I have higher quality, properly fitted bras (check). As I checked out, I was offered enrollement into the Change loyalty program so that my size is saved, and I'll probably get emails for future specials, deals and events in the store (check). Also, for the guys - if your lady is enrolled, you can easily go lingerie shopping for her, and they will have her size on file. A great experience overall, and I will definitely go back.",positive
"A friend of mine is on Change's email list and invited me to shop their big sale with her at lunch today. It's been a while since I've had a specialty bra store I really liked (my favourite closed in 2008 and I've been making do with department store brands since), so I was up for checking it out. And now I'm sold! There's no way I'm going back, especially not at these sale prices. (The more you buy, the more you save--I ended up buying two of the bra I liked best, partly so I'd always have one even if The staff is friendly, knowledgeable, and enthusiastic, and the quality of the bras on offer seems very good. They've got a wide range of sizes, which is great for those of us who wear a small band and large cup size.",positive
The only thing I can buy there is their thongs. They are the most comfortable thongs I have ever owned. They don't give you a wedgie! ha! Their bras are European sizes so nothing fits me there. Online they have larger sizes but I don't buy online. The staff are very nice. The store is well kept.,positive
"The store is small but it has great lighting and the bras are all neatly displayed out. I went in and I had to awkwardly wait a few minutes until the sales girl acknowledged me, but she was very helpful. Maybe she was tired? She could tell my cup size just by looking at me and brought out all these bras to try on and they were great. I've got an awkward figure but the bras were nice and I was really happy with the ones I chose. However, I did notice a small rip in one the bras when I took it home so make sure to completely check the bras and take your time. In the changing room, I overheard all the other sales girl helping other people and they were all friendly and nice. When I went to purchase them, I realized I forgot my credit card but I was still able to buy them as I just called home for the number. It's strange though because on the original receipt the total was 134 but on the small bill stapled on top, it says 143. I called and they said come in and we'll check it out but it's a far trip so whatever. They were having a sale so I got two bras and then one free but I still ending up spending a lot! It's so unfair that the bigger bras cost more, but their prices are about the same as a department store and waaaaay less than those boutique ones so I gotta deal. They actually had a strapless bra for my size but it was $90 so I didn't buy it :P I'll definitely be coming back for some more bras. I want to try their sport ones. Bra shopping use to make me so depressed but now I'm excited for my next purchase!",positive
"I came here one year ago I guess. I looked for a bathing suit at that time. The sale person was friendly and gave me good recommend. I wish there were more variety of bras. Anyway, I would check it out again..",positive
"Normally when I tell a salesperson my size (large cup, small band), she giggles nervously and suggests some store down the street... First time I saw a Change store, I walked in, proffered my size, and waited for the nervous titter. Instead, I got ""Sure!"" and shown the most amazing collection of nice looking samples in real-woman sizes. I was there at the end of a month-long sale so they had a limited number in my size. ""Only"" 11. Most larger bras resemble those leather slings on the front of cars - ""car bras."" Change's stuff is all nice-looking (though I'd stay away from the embroidered, the patterns show through thinner shirts). Today I brought a family friend, a large-chested teen who never had a good bra, in. I introduced her with ""I've been telling this lady about this new fad, where bras actually fit..."" They whisked her into a room, did a proper fit, showed her how to try them on PROPERLY (no one but Change -ever- does that), and brought her bra after bra. She narrowed it down to two, but could have picked up half a dozen and still left a good few behind. She then went home and Facebook'ed about the new experience of having a bra that FIT. So. - WIDE range of sizes, from the very large to the very small, including most of the odd sizes few companies bother with. - Well-fitting - Both lined and unlined bras. - A good selection of colours and patterns, as well as standard black, white & nude (covering most people's tastes). - A frequent buyer club that means all your purchases are at least 10 per cent off. - Frequent sales, from buy one, get one half off to 50-70 per cent off everything in the store. Their regular prices are a little higher than some, but in three years, I've never paid full-price for anything there.",positive
"Change is a bra shop that's been open for about 5 years on Queen West, but due to the lack of need for a lot of basic T shirt bras, I never walked through the doors. The biggest bit of advice would be to improve the display in the front- make it more obvious what the real draw here is. I was told about the range of sizes from a tiny but generous friend- girls, you know what I mean? She ended up with some ridiculous size that I've never heard of. So, today, I walked in and guess what? I, too, walked out with a ridiculous size. I've always known most women walk around with an ill-fitting bra. Ladies, this place is great at finding at least one soutien-gorge that will fit. But, you might not get the exact style you wanted, or the color, or the size you think you want. So, hurray for Change, but be prepared to compromise. After wearing it around for a day, my friend asked me why I'm squeeky like poutine cheese. It's my new bra, I'm not 100% on the fit nor the material its made of. Oh well, better luck next size.",negative
For gals like myself that are blessed in their upper region.. This Is the place to go! The sales associates are so nice! They are going to actually size you right and make sure you leave happy!! Goodbye Ill fitting bras and hello happy chest heaven! My girls are so happy for their lingerie!,positive
"I've been to this store several times now and have always received good service. They carry a wide range of sizes and have both a good selection of basics and fashion bras. Occasionally the quality of the bras can be hit or miss. Change sometimes uses scratchy laces and threads, so it is really important that you run your fingers over every part of the bra to make sure it is smooth and soft. I have bought a few bras without doing this and ended up only wearing them once or twice before I got rid of them - but the bras I have checked over carefully in store have ended up being the bras I wear the most. Be careful when shopping here (take your time!) and you will end up with properly fitting bras that you love.",positive
"At first when the sales girl guessed me at a 28G I was rather offended, mortified and heart-broken. I wanted to be a C darn it. But man, did I switch my tune after she took me back to the change room to properly measure me and show me the difference a properly fitting bra makes. Two years later I am a devotee and rave the blessings that Change has bestowed upon me, my mom, my grandma, and my friends. So many lingerie stores cater to the ""typical"" sizes, y'know anything in a rib size 32-36, and in cups from A-D. But as with most concepts of what ""typical"" is in the fashion industry, this is of course completely wrong. Most of us seem to be going about with ill-fitting undergarments that don't flatter us in the least. But HERE it is heaven. Whatever size you are, they got it or they will get it. I can actually buy cute bras here and I don't have spillage or look gigantic from super-molded cups that seem so popular these days. They even carry swimwear, which for busty girls is awesome. No way am I tossing on a suit that doesn't have some support. My girly lumps need a lift and some restraint so they don't go bobbing about everywhere when I try to do anything remotely fun on the beach. Thank you Change and all the staff for making women's lives better, one undergarment at a time. XO",positive
"LOVE this place. I originally went in looking for a sports bra, but ended up coming out with the much cuter sister, the demi bra! I was instantly put at ease by the girls who worked there, and was asked if I'd like a measurement - YES YES YES! Who the hell knew I'm a massive D cup, baby! and 32 around! I've been wearing my bra size ass-backwards for years and years ... here I thought I was a 38B! The pricing isn't what I'd consider cheap, compared to La Senza. But the quality is by far superior. All of the undergarments are soft, lush & feel much more substantial than the usual 'Buy 3, Get 1 Free"" bras. It was also nice to see they had a full range of sizes - including plus sizes. I also don't feel like I should have my legs wrapped around a pole wearing these bra & thong sets. I'm over the days of cheap looking sequin bras, and appreciate a more simplistic, romantic feel everything in the store has.",positive
"After having two babes and a combined two and a half years of breast feeding (yes ladies, your boobs will get softer and seemingly droopy after all of this, it's true), I have finally found what so few women do. A fantastically fit bra! Who needs breast surgery when you have the perfect bra? La Senza is the pits when it comes to fit; Secrets From Your Sister was a difficult experience for me from fit to their professionalism on a few occasions but Change, wow I absolutely love these guys. While the styles all sit differently I have found one to knock 'em dead. I now feel a lot more confident in my self and appearance and didn't realize it wasn't there to begin with until I had the tight bra. Oh, and the staff are whip it, on it and non judgmental. You guys rock, so glad you are there :)",positive
"Rude awakening. That is what I had... and it's bloody fantastic! Perhaps some men might read this and think ""What's the big deal? Sure, women look sexy in lacy underwear and bras. No need to have a parade about it."" Well sir.... shaddup! What makes this place stand out? A) The staff is very helpful, friendly and knowledgable (I learned a lot about what to look for in a bra). B) Moreso, it's not just a ""How does that feel? Let me know if you need anything. See you at the counter."" These ladies know the value of a good-fitting bra. Considering I [apparently] didn't know any better, Racquelle would make suggestions and come back with more sizes to ensure I left as a completely satisfied and fully supported customer. C) They offer Italian macaroons in the fitting room D) They offer more than your standard A, B and Cs For me, there is no need to look any further to replenish my clearly tiny bra collection - and not just because most other bra stores don't carry anything higher than DD. This shop is a welcoming place with a staff that doesn't judge... they understand.",positive
I love these bras. Such a great fit. Secrets from your sister carries some of their stuff and then they opened an entire store which is wonderful. Good lingerie is an investment!,positive
"I was really excited to visit this store given the good reviews on Yelp, but was hugely disappointed by clothes that appeared dirty, very used and made of poor quality. I also don't understand what could possibly justify the high markup on their items. I suggest purchasing consignment from ebay instead.",negative
"Love it. Lives up to the hype imo. I was suspicious because you never know, you know? I know. Stopped here while perusing pretty much every vintage shop in the Plateau/Mile End area. I wish they had a larger selection, but their stuff is pretty unique and fairly priced. Aside from your general vintage fare, they also have a variety of re-worked items- which actually are super cute and cool ( you know how sometimes vintage spots ~modify~ dresses by just like, taking out the shoulder pads and then charging $50? it wasn't like that). Also they had hilarious lil tchotchkes (i hate that word but it seemed most appropriate) such as a lighter with an image of Kanye making out with himself (best believe I bought it) and postcards adorned with old pics of Celine Dion herself with phrases like ""kiss my ass"" underneath (also bought those, obviously) Cashier was a very stylish and pretty and friendly girl, naturally. Will def come back!",positive
"Let's be honest... I hate sorting through crap at vintage shops. Citizen Vintage is curated. The owner has a point of view and picks the clothes accordingly. THANK YOU. And so, you can definitely expect to find something cool. Less of a hunt. Some pieces are modified as well and there are a few products from local designers. A+. 4 because it can be a bit pricey for what you are buying. It is second hand, not true vintage, after all.",positive
"This place is truly a find, and it was hard for me not to spend all my money here on vacation. I tried on almost every dress they had and a few pairs of shorts and ended up buying a pair of shorts and a really pretty dress. It's a bit pricier but they do tailor many of the items themselves. Overall, I liked it a lot here and would definitely come back (especially if I had a higher paying job ;). They also gave me a 15% student discount!",positive
"Citizen Vintage is yet another great little vintage shop in Mile End. You'd think at some point they'd hit saturation and it would no longer be fun to look in them. You'd think that, but then guess what? You'd be really wrong. Citizen Vintage has a smaller selection than some of the bigger vintage shops and has some great consignment pieces too. They also have a great selection of sizes which is nice. The woman working in the store was really lovely and told us a bit more about some of the more unique items and suggested some other places to visit in Montreal.",positive
"Everyone likes a good vintage store. It's like having a personal shopper bring the best digging to one place and pre-cleaning the goodies. The comparison is especially accurate in the case of Citizen Vintage. The three girls who own it started channeling their vintage love by doing popup shops in various locations. They hand pick and steam everything themselves. In this high-volume-vintage-demand age, it is a relief. They have certainly picked the ultimate location in this case, a wide and widely lit ex-antique furniture store, now showcasing colourful and quality embellishments for both men and women. It has adopted the hang-by-colour type of display design that a lot of stores seem to cherish these days and which is very pleasing to the eye. The shoe bazaar is magnifique, especially the leopard creepers from Hush Puppy featured on their blog. A funny detail and a blink to store design: the school lockers where some miscellaneous olympics garments hang effortlessly... this is exactly what you want your vintage look to achieve.",positive
"My first few days in Montreal left me disillusioned by the many many thrift shops all around. I wanted to find a place with great picks and reasonable prices. Citizen Vintage fits this void as looking through stock, I could tell each piece was different and unique. There wasn't a clutter of random pieces. There was a consistent feel of comfortable, chic pieces at decent prices.",positive
"Super cute spacious shop in a great location right next to Sparrow (which makes for a lovely brunch and shopping outing, or a shopping and drinks outing. Or both! Big day!) Zero stress staff, cute quirky styles, looked to be mostly 80s and 90s garments in good shape priced around 20$-60$ but I think the fab ladies who own this place have some other tricks up their sleeves for future seasons (and by tricks I mean bags of clothes). Notable: rows of great shoes, and a sizeable men's section.",positive
"What a great edition to the growing number of vintage shops in Mile End! As a vintage connoisseur, I was pleased to see just how much care Citizen vintage puts in to selecting and presenting their wares. The staff are friendly, the prices are more than reasonable and the styles are always a cut above what you find in other places. Will definitely be shopping there again!",positive
"Fantastically designed and curated store for all your vintage needs in Montreal. Prices that really don't even belong on that street. Super affordable, impeccable selection!",positive
"For my sons 21st birthday I wanted to make him a baseball jersey so I had seen this store for quite a while and decided to see if they could help me. From my first interaction with their staff everyone was extremely friendly and helpful. I was only ordering one jersey and they treated me like I was ordering enough for an entire league. They took my design for a logo, established date etc and made me an awesome button up jersey that looked professional and classic. I even was late to the party on ordering it and they still made sure I was able to have it in time, going as far as meeting me before they opened so I could get it before I went out of town. Class all the way around and highly recommend using them for any of your baseball/softball/cool gift ideas. Thanks again to the entire team for making my vision become a reality!!",positive
"These guys are fantastic. Super friendly, helpful and informative. They even took care of my son's glove at no charge following a blowout. Thank you cleats!",positive
Stopped here while visiting from Ohio. The workers were very nice and helpful. Had to search but found some decent deals for our 3 baseball playing boys.,positive
Cleats is the best! Our daughter pitches and we have exchanged 2 sets of Mizuno metal cleats. Both were coming apart at the seams and they happily replaced them each time. Great friendly and knowledgeable staff! We buys all our softball gear from Cleats!,positive
"Hey CLEATS you guys are great! Thanks for having everything that we need for our 7 year old Football player even though its not Football season! What a concept, carry equipment even when its not in season! Great idea. I think the other large chain athletic places ( sports authoricrap and DICKSucks sporting goods) should take a Que from you! THANKS! 4.5 stars in my book...Took away one little stare because you all didn't have the exact size we needed but had one close enough! And my kid is tiny so its not your fault i am sure!",positive
These guys have been great to me over the years. I've bought all my baseball equipment here and they've always supported our Little League. Good Guys with good stuff.,positive
"I love this store. They always have a good variety of items, most of which are only lightly worn and of good quality. So much cheaper than buying new! And more sustainable. Of course they don't always have something that hits home for me, but the great part is, there is good turn-over so you're bound to find something next time. The fun is in the hunt! Thanks.",positive
"Love,love,love this store they're not like your regular consignment shop they have clothes in size xs-xxxl. And so many in shoes and handbags .Everything is in good to new shape",positive
"Garments are clean. Everything is hung by style, size and color. Gorgeous handbags. Nice fitting rooms. They offer to help you or hold things you've picked out to try on. They hang it all in the fitting room for you. They have a loyalty program too. This is like a full retail store with thrift shop prices! 5 stars and a smooch for it being next to a froyo shop.",positive
"I stopped on to grab a few things for my work wardrobe. I am disappointed in the selection. I likely won't be back, however I do get that their selection is based on what they purchase from the public. I suppose disappointed was a strong word; more like underwhelmed. Staff was ok. They have shoes and name brand purses. Still selling about 200. Nah. I'll pass;-)",negative
"Nice and clean, a good place to shop and look around. My only complaint/suggestion is to come down on the price of the handbags. Almost like paying retail...the prices on the bags are insane!",negative
"Strike 3------- you're out! Clothes Mentor has always been hit or miss with me. I love a great bargain, I like to hunt down a great outfit for a fraction of the cost but I will avoid clothes mentor from now on and save the frustration. Earlier I received a text for 20% off entire purchase, SCORE, right? So before I make time and load the kids in the car i call just to get a gauge on their Lululemon selection. The young lady who answered today basically said, ""I'm not sure.......I don't know.......you'll have to check the racks yourself."" It's a Monday, it was noon and she could have easily just said something like, ""oh my gosh, we always have a great selection of Lulu or similar brands! We don't hold an inventory of specific items but is there something in particular you had in mind and I can quickly browse?"" There's a HUGE difference in tone of voice and pure laziness. She just wanted me off the phone. Sadly, this is not the first time the store has had complaints on lackadaisical employees and not my first time experiencing it. Honestly, it was just the first time I decided to write about it. Head on over to uptown cheapskate a 1.5 miles up the road!",negative
I can't believe what an amazing consignment store this is. The goods are neat and clean and celebrated name brands are abundant. If you want a high end handbag or high end workout clothes this is definitely the place to do! I have also resold some items here. They have many opportunities to get a discount on items and they will send 10% off to your phone. I am really enjoying my wardrobe now thanks to them. The girls that work her are helpful and sweet! Don't miss out!,positive
"This place is much better than many of the consignment shops I've been too. They gave me a decent price on some designer items I brought in, and I was happier than I've been in the past at other stores. Their selection of clothes is more than decent, most of everything is designer and/or brand new or gently worn. The ladies behind the counter were super nice and quick to assist. Their prices were a little higher than I've seen at other places but there are quality items that are worth it. I'll be going back to sell and shop.",positive
"I am definitely a fan! They have PLUS-SIZED fashionable clothes. My daughter and I are over the moon. I found this place 2 months ago and have already been back several times. I also follow their Instagram page and drove over there immediately after they posted a cute pair of shoes! Love this place, makes bargain-shopping fun :)",positive
"I've been shopping at Clothes Mentor for the past year. I love it so much ! I love new clothes but hate the mall. All those hours of shopping, not finding anything most of the time and the prices are ridiculous. This store has a great variety of styles and brands and the prices beat the best sale rack you could find in a mall. Jewelry, wallets, purses, they have everything. I almost don't want to share this! My wardrobe is huge now and didn't cost me an arm and a leg or take up an entire Saturday. The girls are really helpful and friendly too. They know the store like the back of their hand. When I was in a hurry I just told one of them what I was looking for and they knew just where to find it. They offer their opinion when I need it. Girls you know how it is when your shopping by yourself and your not sure how something looks! It's like shopping with your girlfriends",positive
"When I lived in Virginia Clothes Mentor was my go to place to buy and sell. This was my normal experience at the Virginia Clothes Mentor. 1 - Turn in my clothes for consideration. 2 - Shop/try on/watch stack of what I want to buy grow. 3 - Receive $80 to $100 for clothes accepted. 4 - Spend $80 to $100 on clothes. I was so excited to find a Clothes Mentor near me in Arizona. Sadly I have found nothing to buy. The prices are surprising high for a second hand store. They must give you more for the clothes you bring in? No, they give you less. Customer service is beyond terrible! Do not ask them to come out from behind that counter! EVER! My friend was feeling faint and we asked for some water. Blank stares from the girls behind the counter. Luckily another customer had some water in her car and ran to get it. So you have one customer sitting on the floor with their head between their knees. The other 4 customers in the store tending to this customer's medical needs. Employees? Behind the counter talking to one another.",negative
"SO SAD AND CONFLICTED!!!! Never been here, or even heard of this store before tonight. I was really excited since it is in a great location for me. I really wanted to buy and sell here, because when I stepped in I easily saw 20 things I would purchase :( I desperately wish my experience would've been pleasant so this could be my new favorite store, instead I don't know if I'll ever come back. I was immediately approached by an associate, who asked if I wanted to sell, I said yes. Then the lady stepped behind a register as if to help me, but no. She then informed that their buyer had gone home at 6pm and apparently no one else is allowed to buy. However, I could leave my clothes behind-huge liability, no way. AND REALLY??? Invest in your employees! Are they not worth training? Is this some sort of control issue? It's really inconveniencing and doesn't make the employees look competent or professional. The associate also said that I can go over to a competitor and try to sell there instead!! Hahaha what??? Please train the employees! Please. They are literally sending customers away! I calmly told the sales girl how disappointed I was, and how I wanted this to be my new go-to spot, but I don't see that happening. She shook her head all disgusted when I left, she even made sure I saw her do it when I got in my car. I feel like I can't come back simply on principle, incredibly flawed process and snotty workers. I really want to do business with Clothes Mentor! All that needs to happen is the buyer needs to stay until closing time, or more employees need to be trained on buying and customer service! SERIOUSLY, Ryan or Amy, please reach out to me and tell me how this will change in the future and would give it another go.",negative
"Great experience first time selling no problems, lovely ladies helping me. So much to choose from the store is well keep and a pleasure to shop in. I will differently be a returning customer. Thanks",positive
"There is so much to choose from! I was able to buy 15 items for $138, and most were Ann Taylor. There is no way I could have afforded a new wardrobe I can be this excited about for the money. The other reason I shop Clothes Mentor no matter what city I am in? Choices! I needed a nice, classic pair of black shorts. I was able to try on 7 different high end brands in my size and was able to choose the one that was the best fit. Amazing!",positive
The quality of the clothes is great and everything is priced fair! Other consignment stores have clothes that are worn out looking and over-priced. This is by far the best quality consignment store I've been to.,positive
"Clothing for women sizes 2-8 is okay, however the for women sizes 10 and up is inferior at best. They do have an excellent selection of designer bags and wallets, but they could be priced at little better, as if you are an individual that shops special designer bag events you can get better prices. When it comes to selling clothing, I don't understand the ""method to their madness."" I would also expect the staff to present themselves more professionally. All in all this shop is sub-par.",negative
i love their prices and selections on what they decided to buy. Everyone who works there is very nice and friendly and I love to get a great deal on cute clothes! Shannon who works there is so nice and I will go back because of her!,positive
"Was not greeted when I came in with my family, but other people were that were Caucasian as we we're not. Strong horrible scent couldn't enjoy looking around.

"I've never purchased resale items. But, when they opened up and was featured on TV I had to check them out. I am really impressed with the quality, price, and selection. My daughter outgrew her Hunter boots and I was hesitant to purchase a new pair because of fast she is growing. If someone boxed it up in a Hunter shoe box, and gave it as a gift I would never thought it game from a resale establishment. I couldn't believe the inventory they have and the range of sizes. If you're looking for women's clothing, accessories, bags, and shoes....THIS IS THE PLACE! They have a customer for life!",positive
"Love this store! Great selections at great prices and super friendly staff, always whilling to help. What more can you ask for!? By far overall best service I've received at a retail store.",positive
I'm not sure how this place is still in business but they charge more than the Lululemon outlet for items that are not new. I willing to pay more for better quality items but The cheapest pair of Lululemon bottoms that they had for sale was $68. Last years style. Not awful condition but definitely thread worn tanks? $36. I'll stick with My Sisters Closet for realistic pricing They did have a nice selection of things but again the price is untouchable. Also upon entering the smell of the perfume permeates everything. It smelled as if someone had gone around and smashed bottles of cheap perfume immediately before I came in.,negative
This place is useless. 90 percent of the time no matter even if you give fresh unused clothes that are currently trending they don't seem to take it. Each associate gives a different explanation. I have never had a good experience selling. And the smell inside sucks. When you come outta the store you are surely to get a headache.,negative
"Love buying and selling clothes here, they give a great, fair price for what is brought in and they have a huge selection of like new merchandise. My only complaint is the fragrant smell that permeates through everything. It's very strong and very difficult to remove from clothing and handbags. Otherwise, I will always shop here for great deals!!",positive
What a great place! I come all the way from East Mesa to get a great outfit. The prices are great and they always have new things coming in.,positive
"This store always sprays very strong perfume. it is so bad that it is truly a health hazard, I have asthma and could not be in there for one minute, before going outdoors and using my inhaler-same thing happened last time I was there, this is very bad for the customers and the employees lungs, I have told them this but it does not change! I would suggest staying out of there",negative
"It was a fantastic sale Friday from 5-7, all yellow tags up to $10, on sale $3. Over $10 sale price only $5. What a sale, plenty to choose from, lots of yellow tags, quality items and clothing color & size coordinated. Their were lots of folks who came out to the sale. We all had a joyous time, there were snacks and water and two drawings. The 7 0'clock drawing gave away a beautiful designer bag. Everyone needs to visit this lightly used clothing & accessories store. The quality of all things is superb. I have been there several times, always leaving with great stuff! Oh yeah Ladies, they also have a large variety for the big girls like me. That makes me happy, happy, happy. Ladies at your earliest convience, check out Clothing Mentor on Ray Rd., you'll love this store. You can also bring in you well maintained items for cash on the spot at anytime.

"Clothes Mentor is a Womens Resale store for all women sizes 0-26, petites and maternity. They sell better brand-name ""gently-used"" women's fashions and accessories. I am sooooo thankful this store is in our area. I've been able to update my wardrobe for fall for a fraction of the cost of other stores. One of the items I bought still had the tags on! Have already referred two friends there and they scored as well. Please note: I am plus sized. They are small so you can see that just about anyone can shop there! Check out the website for some of the ""looks"" you can buy there - business and casual, smart and stylish apparel, shoes, purses and accessories. Plus, if you bring items in, they pay you CASH on-the-spot unlike a consignment shop, where you may wait weeks to receive payment. I've watched this process happen - it is seamless. I will bring my first items there this week and will review how it goes.",positive
"Whenever I am in Madison I make a stop at Contours. Thanks goodness family and business get me there often enough to keep me stocked up! A custom bra fitting is life changing. It enhances your posture and shape and makes you look way more put together. I put it on the same level as eyebrows... ever see anyone who only does their own maintenance? A professional set of eyes is a must! Since our bodies and our ""girls"" change like with only a few lbs of weight loss or gain a bra wardrobe is a good thing to have.",positive
"Had a bra that didn't work-- Exchange policy was quick and easy. They took me back to the dressing room to find one that did work and I only paid the difference in price. Thanks, Contours!",positive
"I was hooked after my first visit. It was hard to find cute bras in bigger sizes, but they have them here with over 180 sizes. Plus with the right size the wires don't bother me anymore.",positive
"Really between a two and three. I am an uncommon size and have never really owned a bra that fits properly. Last year I decided I needed to be an adult and invest in something that fits. Contours prides itself on being able to fit any body and they offer extremely personalized service. I stopped in on a whim one afternoon and they had space to accommodate me for a fitting. Contours doesn't keep bra stock out on their main floor, so I highly recommend scheduling a fitting ahead of time to ensure you can be seen. You can't just browse and find your own size; after chatting with one of their fitters and being measured you'll be brought an array of items to try on. On the day you go, wear the bra that fits you best/you like the most, and prepare to spend a lot of time topless with a stranger. The booths are private, but the associate stays with you as you try things on and helps make sure you a) know how to put on a bra properly [aka not clipping it in the front and wrenching it around to put the clasp in the back], and b) are on the right hooks and strap length. For me it was kind of being like being at the doctor - it's their profession so it wasn't weird being half naked, but I definitely wasn't expecting it, either. My main issue is having bra bands that roll - it's uncomfortable and looks terrible under clothes. I expressed that to my consultant and her response was that every bra does that and it's just something all women have to deal with. This sent up red flags for me and I should have listened to my instincts, but I continued with the fitting. After several different brands and styles, I found one that felt good in the changing room and seemed to fit well - no gaps or pinches. It was about twice what I typically pay at a department store, but I decided that if it was actually going to fit it was worth it. I added a few more styles I liked to a wish list that they can keep at the store for you, and made my purchase. Contours does have a unique return policy. This review is about a year overdue so it may have changed/I might be misremembering, but I believe returns are for store credit if unworn, and if worn they'll credit you 50% of what you paid toward the purchase of a new item. I'm not personally a huge fan of this, but I felt like it was clearly explained before I made my purchase. The policy is posted in the store, my consultant verbally said it, and when I checked out it was on my receipt and the person working the desk also asked if I understood the policy or had any questions. Now, why am I not a fan? Even though my purchase felt great in the store and great for about the first half hour I wore it later that week, the band rolled just like every other bra within an hour of putting it on. If I'm going to have the exact same issue as the bras I can find in a department store (and that I specifically brought up to my consultant in hopes of solving), I don't see the point in spending the extra dough. I hemmed and hawed about returning to try another bra, but I can't afford to keep buying style after style to see if they'll hold up. I guess I could try to hang around the store while wearing it for longer, but that seems like a weird thing to do. On a positive note, the bra did fit better overall, and if the band wouldn't have rolled I would have been extremely happy with my purchase. So, very long story short: if you don't have a lot of issues with bras this is a great place to find extended sizes and custom service; if you have major fit issues on a small budget think carefully before making a purchase since you won't be able to return or exchange for the amount you paid.",negative
"My girlfriend absolutely swears by this place. We've lived in Portland, Oregon and Columbus, Ohio, and this is still the bra shop she prefers to go to whenever she needs new stuff. Why? There simply aren't enough good bra shops out there, and the ones that are there tend to work in extremely limited sizes. This place doesn't. She loves the service, is happy with the prices, and always comes home with a smile (and honestly, so do I).",positive
"I only get an hour long lunch break, and I was hoping to get a bra fitting in that time. This place is a fifteen minute drive from my office, so if I got a half-hour fitting it could have fit in my schedule. I called ahead to see if I schedule an appointment. The woman on the phone said she wasn't taking any appointments for mid-day that day, but if I came in I could probably just get a fitting right then and there. I asked her if she was busy now or if it was normally busy fifteen minutes from now and she said no. I arrived, and I saw one woman walking toward the store as well. If I had wanted to be a jerk, I could have ran to the door and beat her to it, but I did the non-jerky thing and just held the door open for her, so she walked in the door first. Turns out she was going there for a bra fitting as well, and there was only one attendant on at 11:30am when we were there. The woman said I could stay and wait for her to be done with the other woman, but those appointments are a half hour long, so I declined, fuming that I had wasted my lunch freak and didn't even have any food during it. I looked around, but the prices seemed exorbitant. In the end I wound up going to Soma in West Towne mall for a fitting and then buying extra bras at WalMart.",negative
"In an ideal world, we would all have professional stylist and tailors to tell us how to accentuate our natural curves. Since most of us are not that lucky, our best option is to hope that the sales associates at generic stores can assist us. I am a very busty lady with a relatively small waistline which makes it a nightmare for me to find bras that fit correctly. I have been searching for a bra to wear with a fancy dress and after trying out 2 major lingerie stores in Madison, I was told that neither carried my size. One associate was kind enough to suggest going to Contours since they apparently have a wider range of sizes. So I stopped by Contours today on my lunch break with little-to-no expectation of being able to find a bra. I was surprised to find out that not only do they carry my size (which at the time I believed to be a 36G) but was also thrilled to hear that they carried bras all the way up to HH (and possibly higher?). When I walked in I was able to look around for a few minutes before someone was able to help me. Don't be fooled when you look around. They have all the lingerie on display but all of their bras in the back of the store. After a short wait I was prompted to go into a fitting room where the owner of the store proceeded to measure me. [Side Rant]Let's stop for a minute to address some others claims of the associates being ""handsy"". This is insane. How in the world can you expect someone to fit you for a bra if they are unable to actual touch you in any way? In addition, a professional will want to touch the bra and also show you how to get your breasts situated correctly so that person can see whether or not it is fitting correctly. Bras are a tricky thing. It's all about how the weight is distributed between your waist and shoulders. Most women (myself included) have found bras that distribute the majority of the breast weight on the shoulders. This usually results in back, shoulder, & neck pain and potentially headaches and migraines. What a good bra should do is distribute more weight to your waist so there isn't so much on your shoulders. Now tell me this: how is a professional bra fitter suppose to tell if the weight is being distributed correctly if that person is unable to ""touch"" the bra or your boobs? [/Side Rant] I was surprised when I found out that my waist was actually a 32 and the cup was H/HH. I was even more surprised when she brought in about 15+ bras in an assortment of styles and colors that were all in a 32 HH! Never in my life have I had so many options to choose from when bra shopping (it was a really good feeling). I tried on several bras and the owners told me what bras would be appropriate for what clothing (t-shirt, v-neck, button-down, etc). She also helped me find a bra that would work with the dress that I had. She had me try on some bras with the dress, and what I really appreciated was that she talked me out of a strapless bra because lets face it...HH is a lot of weight to support without any straps. So she told me what minimal alteration I would need to do to the dress to wear a regular bra with it. This was a major bonus for me because I hate that feeling of buying a strapless bra for that ""one time"" I need it. Now I can buy and wear a comfortable bra with a fancy dress and no one will know the difference! All-in-all, I walked out of that store with 4 bras and an incredibly nice gift from the owner. Both the owner and other staff member were very polite, helpful, and really passionate about getting me fitted correctly. You don't see that level of dedication from just any ""generic"" lingerie store. I felt empowered when I left and will most certainly be going back. Summary: Give it a try with an open-mind and you will be pleasantly surprised.",positive
"I had read a few negative reviews about the store but decided to check it out after a friend had good things to say. When I arrived at the store I was greeted by two people. One was clearly the owner and I immediately didn't like her attitude. She said she didn't have time to ""make up fake reviews"" when I mentioned I had read a few negative reviews. I was happy to have the other individual size me. The positives are they do appear to have a large selection based on the bras she brought me. But that's where the positives end. The negatives. I'm not convinced the bras fit me very well. I've been measured before and have always been told the area between the cups should sit flush on your chest. This lady said it doesn't have to. I feel like I'm spilling out a be but the employee told me to just tuck in my boobs a bit more. She also measured me to be a smaller cup than I'm currently wearing. I thought I would take a chance and paid a small fortune for three bras. Got home and did some comparison pricing online and found them MUCH cheaper on almost every site..generally around $25 cheaper. In the end it's my fault. I haven't worn them and I know their return policy, I can't return them. Won't be going back.",negative
"Victoria was extremely helpful knowledgable and listened to what I was looking for. I hesitated on purchasing because of price, but upon further bra shopping will probably go back for the bra that fit me best and was same price as elsewhere.",positive
"I bought bridal lingerie and they were very clear about pointing out the store policy of returns only for store credit. I really liked the bras (finally something that fits!) so even if my long line bra does not go with my dress, I will probably keep it anyway because it looks amazing and is totally worth $140. They do a great job, sell expensive stuff that works, and know their stuff about holding up your girls. Just make sure you remember to check your inner ""bridezilla"" at the door and, you know, remember how to read? The return policy is posted on the walls all over the store. Maybe this is in response to the people who have complained below but it was very clear to me. Posted in all the fitting rooms as well. I kind of think a lot of ""brides"" these days think they are a little too important and assume they get what they want. A small shop like Contours isn't going to take your ""maybes"" back all the time or they would go out of business. They want you to leave with something you will love.",positive
"The same thing happened to me that happened to Allie below. It was actually about a year ago, but I was just reminded of it! Since I was so busy with wedding stuff back then, I hadn't had time to write a review. I went here to find a longline bra to wear under my wedding dress. After explaining the situation, we went through their return policy and they explained they'd ""make and exception for me"", since my next fitting was in more than 30 days (like 32 or something). They made a note on the front of my receipt, but never mentioned that it would only be for store credit. In the month between buying it and the fitting, I acutally had left it in my car, in the bag, so I didn't forget it or have any damage to it. It was $140! As a young bride, I didn't have that kind of money to waste! A month later, lo and behold, the bra didn't fit with the dress. When I brought it back to return it though - Sorry! Only store credit. I was shocked. I explained (to the owner) that the saleswoman I had worked with wrote on my receipt I'd be able to return it after my fitting, la la la... but she became defensive immediately. I assume this happens often. She told me the line about how she'll actually be taking a loss on it because they'll have to clean it, to which I explained it actually hadn't been out of the bag, save when I had tried it on earlier that day at the fitting. She said in case I had a cat, they needed to have it laundered. For people with allergies. What?? I said I didn't have a cat, but it didn't seem to matter. The owner then showed me the back of the receipt, noting that for bridal items, there's only in store credit. This is such a ridiculous policy (what the hell makes a bra a bridal bra?), but I would have understood it if I didn't feel they tried to skirt the issue when they sold it. If that is your policy, you need to clearly explain it, not assure someone they can return it, omitting that they'll never see that money again. In the end, she gave me an extra $5 dollars so I could buy two normal bras for that price. Whoopie. I didn't need new bras, I needed money to pay for my wedding. They have nice stuff, don't get me wrong, but their dishonesty really overshadowed all for me.",negative
"I was shopping for a bustier to wear under my wedding dress and found an option at Contours. It was $145 which was way more than I wanted to spend, but I thought it'd be worth it if it worked. I was told, verbatim, that I could ""return within 30 days of my dress fitting"" which was perfect, as my fitting was about an hour after I bought it. The bustier didn't end up working with the dress, so I brought it back 2 hours after I'd purchased it. Only then did they inform me that they only accept returns for store-credit, not a refund. They cited ""cleaning costs"" as a reason, which is ridiculous considering I wore the bustier longer while trying it on in store than I did at the dress fitting. I can understand not accepting underwear, but owning a bustier for 2 hours on a Saturday afternoon does not in any way warrant ""cleaning."" It would have been one thing if they had told me this up front, but that would lose them too many customers. They were very calculated with their verbiage while I was there, never once saying ""we only accept returns for store credit"" in the multiple conversations we had about their policy, and they were just as calculated and rehearsed with their responses when I came back to return it. Their defense was ""the policy is printed on the back of your receipt""... you know, that thing that's given to you *after* you purchase something. I guess my mistake was trusting the words that came out of the sales girls' mouths during the initial visit. I don't dispute the quality of the things they sell or even their return policy, but I'll never be back there thanks to their intentionally deceitful staff.",negative
"I haven't been here in awhile. Unfortunately for me my bra size is so expensive I wear my bras for longer than I should. I know, I know. Shame on me, but I'm a poor college student. This place is the only place I've been able to find my cup size in though! You may scoff, but as a 34HH it's no easy task to find an in person store who carries my size. I almost jumped around in joy when I discovered that! This place gives a great fit. They definitely know what they're doing, unlike the terrible, terrible staff at Victoria's Secret. I have no idea who I worked with, but I know it was one of the owner's. She was a peach! She was just so helpful! She even gave me a few sites I didn't know about where I can find my sized bras. I found it shocking that she was more than happy to hand over other places to find my bras. Maybe she felt my pain in finding the right size. Either way, when I get a chance I'll be back in. Oh, and the prices were pretty competitive with the sites I've had experience with.",positive
"Amazing spot for bras and lingerie! Finally found somewhere with a great selection in my size. The staff is super helpful and knowledgeable, and patient with fittings. They made me feel right at home! Plus the lingerie is all super sexy and cute. HIGHLY recommend stopping by for a fitting- it will change your life!",positive
"I reiterate what several other reviewers state: The bras they fit you with are so doggone tight you won't end up wearing the bras. When you question this, the sales staff is not helpful and tells you that this is the size you are supposed to wear. I mean really, what is the point of having women uncomfortable with their bras? Which is more important: your per-determined belief re: the client's correct size or the comfort of the client? I bought 3 bras and returned one. I should have returned two. The only bra I like is the sport bra. The others are one full size too tight under your chest. I, also, have ""rolls"" from the too-tight bra and I""m not fat. Great concept; poor fitting around the torso. The sales staff needs a complete overhaul at this store. Owner, are you LISTENING???? The other thing I don't like is the only bras they brought to my room are colors I would not normally buy -- bright blue, red&grey, wine, etc.... When you are buying a new bra, you want the most neutral color you can get. How is it that they don't have any neutral colors? Sign me, disgusted and mega-uncomfortable",negative
"Ladies, do yourself a favor and stop by this shop to get you some new lovelies. Contours is one of the few shops in Madison that follow the proper way to do bra fittings (aka the European method of the number being the number in inches of a band tightly just under your boobs and the cup size being the difference in inches from the first measurement and that of you at the fullest part of your boobs when you are leaning over slightly). If you've ever been measured at Victoria's Secret or some other mall store, you are probably wearing the wrong sized bra. If your straps fall down all the time, you're probably wearing the wrong sized bra. If you get the quad boob thanks to the cups cutting into the top of your boobs, you're probably wearing the wrong sized bra. If your band is riding up a ton, you're probably wearing the wrong sized bra. If you have a larger than average sized chest, you're probably wearing the wrong bra. If you're wearing a size small or x-small shirt and you got your bra at Vicky's or a regular store, you're probably wearing the wrong sized bra. The workers at Contours know how to do proper bra fittings (or you can do them yourself with an online guide (www.reddit.com/r/abrathatfits) and bring in your size) and can help you find the styles that work best for you. Bras here are going to be more expensive, but having one that properly fits makes a world of difference. When I went I came home with one new bra and noted several other styles that I liked which I may pick up online. They tend to be cheaper online, but getting to try on several different styles all at once is worth the premium prices you pay here. I didn't have an appointment, but rather just stopped by when out shopping. The sales gal I worked with didn't seem pushy at all and had a very relaxed pace. I wasn't rushed at all. I knew they had a nice selection of bras, but I was pleasantly surprised at the variety and quality of lingerie that they also had on hand. A wide variety of sizes from xsmall to plus sizes is wonderful to see. Fellas, if you want to get some quality undergarments for your ladies, this is the place to go. They even will keep your sizes on file along with a wishlist to make future shopping trips (or present buying) an easier affair.",positive
"Women...you must visit Contours! I've always thought VS was THE place to buy bras until I went to contours. Their professional staff were great...tactfully explaining and showing me how my bras I have now fit WRONG!!! Their classy approach to fittings and explanation of how bras should fit and how to care for them was great. Yes they are a little more than VS per bra (mine was $60), but I really believe they are made better and have a superior fit!",positive
"Amazing. I am very petite and so is my chest. After having 2 kids I really needed help and decided to go to a real bra shop and have someone fit me properly. It was a revelation!

"Big busted ladies of Southern Wisconsin: get thee to Contours! After living in the UK for 3 years, where finding bras for larger sizes is easy peasy (think standard selection in department stores as well a great chain specialty lingerie shop), I was stressed when I came back to Wisconsin. With an upcoming wedding, I was in need of a strapless, longline bra. Nothing crazy. Just standard special occasion underwear. Most gals wear such things under a bridal gown. I spent a week scouring Madison. All the department stores from JCPenney to Boston Store to Macys to Kohls. I checked Victoria's Secret, knowing it would be in vain (as their sizing is hilarious on a good day) and even the lingerie department of Lane Bryant as they stock a broad range of sizes. Very few carried special occasion bras, and none carried larger sizes. I tried David's Bridal. Nope.Then I did some Googling and learned of Contours. While I was away from Madison, some great new things definitely have happened, and Contours is one. Although I did have to wait a while for my personal fitting appointment (as the shop owner was with another client), the sales gal was super kind and offered us (I was shopping with the mother) water and a comfy place to sit. For a small boutique, they have a really great selection of bras and underwear in all shapes, sizes, and colors. And guess where they get most of their stock from? The UK! So, happily, my knowledge of my current bra size in UK terms made for a super easy try-on session. I walked away with a very expensive, but very perfect bra for my big day. Did I pay a little more in Contours than I might've online for the same garment? Yes. Was it worth it for the personal service and knowledge that I was supporting a local, independent business? ABSOLUTELY. I plan on going back here for other undie needs and will be sending anyone I know who mentions their need of big-busted bras! (Though they stock a range, they seem to specialize in carrying larger sizes not available elsewhere). Contours: I love it.",positive
"Contours Lingerie is simply amazing! I wear a very unique and difficult size and can't ever find something comfortable and cute in mass stores. Contours is very attentive during your personal fitting as well as professional and honest. I've never had so many bras that fit to chose from, but also didn't feel pressured to overspend. Absolutely worth a trip! Give yourself 1-1.5 hours to really enjoy the experience.",positive
"Best bra shopping experience ever. But then again, I just had my breast augmentation 6 weeks ago. Thought I was going to be 38C, little shock horror I was actually 36E.

You do not get this service/selection at the mall or large department store. Tia you rock bring this service to Madison - THANK YOU!!!",positive
"I trust my giant knockers to Contours Lingerie. AMAZING, personalized and friendly service, and a great selection of bras that actually fit my F cup jugs.

"I've been wearing chucks since.... well since they weren't cool and a statement of youth and thumb in the eye of society. A long time. And I've been buying them at this Converse store since the mall opened The workers have always been nice, pleasant, let you shop and are available if you have a question or need them to check in the back for a particular size. The store itself is always well organized and even on the discount wall you don't have to search the size 4 shoe area while you're looking for size 11. I've been to several Converse outlet stores but this one is always better than the rest. Though they didn't have what I was looking for today, I'll be back for some new chucks, soon. Oh and def hit the discount wall. I've picked up Varvatos chucks at steep steep discounted prices.",positive

We usually stop by once in awhile when we are in the area to browse the stores to see what is new. Today we stopped in and hit the Mother Load of a deal at The Converse store where we picked up two pairs of All Stars (his and hers). Buy one get one 50 % off so mine only cost $15 bucks! We snagged two pair of shoes and two additional sets of laces for $52 total which is less than 1 pair at full price! We will be back for sure as the selection is great and the staff is friendly. I like that the store is clean and organized as well. My baby boy and I will be back for sure to shop for a great deal! I have a dirty mind.,positive
Excellent selection of character Chucks. They always have really good sells on their shoes. This is my go to place for a new pair of kicks. They pretty much cover all of the sizes from infant through adult (size 14's). I don't think I have ever walked out of here without a pair of shoes.,positive
"Love coming to costco! Especially if your a big family they have great size amounts of food. Love getting water bottles from here for $3 for like 42 bottles. They have great deals on snacks sometimes. Also they have ice creams, meats, milk, eggs, & croissants for a great price. They have samples thru the store as well. After shopping we love going to their food court!",positive
"Costco is Costco I feel, but customer service is still customer service and thats what they dont seem to have when issues pop up. To start I added my mom onto my account. Who would have known that adding someone was such a fuss? They gave my mom a piece of paper and said it was her temporary membership because the photo machine wasnt working. The same day when she checked out they wouldnt even honor the piece of paper because it was only good for today and apparently that means it was already expired? The supervisor had to come and look at it and it was a mess. Cutting it short we got through the checkout line. My mom wanted a churro. Bailey who took our 1 churro order was friendly. Until we waited over an hour for a churro. I kept asking her what the deal was and she just kept saying ""Well they are done they just need to be handed out"". It takes an hour to hand out a churro thats already done? Everyone else recieved their hot dog, pizza or ice cream way before I even recieved a churro and I was before them? We went back up to customer service area where my mom was supposed to recieve her card. Diane was nice but she really didnt know how to work anything and seemed to struggle since the time me and my mom arrived, got groceries a churro and still didnt have my moms membership ID ready. Total of 4 hours. Walking out at the door we advised Tracy of our poor service. She seemed to not even care. Not even willing to get a manager or anything. Her reply to our concerns were just ""Oh really? Aw Im sorry that cant be here at OUR Costco"". Well it was at your Costco Tracy. And nobody seemed to want to get a manager when asked, instead avioded it. Never will I come to this specific Costco.",negative
"Costco has always been a great place to shop. However, the above and beyond customer service I received yesterday just took it to a new level. With a 20 day old newborn I made the mistake of forgetting to pull the feeding bottle out of the cooler pocket early, so it could come to room temp in time for feeding. With a fussy baby ready to eat I went to the restroom to run the bottle under the faucet in the hopes of expediting the warming process. I didn't even make it to the faucet before a very observant employee stopped me and said ""that water won't be hot enough for your needs, follow me."" Without hesitation he took me to the employee break room and heating me up a cup of water. During this process he told me how he had 5 kids and had heated plenty of bottles in his day. I was overwhelmed with gratitude and awestruck with the above and beyond service this staff member offered. My only regret is not getting ""his"" name in the mix of it all. Costco: if your wanted to further look into who it might have been this is what I know. He had 5 kids, about 5:10 (I think), and it happened at about 12:45 on 5-9-18. Thank you",positive
Costco is the BEST! They have such amazing items and almost all of them are great quality. If I do happen to not like something tough I really enjoy their great return policy. I have found they are starting to have so many non GMO and organic products. The only problem about Costco is sometimes I get hooked on a product that they eventually discontinue.,positive
"Our favorite cCostco! Always stocks regular necessities as well as new, enjoyable products. The staff is friendly and helpful. The store is always kept clean and they have goodies to sample. Love their prices and the gas station.",positive
"This is my favorite Costco near me. Usually clean and organized quite well. I wish they did more sales like I saw in Utah. The staff here are friendly and I do enjoy the samples. I especially like to tell each demo person ""Thank you"", as I'm sure they don't hear it enough. It's hard sometimes to walk away from their sales pitching. The food service up front is really fast and the taste is good. I'd say my most favorite part of Costco is the very meat packed rotisserie chicken. Grocery stores can't come close to Costco. Keep up the great work guys!!",positive
"Lots of lines open and very helpful staff, quick in and out at this location. The gas station also moves at a decent pace. Definitely recommend this location",positive
"Costco, especially this one, is having difficulty handling their check out queues. In addition, I recently had a broken foot in a boot...and they only had the electric carts available on about 2 of 6 visits. Getting less and less impressed with their pricing other than gasoline; and, their CEO's tendency to censor conservative books is a real negative.",negative
"I love Costco. Everyone is friendly, great prices, fast lines. Also, if you want to return something, they will accept it, and give you a refund, no questions asked. Great place",positive
"I am very appalled at the lack of service or even compassion I was treated with today! Our family moved to Arizona 5 months ago and have shopped for groceries no where but this costco location which is further from my home. Being raised in Hawaii if you decide that a business is good to its customers you support that store by being loyal. We have spend hundreds even thousands since we've been here and just bought a brand new flat screen last weekend. Today my family and I tried to shop there like usually, this time we had brought my 8 yr olds new puppy who weighs 2 lbs and just got shots. So according to Vet I can't leave her alone for 24-48 hrs incase a reaction occurs. I never would normally bring a pet to a store, but Sunday's are the only days my husband is off to shop. I had total confidence this would not be a problem since I ALWAYS see dogs in the store whom are definately NOT service dogs. I had puppy in large plastic tub so she would not touch cart or anything in store. I was stopped at door and asked if she was a service dog... I explained that no puppy at eight weeks so it could be considered a service dog because they are just too new. I explain the whole situation with the shots and then I would normally not bring her but didn't have a choice. I was told by the manager who had a tattoo on his left arm that I was not allowed in the store with the puppy. I was extremely shocked! Meanwhile my husband is holding my two-year-old who is crying since we have been waiting at the door for 10 minutes for a manager to show up. I explained to him that she is in a Tupperware and would not touch anything she would not be allowed out and we just need to grab some groceries and we shop here weekly. I was told because I did not say she was a service dog she could not come in. I explained to him that I see other animals in the store all the time we're definitely not service dogs and they are walking around on the ground contaminating the store... Where is the puppy would be close off in a container and not touch anything. He did not care. I was even told that if I had said that she was a service dog and lied she would have been let in the store. This was shocking to me that my honesty would cause me to receive worst service from a manager! I even explained to the manager that I was so appalled I was even thinking of returning the TV and just canceling my entire membership with Costco! He did not say he was concerned at any time, did not say he thought it was unfortunate, He showed no remorse at all! My family now had to drive 40 minutes to and from that Costco with no groceries, and a screaming baby, and are now sitting outside of Winco seriously contemplating how A business could be run with such horrible and uncompassionate management! I have shopped at many Cosco's and this was an absolute disgrace to Costco's name! my 8yr old went from being excited about her new puppy to mortified. Since costco and management did not show any appreciation or care that we were thinking of cancelling our costco account - we took our business to Winco for the first time! The service was great! Management came over to check on us since we had the puppy, they also have policy for no pets besides service dogs BUT he was able to see puppy would not contaminate or bother anyone, puppy was tiny and shouldn't be left alone, and appreciated having us as customers and welcomed us! I didn't have to buy a HUGE quantity of anything to get the wholesale price, so thanks costco to pointing us to another business. Instead of dropping $400-$600 at costco we only had to spend $250 for all the same things. https://youtu.be/8im62ouVeZM video taken at costco to show we were stopped at door like criminals",negative
The gas prices are always the lowest and the price for food is reasonable. The return policy for electronics is the best when it comes to retail.,positive
"Hot dog and pop, $1.59+ tax. Fabulous deal!!! Had a living social deal. Got a $20 gift card with membership, and coupons. I like the meal area best. Co-worker goes there weekly.",positive
"Dr Bush is just fantastic! We drove 2.5 hours from N AZ only to find out that the front desk person Jenna lost our appointment. When she was the one who took it! She was extremely frustrating and the conversation was going nowhere when Dr Bush came out and took us anyway. Even then Jenna was attempting to push on the power button and make me to find the number I called when I made an appointment. (The phone records go back only two weeks). Dr Bush had been taking care of us for a really long time and I do understand how difficult it is to find a rally good front desk person, therefore I guess the search continues ;-)",positive
Costco always seems to please. We enjoy visiting them all around the country. This particular location is larger than some with a large variety of food options. They have specialty alcohol for purchase in a viewing case with prices up to $1500. They also have large gun safes and smaller quick release safes for handguns great for under the desk or attached to a night stand. The location is always busy but well kept. The people are great and they really make you feel welcome!,positive
"Always excellence in service and this time I visited the auto center to have my air in my tires checked. Auto technician Cameron notified me of my front passenger tire did not look right and he highly encouraged me to take some time to have them assess it and have it fixed if needed and was concerned if I continue to ride on it, I could have a potential massive blowout. I had some time on my hands and decided to have it checked out. I am very fortunate that I had the time to spare because it was confirmed that same tire was pulling apart badly and it could have been very bad news if I continued to ride on it. I had no idea! They were able to change my tire for a new one and rotate my wheels in a very timely manner. I was impressed! I am a huge fan of Costco and it's employees. THANK YOU Cameron for your proactive actions in saving me from what could have been a horrible experience. My new tire was in total $149.20 for the Turanza Serentiy Plus Performance with a 75,000 mile warranty, tire instal and tire rotation. I made out on this price deal and it was confirmed by an auto specialist that informed his company could not touch that deal whatsoever. SWEET! I LOVE COSTCO! :)",positive
"Went here because I was in the neighborhood and wanted to get a few ink cartridges refilled. Customer service here is really subpar. Girl behind the photo counter refused to even acknowledge me until I actually called for her outloud, even though she had looked up from her cell phone twice. I really wish Costco would prevent employees from using their cell phones while on duty and in plain sight of customers. It is very unprofessional. Go to the back, use it on break but not in front of customers.",negative
"Tracy was her name. I went to this location to get hot Pizza and a hot dog. She stopped me at the front, asked for my costco card. I said my grandma and I share it, 80% of the time she uses it. They way she asked was not polite at all! There was no ""excuse me sir"" or even just ""sir"" she yelled at me, ""do you have your card!? I explained myself the situation. I also told her to look our account up, and that will match our address and last name. She straight up said ""NO"" you need to have a card in order to come inside here. She kept directing us back outside. If she had a sensible brain, she wouldn't have made it a big deal in front of everyone. She should've asked me to step to the Side and explain me what ever she had to say calmly, and most importantly with a polite character. All in all, I just felt horrible, and sad for that lady. She maybe just having a bad day, but her bad day cost that Coscto a customer. And other future costco potential customers. I always talked up Coscto (because of the pricing quality of stuff and service), since I have had a couple of incidences which I let slide, this one by far was the worst customer service I have received! I will talk people out from joining Coscto, and also to make it well known about this incident, I made sure all my friends and their friends shared this on facebook. Hopefully she was not racist! That would be horrible for Coscto. Next time watch your mouth Tracy! Have a wonderful day",negative
"In regards to the EBT at check out on 2/19/2016 between 8pm & 845pm. Apparently the EBT system was down or you guys were having some issues. Next time please have a sign at main entrance. It was extremely embarrassing and stressful having to make a decision between paying for the food we need and paying my electric bill. Only because my 8 year old was with me and I had no choice but pay with money I didn't have and now I will be late paying my electric bill. It was either that or having to explain to my child that I can't pay for our food! The cashier just kept apologizing nice and loud and clear for the whole world to hear. And the man who she had called over to verify if the system was down, he didn't even acknowledge me, he kept eye contact with the cashier and just told her ""yes, it's still down"" and walked away.... really? Just so everyone is clear. Having an EBT card is not a choice of the matter...it's a necessity so I can feed my daughter and myself. I don't need to explain my life issues and how I went about receiving an EBT card and I am not ashamed to use one since I don't have a choice at the moment...but let me tell you, I've never been so embarrassed. So much so that I will not be back at this property ...only to get gas. This location is near my house, visit here frequently for years. And my last post on 2/1/2015 was 4 stars. Would have been 5 but the eye exam receptionist was rude and tacky. But I enjoy shopping at all Costco's and they vary in service pending on which property/neighborhood it's in. And lately service here is sterile. Cashiers are usually the only ones with a smile on their face. Sad, cause I would be beyond grateful to have any job and I would have empathy and understanding with customers. I'm sorry maybe I wrote this review too soon and it's not easy for me to address this but I can't imagine what it would have felt like if I really had no money at all, to leave all that food there and walk out empty handed having my 8 year old ask me why. And now I just hope I can somehow magically come up with enough $ to pay my electric bill on time!",negative
"Great Costco location. As a Tucson native with a million siblings (not an exaggeration or anything), I spent many weekends trolling the aisles at the Grant location down there, searching for my mother (you know, the ush). So obviously I'm pretty much a Costco expert, and as such, I can tell you that this location is FAR from the busiest location in the Valley and FAR from the least quality location. Is this location busy? Umm duh. It's Costco. The only location I have ever been to that wasn't busy was the Cave Creek/101 location and let me be real with you guys--that location was so empty that it resembled that movie Zombieland. I don't know about you but I'm not really feelin' Zombieland when I'm buying tomato sauce in bulk, but hey if that's your jam, head on over there. So anyway, like I was saying, sure this Costco is busy, but it's only cuckoo bananas during the holidays. I'm going to go ahead and take a wild guess that all of them are like that though, so hey, it's all good in the Yorkshire hood. I've never had any issues with the quality of the produce or meat here. Great layout of da goods, and the sample ladies and gents are pretty rad. Also, the parking lot is way better than some of the locations in the east valley for sure. The only downside of this location is the occasional slow-walker killing my fast-walking vibe. That being said, this location has a wider selection of products in comparison to the Zombieland one so...I guess we will all just have to deal with the slow walkers. That's life though, right?",positive
"The only beef I have about Costco is this; PLEASE add a little fitting room!! I wanted to buy a swimsuit and all women know you have to try 20 on to find one that fits decent. When I asked if I could try it on in the restroom, I was told I had to BUY it first.. Does this make sense? So now I have a ""too small"" swimsuit that I need to drive all the way back to return..ugh..",positive
"we always get gas from here.. Love the coffee too ;) one thing I hate is that when I go there with my husband and forget my wallet, he has to pay but the Costco card is on my name, so they won't allow him to pay because he's not a member!!?weird! We have the same last name, they should allow it if I'm there with him! It's frustrating.",positive
"I come here for a lot of shopping from groceries to books, to household items, even gas. I love Costco and my family does too! You buy things in bulk and they are cheaper because they are in bulk. And I love that they don't use plastic bags for your groceries and instead they recycle the boxes they used from when the shipments came, so I find that to be Earth friendly and cool. They have on site food, frozen yogurt, and drinks with a place to eat. The kids love it and I'm such sucker for their frozen yogurt berry sundae. It's so cheap and so delicious and so is their pizza!!!! The only reason I didn't give this place 5 stars is because every time I go the lines are always insanely long. Doesn't really seem to matter what time of day you go, they are busy and have long lines that stretch into the aisle which is great for them because it means their business is booming. But it would be nice if they had a couple of cashiers that could run to help with check out service to get the line crushed down. And I'm giving it 4 stars and not 5 also because they seem to pick and choose when they want to card you at the door, it's really weird. I can watch some people walk in ahead of me and not flash their cards at all and I'll be right behind them and I get chased down to check to see if I'm a member. It's annoying but it's not going to stop me from going there for their yummy food and amazing discounted prices. I'm a fan, yay!",positive
Costco has many redeeming qualities. Not all but just a few of these redeeming qualities are great big savings on..... Car Tires Dry Goods Some Produce Sometimes Fresh Fish Healthy Natural Dog Chews Called Nubz ( A Costco Exclusive ) Offered Occasionally Big Bottles Of Booze cheap They also do food demos that some people call lunch. This store SOMETIMES has problems with too much moldy produce (see photos) and too many loose carts in the parking lot. (see photos) They also occasionally let people in with their pets. (see photos) I somewhat forgive them for most of their faults but need to drop them a star for MESSING WITH MY CHICKEN. I liked the packaged chicken they used to sell but they replaced that better chicken with Foster Farms Chicken. I don't think Foster Farms is bad chicken but it's just OK chicken that I could buy at Fry's. (If I wanted to.) The breast and thighs are much smaller and lighter color meat with less flavor than the other chicken they used to sell for the same price. Meh. I've just experienced better Chicken someplace else.,negative
"A week ago, while I was on my way to work, the ""low fuel"" light on my car turned on. So, I decided to go to Costco to fill up. Got there, filled up, hopped back in my car, and it wouldn't start. It was dead. D.E.A.D. dead. :( The attendant was awesome. He quickly ran over and helped me push by behemoth of an SUV out of the way, so as not to block the pumps. He even asked if I needed to call someone for help. I really admire the caliber of employees Costco hires. The reason I only give 4 stars is that the location is terrible. It's in an awkward location, which prevents easy access.",positive
"One of the rare 5-star reviews I'll give because it just doesn't get any better than this. Forget Disneyland, THIS is my Happiest Place on Earth! I have a (pathetic) habit of visiting Costcos in every city I visit to see what regional goodies they offer. This is my 'home' Costco. It's a little like Cheers - I know most/all of the employees by name and/or sight, and I'm such a Costco fixture that many of them know me. And the team here is a helpful one. I know the layout of the store and can easily spot new items as they arrive. In short, this store is like a comfortable old shoe...that also sells bargain-basement gas! ;-) If I could find one complaint, it's that meat prices have recently risen a lot, but it's still a bargain relative to most meat markets.",positive

Seriously Costco, Home of the How in the hell did we spend $300 on toilet paper, pumpkin pie and Captain Morgan? Costco, Home of the... what They are out... I knew we should have bought that earlier. Damn.",positive
"O Beloved Costco! Numerous are the reasons for which you deserve praise. A cavernous structure, awesome to behold, to accommodate A bewildering array of merchandise, easy on the pocket. Fresh produce, baked goods, meats, frozen items Packaged for assemblages rather than for individuals. Tools, small appliances and other electronics To delight even the most jaded gadget enthusiast. Gasoline, optometry, insurance, home loans, And the lowest markup on generic pharmaceuticals. Patient ladies and gentlemen handing out food samples, Tolerating my shameless repeat visits to their stations. Refusing to stock a product like that Cola from Atlanta When its manufacturers would not lower its wholesale price. Clothing, home decor, books, music, the list goes on And still I am delighted to see new items with each visit. Beloved Costco, progeny of Kirkland, long may you stay A shining beacon in the world of wholesale!",positive
"My favorite Costco location in the West valley because it doesn't attract as many snowbirds & slow elderly patrons. The aisles don't get as packed and the lines aren't as long as the Arrowhead location. Parking isn't bad either, and they have pretty much the same selection as the other locations in the valley. Only downside is that it is a somewhat sketchy area and you may not want to take a nice car to this parking lot. On the other hand, for snowbirds this area is somewhat confusing with the on/off ramps for both I-17 and the 101, so this keeps them away.",positive
"Don't be ashamed, Deb. Costco is the shizz nizzle dizzle if I can be so-ten-years-ago. And there's always a free mini lunch (via samples) when you visit and they do carry many superior products at prices not found lower elsewhere. Though sometimes their prices are higher than grocery stores on some stuff, do your research and don't fall victim to the impulse buy no matter how agonizingly difficult it is!!!!!!!!!!!!!!LJH)*HFOH Okay, soooo-you can get discount FOX group restaurant cards, prime ribeyes for 8.99/lb (though rare) and the most killer La Brea Artisan bread, not to mention cheeses and Steelhead trout which is the bomb and laundry soap and...okay, I guess you get the point. Costco ROCKS.",positive
"Costco provides a much needed service in the valley ...It's kind of like your favorite shady uncle who you know can always help you out. It's not that you really want to spend that much time with your uncle but he always knows a few short cuts to help you out . You get a nail in your tire uncle Costco can help you out, you need a birthday cake that tastes good and less expensive,uncle Costco has a guy in the back that can help . You are having a party and you need super tasty frozen stuff bada bing bada boo, uncle Costco has the stuff. Now you know uncle Costco can get you the goods but you don't really want to know how he got Strawberries in October, or Salmon in the desert or even why Uncle Costco takes everything back so easily.He even got me a huge bag of blackberries from some guys he knows in Chile . And the kids always like him because every time you go see him you can get tasty cheapo pizza and frosty yogurts. I am not sure how I came to be acquainted with Uncle Costco, Mom says she has known him forever and part of me knows I need to strengthen my boundaries with him . How long can I turn my eyes from his gas guzzling shenanigans, I guess as long as he can get me me bags of avocados for a song!",positive
"My experience here was remarkable. When I arrived I felt nothing but positive energy. It was the highlight of my Vegas trip. I got to see Ryan outside but didn't bother him. I could tell he was very focused on his work and I respect him for that. The cars and Mike's bus are so perfect it is almost unbelievable. The bus is very cool in person. TV doesn't really capture it. The quality and detail work on everything was exceptional. I loved getting to see the exact cars I saw being built on my screen. The best part by far were the people. They don't even charge for admission! They appreciate their fans in a very genuine way. Every one of them invited me to hang out at Danny's place for their weekly meet and greet. If I wasn't flying out tonight I would be there right now. You know immediately that this respect and appreciation for each other and you comes from the top. I have met Danny yet but I know by his work family's treatment of everyone around them that he must be an exceptional leader. I bought the t-shirt and kept the receipt as a souvenir to prove I got there, at the shop. I wish everybody there years of health, wealth and happiness. I was genuinely impressed and inspired.",positive

If you really have to get work done on your ride and you have an extra $50,000.00 to throw away stop in and get fucked by the Count.",negative
Loved this. I don't watch the show but I enjoy it when I do catch it. The bikes and cars are amazing. The place is on the dark side which is expected but that makes it hard to take some photos.,positive

"If you're a fan of the show, and are visiting Las Vegas, this is a must stop! You will probably see some the people on the show, we saw Rollie, and they had Horney Mikes bus parked outside. We also saw Shane directing traffic to the shop, and plenty of cool vehicles inside the shop! Would most certainly recommend checking this place out!",positive
This place is well worth the visit. My wife even enjoyed the visit. Like others said you won't see the work going on or the stars but seeing their work in person is a must. They do top notch work imho. It is more or less a tourist destination to promote the show. But that was cool by me. If you love the show. I highly recommend a visit.,positive
"The location this place is at is totally not what I expected. It's not glorious or amazing, its a small place in the back of a business complex shared by other businesses. This actually adds to the coolness of this place. The fact that they can make these old cars beautiful and new out of a small place like this is incredible. They offer free tours of Danny's warehouse where he keeps his personal collection, and the cars are beautiful. We were informed when we walked in that Danny had just left which was a bummer, but he's incredibly busy so I didn't expect to see him. Expect to go though this place in about 10-15 minutes. It's a small place, but its totally worth checking out.",positive
"My hubby is a huge fan of the show, this is our 2nd time visiting. Free tour of the showroom, awesome atmosphere. Very cool to look at all the cars in the showroom, you can take as much time as you want and all the pictures you want. At the end the have a gift shop area, t-shirts run about $25.00. My hubby got to meet and take a pic with Rolli. Definitely recommend stopping by, parking attendants are very helpful!",positive
If you get tired of gambling and your a car buff this is a must see. We took a ride to get my brother a shirt. quite a showroom. Nice group of people working there and a nice assortment of merchandise. Quite a guys place.,positive
Counts Kustoms was my favorite thing to do while in Vegas. The staff and the customer service we received was amazing. The talent that these guys have is truly mind blowing. I can't believe that the count has decided to make this a free attraction. He truly cares about people and for the love of vintage cars. It is a must see while in Vegas!,positive

Cool shop. A big fan of the show and to see some the cars from the show was cool. Loved the Buick Rivera. To see it in person was incredible. I got my favorite souvenir from there. A counts kustom coffee mug. Lol. It was not crowded so hot right in. No cost. Would recommend.,positive
"Highlight of my trip. The collection of cars is awsome, you can tell the love that Danny has for his cars and buisness as soon as you walk in. Every single bike and car in his collection is beautiful, I wish he was there to ask for a picture but we all know he's a busy guy. I recommend anyone who loves the show or just cars to stop and check it out !!!!!",positive
"My dad wanted to go see Danny's collection while we were in town, I'm glad we came. Not a bad way to kill an hour in Vegas without spending any money (unless you have to pay for a cab). No line or crowd, parking was easy. Cars and bikes were cool, staff was friendly. We saw Danny pulling out of the parking lot in some pimp looking car (Stutz, I think) as we walked in, and we saw horny Mike dragging some parts out of his bus. We didn't approach him, he looked busy, like he was actually working. Less of a tourist trap than the pawn shop.",positive
"If you are fan and if you appreciate nice cars, this is a good stop for you. For me, i enjoy the show but not a fan of fancy cars in general so it was ok. My bf appreciated and oohed and aahed over the cars. We spent a lot of money on souvenir shirts and caps. KK was the most expensive of the 3 History Channel store shows. Coolest designs though.",negative
"Staff was extremely friendly and polite. They were a great reflection of how genuine Danny appears to be on the show. I accidently drooled on the floor by the '67 GTO, sorry Danny! This is a great visit if you are in LV. When in Vegas, visit Counts Kustoms!!",positive
"My husband and I love this show and we decided to stop by the shop. It was a great time. All of the staff was very friendly, from the kid telling us where to park to the nice girl selling me my Count's Kustoms Cap. The collection was amazing. Seeing the coffin couch was fun. I might have to have Danny build me one someday. :) It was a great experience. We didn't get to see any of the guys but that's ok. Maybe next year we will get lucky. :)",positive
Visiting Counts Kustoms is very much worth the trip! To see their work done on TV is great but to see the cars on person is Phenomenal! I wish to one day get a car done by Danny & the boys,positive
"Went during the week. Easy to find, plenty of parking and help with that as there were attendants directing traffic once you pulled into the complex and turned around the building towards Danny's main entrance to his museum and store. Once inside there were ample people helping with the directing of foot traffic. Sign in and walk through the big doors into his store and museum. You have to leave any drinks (sodas, beer, etc.) on top of the refrigerator that is just inside and to the right of the big door. BTW that fridge is custom painted. The guys in the paint shop must have been bored with nothing to do one day! Absolutely gorgeous rides, bikes and other creations. Some of which have been featured on the show like the bicycle Horny Mike built and lost the bet to Scott with and had to ride on the street dressed in a thong. After being painted green! :D A tour bus pulled in, about 30 minutes after my friend and I got there, and a couple dozen tourists walked inside. Horny Mike and Roli came out and did the meet and greet thing, took snapshots with people and answered questions. Bought some swag (coffee mug and a Dickies CKs embroidered work shirt), talked with the celebs a bit and left. It was a fun experience. Highly recommended. If the work on the vehicles in the museum is any representation of the kind of work his guys do then I would absolutely recommend having your classic car, truck or bike worked on by them. I wish I had the cash to spruce up my '93 Heritage Softail. I would have them work on it in a NY minute!",positive
"I am a sucker for reality TV. Counting cars is another one of those easy watching shows, my husband likes the cars, I like that the guys are so easy going and just plain nice, you don't see that much now a days anymore. A lot of guys from the show were there, I had no idea this place had a following like Pawn Stars. (though they don't have a line around the building or charge entrance) Easy parking, sign in, and walk right in to see Danny's private collection as well as some other fun stuff. They have an overpriced gift shop, but who doesn't. My husband loved their Dickie's jackets, but $145 is steep. That aside, everyone was super nice, the vibe cool, the cars amazing and my guys got a nice break from the girly stuff they had to put up with the day before, win win.",positive
Get a GPS or take a taxi because it's hard to find. Once you get there it's hard to park in the right spot. We had to move. They are in a boxed in area with limited parking. Other businesses rent there too and I'm sure they hate the fans taking all their parking. An employee keeps telling people to move their cars. The first thing we saw was Horny Mike's bus outside. When you get close the paint is amazing. It glitters in the sun. You walk in the shop and right away you are at the counter where they filmed many times. Beyond you find Danny's collection of cars. There are enough cars that you must adore at least one of them. You can buy trinkets and such if you like. They don't take you in the working shop areas but the tour is self guided and free. I loved being in the shop. I think you would love it too if you've seen the show.,positive
Stopped at Count's Kustom's today. We had the pleasure of meeting Danny and taking photos with him. He is very nice!! He hasn't let stardom go to his head!!!,positive
Took my wife and two boys to check out the shop. Friendly staff but unfortunately after about 25 minutes they notified us that they would be closing for filming. Nice choppers and cars in the collection for viewing. No charge to enter. Roli stepped-in for a second and was nice enough to take a picture with my boys. Will come back when i'm in LV again to spend time in the gift shop. Thanks Count's Kustom!,positive
"THis shop is a freakin joke!, Scott is a idiot and i will never use this shop nor allow anyone i know to use it. Have to make an appointment to event talk to anyone about a project, and it takes 30 minutes to get that much help out of the staff there",negative
"Came all the way to the mall just to go to Dicks. Yelp, there website. Everything says. Open till 7PM. It's 615. And... the entire thing is closed. This isn't okay. I will be taking my business to amazon.",negative
"This store has not much of a selection in licensed merchandise. No NHL, very little NFL . We are a week from the World Cup and they only have 2 teams. Unless you need the basics then don't waste your time here.",negative
Have to give a kudos to Aaron in the athletic shoes department. He is as very helpful and patient. Great service hasn't always been our experience at Dick's so this was a pleasant surprise!,positive
This particular location of Dick's is the best place for CO2 refills. I come here very frequently and they have the process down well so it goes smoothly and efficiently. Thanks guys!,positive
"Complete disgrace. Customer service is a joke and they should be embarrassed. I waited 30 minutes for help in a section and ZERO employees showed up. I and three or four other customers were left to wander, ignored. I called out to employees from other sections for help and they literally ignored me and walked the other way. I came here ready to spend money. Now I am leaving and will never return.",negative
"Not sure why I keep on coming into Dick's Sporting Goods, as I hardly ever buy anything, but I guess it's the fantasy of someday being about to do more outdoor activities when IF it ever cools down! This location is attached to the Scottsdale Fashion Square mall on the lower level under the Harkin's theater. It's a typical Dicks's with all the normal stuff you'd find in a sporting goods store. They have all the sport clothing, shoes and accessories, camping supplies, golfing, canoeing, biking stuff and so much more. If you're an outdoorsy kind of person, one could spend a lot of time in here ""shopping"" for all the activities you enjoy. One thing I noticed about this location along with all other locations here in Arizona, the staff never ask me if I need any help. They don't ever seem that busy to be honest, just standing around in their areas doing whatever. I'm sure there are times, like on the weekends when this place gets busy and the staff are actually working, I just never see it. Prices I suppose are average for a Sporting place, but I have found the exact item online for several dollars cheaper even with shipping. So unless I need something right away, I probably won't do much shopping in the actual store.",negative
"These people are untrained or not smart. They leave the sensor on the merchandise, and then when you are 30 minutes away and call them to complain, the best suggestion they can offer is for you to turn around and ACTUALLY COME BACK to their extremely inconvenient locations to have the sensor taken off! Who does this? What is the point of putting a sensor on your merchandise if your employees don't take it off, but also if it doesn't even make the alarms go off?! Furthermore, why are you putting useless sensors on ""protective"" football pants, which, if worn with the sensor that you don't remove, could actually cause an injury?! Here's an idea, Dick's, why don't you train your employees to take the sensors off the merchandise at the time of purchase so that customers don't have to be inconvenienced by driving to your store twice in one day, OR provide your customers with a device to take the sensor off themselves, since your employees don't, and it serves no purpose anyway. Another idea would be to fix your equipment so that the sensor actually causes an audible alarm which would signal your employees and customers that a sensor needs to still be removed from the merchandise. I've got 8 kids who play sports, but I'll be avoiding Dick's and ordering online from now on, I don't have the time-luxury to drive across town four times in one day for no reason.",negative
"OMG what a terrible experience at Dick's Sporting Goods at Scottsdale Fashion Square Mall last Saturday, 7/30/16! ""Bo"" in the bicycle department was rude, tried to intimidate me by speaking loudly and over me, and finally just flat out said he didn't have time to look up my warranty info when he found out I bought my bike at Tempe's Dick's Sporting Goods!!! Rather than telling this rude, young man off, I grabbed my bicycle and took it to Tempe. His manager was apologetic and appeared surprised when I told him about my experience and the fact that Bo told me he didn't have time to find my warranty info. Btw, once I started walking away with my bike, Bo was yelling out...""I'll fix it for free""! Really? Because my warranty plan dictates my tuneup and first flat tire service IS free! The only way I would be happy with Dick's at Scottsdale Fashion Square Mall is by never having to see or deal with Bo ever again!!!!",negative
"My daughter and I went in to the store to look at men's shorts for working out. Right off the bat two sales people greeted us one right after the other and we told each of them what we were looking for and both of them said ok great and did not direct us where to look or anything. A third employee approached us a few minutes later and was very helpful, even directing us to a clearance rack for Nike shorts. Overall,it was not a positive experience and I don't think we will return. We bought one pair there and then we went on Amazon prime where we bought several more for two day delivery. The only reason we even bought the one pair there is we wanted him to have something tomorrow because all he had were cargo shorts",negative
"I walked into your store and couldn't find what I was looking for. I couldn't find help. I said hello how are you to a man (seemed like a manager) and he said ok. I indeed and said just okay and I got a dirty look and was told yes okay. I wanted ski clothing. Gloves, hat, boots. I couldn't find any and left. I went to REI and got great service. Thank you for wasting my time Dick. I don't think I will return.",negative
Staff is always friendly and available for help or questions. I also like that each person has their own department they work in. So you're not asking for help in archery from someone who has never held a compound bow.,positive
"Your typical Dick's Sporting Goods, just at a great location. Staff was pleasant and merchandise was well stocked. The store was very clean (errrr, it's new!)...even the bathroom. It'll do well!",positive
"I have been a shopper at Dick's Sporting Goods for years, and often have enjoyed perusing their aisles. Unfortunately, during my last visit to their store, with my cart there in my hand, I was notified by their staff of their new anti-constitutional fundamental freedom position assumed by their corporate owners. Apparently, Dick's has determined to support violating the fundamental civil rights of young Americans by illegally (in violation of the civil rights act) discriminating against members of the public ages 17-20 by prohibiting them from exercising their 2nd amendment rights and by hiring lobbyists to urge congress to violate the constitutional rights of their consumers. I cannot and will not in good conscience shop at a store like Dick's where people who also put on the uniform are discriminated against. If a store wants to get involved in politics--that's great, but it shouldn't be acting like Woolworths lunch counters barring African Americans during the civil rights struggle. Dick's has lost me, despite a good selection of kayaks.",negative
"How does this place survive? It's giant but usually has more employees than customers, and I can see why. They are way overpriced, and the camping and hiking stuff is mostly low quality crap that you can buy much cheaper elsewhere.",negative
"Came here with a friend to go over new golf clubs. Used them in the test area upstairs, this guy devin was being quite the D.. irritated with his arrogant behavior I put my nike's back and my friend decided to get his new clubs elsewhere.",negative
"Dick's is great! You can always find cute workout gear, shoes, golf stuff and random sports equipment like Frisbee golf! I like that you can check their stock online so you don't make a useless trip and they have a little bit of everything",positive
"Dicks sporting good has a great overall selection for all sports whether it's basketball football baseball hiking canoeing whatever it is you name it they will have some type of physical inventory for you to look at. You can shop online to find great deals and sign up for the newsletters but if you're someone like me who physically likes to touch and feel some of the items then come in the store. The staff is pretty knowledgeable and there are two floors with the downstairs consisting of mostly football, baseball, & biking. Head upstairs and you will find more of the outdoor camping equipment. Most of the clothing here is a little pricey but again leverage the coupons online browsing and always check to see if the items you're looking for or available in stores to save you a trip.",positive
"I have been shopping at Dicks Sporting Goods for quite some time now. They always have some fresh Nike and Under Armor gear. The staff is always friendly and they have changing rooms with mirrors so you can try on the clothes. I've been a collector of sports gear and they also have some great suns, ASU, dbacks, cardinals gear too. Plus I grew up playing basketball so they have great basketballs. I go to the gym a lot too and they have awesome gear for the gym. (Hand wraps and gloves) Dick's have been good to me with their online program that you use your phone number with. I'm HUGE into Nike and buy my Nike gear if I can't find what I'm looking for at the Nike stores. Plus when it's the Olympics they always have really cool Olympics apparel",positive
The manager of this store is racist his name is yorby Yost I was profiled coming into the store with my 17 year old son I don't need to steal anything and neither does my son the manager is a racist prick and I'll never spend money at this shit hole store again!!!!!!,negative
"Yorby Yost knows what he did and should be ashamed of himself. Just because your president is racist, doesn't mean you won't get yours when YOU screw up.",negative
"This review only relates to my experience with an online purchase. I have purchased several items from an actual Dicks's store without any issues. In fact, it's my go to store for sports equipment. They have a vast online selection, but their shipping takes too long. Expected delivery for a shirt is almost two weeks. This will be my first and last time purchasing anything online from Dick's. Much easier to purchase from Amazon.",negative
"Don't try to special order anything from the store. Apparently they don't make as much if you special order rather than buying in the store. I spent 10 minutes and went through no less than four employees trying to buy a $100 Nike windbreaker. They didn't have my size in stock so I assume they can special order for me because I didn't see it on the website. Each time I talk to someone I was pawned off to someone else and made to walk from one side of the store to another and then asked to go all the way to the back. Even though the store wasn't that busy, they obviously wanted to help other people who intended to buy things at their store, rather than help me special order a rather expensive jacket. This store is always more expensive than anywhere else, but there are some things you can only get here. I think they know that and that's why they have the attitude they do. After voicing my frustrations to one less person, who still couldn't help me, I walked out of the store. I guess they'd rather sell a little $10 drink it to someone rather than special order a $100 item for someone. That's sad",negative
Dicks is a great sporting good store I've been going there for years they got them all over the country so they make it real convenient and I think anything I want I go to Dick's there number one.huge selection happy faces working there very helpful employees,positive
"I wanted to extend my personal thanks to Yorby who assisted me with a shoe exchange today. Your wide selection, competitive prices and exceptional customer service are what keep me coming back as a customer. Dick's is one of the last sporting goods stores around that offers an impressive and quality assortment of sporting goods, clothing and footwear. Keep up the good work guys.",positive
"Came here to browse items for camping gear. Came across the golfing simulator which does not state to ask for help when using. Keep in mind we are adults and not teenage kids. (You can hit balls towards a simulated sceen). As we attempted to use the simulator an employee whom must be in high school came over stating, ""Can you read that sign for me? This is for paying customers or you need to pay for simulator use."" Needless to say I will NOT be buying any camping gear or anything further at DICKS SPORTING GOODS due to this child's attitude. Very inappropriate and left as soon as this rude employee was done.",negative
"I went to Dick's Sporting Goods to try on some shoes. I was greeted by Glen, and he answered every shoe question I had. He was very knowledgeable and would highly recommend going and seeing Glen for shoes!",positive
"Went to Dick's for Bluetooth headphones. The selection wasn't great, but they had a few quality brands. Their sales items were somehow still more expensive than Amazon, but oh well, I wanted a pair today. After standing around the headphones for 10+ mins I was never asked if I needed assistance. Fine, I went to google and Amazon for reviews. I decided in a pair but needed someone to get them out of the case for me. I see 4 employees standing around monitoring the shoe sale section, not assisting anyone so I walked up and asked for assistance and was informed they could not help me, I would need a cashier. I'm trying to buy $150 headphones I figure one of them could get someone to come over and assist me. They did not. I ask a cashier for assistance and they ask me to hold on. I wait 10-15 mins near the headphones again, no one comes to assist. The clearance shoe section with no customers was heavily attended too, but apparently buying headphones is so specialized only 3 swamped cashiers can assist. I just left as it became apparent in order to purchase headphones I was going to need to borrow a Coleman chair and set up a tent for the week. I won't be going back there, for anything, ever.",negative
"I went here to get my dad a Father's Day gift and I decided on a yeti tumbler. The shelf was labeled 29.99 and had multi colored yetis on the shelf. When I got to register the cashier told me 39.99 and I advised they were on sale and showed him the sticker on the shelf which had the sale price. He told me that price was for 18 oz tumblers that weren't even on the shelf. I asked to speak to manager who was extremely rude. He told me the ""customers"" must have removed the price tag and placed at least 7 tumblers in the wrong place. I told him that was absolutely ridiculous and they should honor the price since that is the tag on the shelf. The manager said no and then just literally walked away. Needless to say, I did not buy the tumbler and dicks sporting goods lost a customer for good.",negative
"Purchased a Louisville Slugger Prime 917 bat there on Saturday 05/26/17, for my 14 year old son. Bat immediately developed a rattle in barrel before first summer high school hitting practice or facing live pitching. Tried to exchange but their policy is once the plastics off, you have to file a claim with the manufacturer, which took over an hour on-line and I have to pay to ship it to Louisville. My policy is I don't waste my time or money at a business that won't stand behind a product, especially a $400 faulty new baseball bat. HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE. Don't waste your time coming here, especially for baseball gear. Try Extra Innings in Mesa, Rawlings Outlet in Chandler, Big Five in Ahwatukee, or AZ Mound in Tempe.",negative
"W-O-W!!! This is certainly a massively HUUUUUGE Dick's!! Who the heck ever said size doesn't matter?!?! Just kiddin' ... Pun definitely intended ;) But, in all seriousness ... This place literally has ALL of THAT, and then SOME!! The bottom line is that unless you are looking for something obscure, vintage, or antique/ancient related to sporting goods you will either find exactly what you are looking for here, or you will at least find something close to/similar to what you are looking for ... I'm pretty sure that these massive Dick's stores have put most of the smaller sporting good stores out of business by this point ... I mean how could another sporting store realistically compete with this place? This store is so big and has so much cool stuff in it that I walk around this place just for fun to check out all the neat things everywhere. If you love sports this place is like being a kid in a candy store ... Your eyes open up real wide, and there is literally such a variety of sporting items that it can be nearly overwhelming! The cool thing about dicks is that they typically have a lot of sales going on, which is great ... The odd part was seeing more employees inside than customers ... Yet not one of the employees asked if they could help me look for anything ....hmmmm I dunno maybe they were intimidated by me?? It was rather amusing when I went to check out and they had only one register open. There got to be quite a line when one of the customers seemed to be having issues checking out. Then, finally they called over another employee, who was probably just hanging out somewhere in the store ""playing"" on their cell phone, to open up another register. Many of the employees I walked by seemed to be doing A LOT of NOTHING ... Dick's definitely deserves at least 4 stars because I've never seen another sporting goods store anywhere in the US come close to offering what this place does. It truly is a one stop shop when it comes to sporting/athletic gear, clothes, devices, products, etc. The only negative is the lazy careless employees that work here. At the very least it would be more productive for them to stand/hang out in close proximity to the entrance and greet people walking in, and asking them if they need help to find anything.",positive
"Dicks is terrible, their customer service is way below what is expected from one of the biggest retailers in the country. I went in to buy my son baseball pants ahead of his first game. They didn't have any in his size of the ones the team required so I was told to order online and use the expedited shipping and they would be here in time. The day they were supposed to arrive I got an email telling me that they wouldn't be there until 4 days later. I then called customer service and they offer to pay me back for the expedited shipping. They thought that not charging me for something that I didn't get was service recovery. Unreal, I won't be back.",negative
Very poor customer service. Long lines and they definitely don't care about keeping their business. Manager sweet as pie with the good looking men and totally rude to the young blond and her polite kid. Look elsewhere for your sporting goods.,negative
"They looked like they had a good selection of apparel, but sadly that wasn't why I came. The selection of golf club head covers was pathetic. They literally had three genetic ugly ones and then a bunch of cartoon driver covers. A waste of my time.",negative
"And the nightmare continues in Tempe this time. A simple tune up and flat tire tube replacement. I get the bike back with a new air valve that requires me to purchase a special valve to fill it with air. I get home and the seat is raised so high I can't ride it. Then after adjusting the seat back, I try to ride the bike and only the front brakes are working!!! Back tire brake is snuggly against the tire!!! Good thing I didn't ride it fast or I would have injured myself. Manager Josh says he'll have ""Melissa"" fix it. Last time she ""fixed"" my bike, the tire came off when I was riding it!!!! So no, I don't want Melissa ""fixing"" my bike! Here's a suggestion - try hiring people over the age of 16! Especially when I can get seriously injured by their lack of skills and knowledge! If I had to do it over again I would NOT buy a bike from Dick's Sporting Goods!",negative
The service was amazing! J.D. Helped me find my golfing outfit and kept showing me new things to try on. It seemed like he really loved his job and that means a lot! Also I couldn't find a black Nike hat anywhere in the store and one of the employees looked everywhere again for me just to be kind! Even though he didn't find one I really appreciate the effort!,positive
This place has the highest prices and the worst customer service of any store I've ever been to. The staff is snotty undertrained and doesn't care if you spend money there or not. The corporate policy is screw the customer.,negative
"They had volley lite balls in stock both times I went to get one. This isn't always the case with other sporting good stores! Also, after about 5 weeks the ball lost a bit of air. I tried pumping it and it held for a couple days. Since there was no obvious puncture I brought it back to the store for possible return. Even though returns are done within 4 weeks and by now it had been almost 6 weeks they made an exception and exchanged the ball! Also, it had my daughters name written in permanent marker on it and they still took it back - usually you can't return when you write on them. I thought the customer service was superb!",positive
"This place was great, then they decided to stop selling firearms. I will not be shopping here again even if they begin selling firearms again. Way to cave in to pressure Dick's,",negative
"WOW1 What a great experience! Everyone there was friendly, helpful, knowledgeable, and considerate. It was a truly amazing experience! Compared to my experience at Cabela's I was SHOCKED by the impressive, respectful, and knowledgeable staff. Prices are fair, people are kind. What a great place to shop for outdoor and fitness gear!",positive
"This is based on customer service for returns. I bought a nice NF jacket here and, obviously, dropped a pretty penny on it (I'll say!).. only to be on work travel in Cali (where I really needed it) and have the zipper come out (made in China or what?). I was seriously peeved: I have bought lots of non-name-brand sweaters and jackets before and *never* have those $30 jackets had a zipper come out!!... to add to that pissed feeling, I'm thinking Dick's won't exchange it because it's been well over 30 days. ahh... sigh of relief. I called this Tempe location to inquire about the exchange (citing the date of purchase and the cause of wanting to exchange it) and the gal on the phone (I imagine the manager) was SUPER nice and understanding - she told me she hates when that happens and that, of course they'd exchange it and to come on in and she'd take care of it for me. So, I did and got a new jacket (I did check it for zipper quality, hopefully that screening was good enough)! A+ for customer service on returns with receipts over 30 days!",positive
"So uh yeah they sell sporting goods here. They have a great selection and the store is really nice (it's 2 stories) and the sales men don't bother you to much. I like the store but the prices are about average, which really doesn't make it special in my book.",negative
"So, I was looking to get a Yoga mat, and thought that Dicks would be a great place to go to get something like that. I know this location is brand new, as I used to live right near it, and literally watched them build it from the ground up. This location has amazing hours! Open late most nights, and is right off the expressway. you cant miss it! Its in the same district as Ikea, off the I-10. Anyways, this place is well lit, has a ton of parking, and is so well organized its not even funny. Not a thing was out of place. It has two floors, and carries a ton of stuff. I cruised through the womens section of clothing, and they have shoes, running stuff, you name it, its there! I was able to find the Yoga mats, and they had a little selection in the back of the store. Did I mention this place is really well lit? Anyways, they had a small variety of mats. They also had a beginner mat set, that came with a video, a block and a yoga strap. 25 bucks! most of the mats I saw were about 20 bucks alone, so for the extra 5 bucks, I sprug for the extras. I think I got a pretty good deal. While I was wandering around, a staff member asked if there was anything I needed. Just talked to him for a minute about yoga mats, and he said that was the only spot in the store that they would be at. Seemed to know his stuff. I really like Dick's Sporting goods. Well organized, amazing hours, well lit, friendly staff. I will return in the future!",positive
"This is one of the few dick sporting good location but has poor service. Are used to be a regular customer this location after getting burned several times with poor service I have switch stores. Dick's Sporting Goods is one of my favorite companies and I will continue to shop there. Location at South Park, which is the flagship store, is excellent. Pineville location is also superior. Unfortunately the Matthew location is just not hitting all cylinders",negative
"Usual Dicks made a full lap around the store without making eye contact with a single employee. 4/19/15 - 7:15- 7:40. Dang they suck just like my last review of Dicks Gastonia. Same issues, just piss poor.",negative

I was really excited to order a Kayak from them ordering it was fine. They didnt have the one I needed in stock so I had the store order it for me. They said that it would take two weeks to get there which was good bc summer is here. I called when they said it would be ready and they said it wasnt in. I called every week for several weeks asking if it was in. They kept telling me not on this truck call back. Finally when it had been a month I called again and they told me that when i ordered it was out of stock and they had to get it from a manufacturer which takes longer and it would be in next week. Now its summer and no Kayak. I think that the people in this store have no clue what they are talking about and they all seem like they really dont care. Still waiting for my Kayak after it comes in I will not be back into the store again.,negative
"This Dick's used to have excellent customer service. I don't know what changed, but they don't any more. In fact, the people who work there are now kind of... Ok, well, perhaps that joke is a little TOO obvious. Seriously, though. I don't care how much cool stuff you have or how awesome your sales are. If I ask you if you have a shoe in a certain size and you answer ""probably not"" and walk away without even looking at me, I won't be buying anything from your store. Well, I suppose this is why they invented Zappos.",negative
"I come here every once in a while to pick up some sports items. Mostly tennis balls and some fitness gear/clothing. This place is rather large and expansive, offering a lot of selections in shoes, brand names, gear for the popular sports... so get ready to walk around a bit if you are shopping around or looking for something specific. My last visit here wasn't particularly great. It seemed like the store was undergoing a re-organization so there was a whole section that was in disarray and/or moving somewhere else. The staff that work here seem to be mostly high-school students... You get what you pay for I guess.... they can be helpful at times, but sometimes they can be wrapped up in their own work-life dramas and interpersonal relationships. This is just by observation as I saw these two girl cashiers gossiping about one of the other employees or the managers while I waited in line for forever.",negative
"I don't often find my way to sporting goods stores. It's probably because we have so much stuff already. So when I end up at Dick's, it is because I'm looking for something specific. But this place is so large, I usually need help finding it. Sure, they have sections where you can narrow your search, but you'll often need help really getting down to the nitty-gritty. That's where it can be problematic. It's like the old problem of having everything in the world - where would you put it? That's the issue here. They have all sorts of stuff, and have (apparently) figured out where to put it. You just can't find it. And often, you can't find someone to help you find it. If you do, you're typically okay.",negative
"We came in today, a Saturday afternoon, even with an appointment we had to wait for a little while. It was packed! I was lucky again to find a dress! But this time a bridal reception dress! :) MUCH THANKS TO KARLA who looked after me! I was fixated on a certain style and sure enough the last dress Karla brought was the exact opposite.... and I said Yes to that dress! Thank you David's Bridal! My wedding party and I definitely recommend this location. Unfortunately, our experience with the Eglinton location was not as pleasant.",positive
This was my 2nd visit to a Bridal store and I still wasn't sure what I wanted but I did know it HAD to fit my small budget. Luckily I had a talented and patient consultant Maria working with me. She listened to my needs and pulled styles I would never think of but looked good on me! And even better it fit my budget. I would definitely recommend Maria and the rest of the team at David's Bridal for anyone else that's going dress shopping.,positive
"I was here with my best friend and next bride. We didn't have an appointment as we walked in when they had just opened. They were kind enough to find us a consultant anyways. We lucked out! My bride had no clue and I mean 0 idea as to what style what theme she was going for. Rachel was our consultant. She met us with a huge smile and an awesome attitude. Even though we had an I don't know attitude. By process of elimination through questions and observations Rachel brought us 2 dresses to try. From there on it was more of like putting together the perfect man. I like this part of this and that part of that. Through the whole process Rachel was super patient and super helpful. Her smile and awesome attitude never faltered. Down to the end we were stuck between 2. The bride basically was saying if they could only put this on here and do this to this one. Rachel found a way to get Brad Pitt and Orlando Bloom meshed together, confirmed with alterations tailor and boom! We have THE dress! She said YES! If you're getting married, looking for a dress and feel like you don't know where to get started this is definitely somewhere to start and the service, you just can't go wrong.",positive
"I had an extremely mediocre experience trying on wedding dresses here and that mediocrity descended into deplorable when it came to alterations. David's has some nice dresses but the associates rush you into ordering and don't seem very happy when you ask to try on some different styles (I tried on about 5 and she seemed a bit annoyed). At this point the service was on par with my expectations, being a big box store. You get what you pay for. I decided to let them alter my dress, figuring they'd do a decent job since they've done so many of the same style. It ended up costing nearly as much as my dress, which I could've lived with if it weren't for the lazy quality of work and rudeness I faced from the seamstress. She used two bra inserts to create a faux push up insert that looked strange and felt uncomfortable (she didn't even bother hiding them inside the dress so you could literally see them from the side when I'm wearing it). When I told her that the top of the dress was too tight, she insisted nothing more could be done. Overall she was extremely defensive and dismissive about any concerns I had. Isn't that the whole point of the final fitting though? To get all the tweaks right?? All she wanted was my signature acknowledging that her work was done. I ended up going to a local seamstress who was able to fix this mess for me and I severely regret not doing so in the first place.",negative
"Great service and kindest workers. I was buying my prom dress and the women who I wish I remembered her name helped me through it all, whenever I needed something like beads, shoes etc she would run to get them and help me out! Can't explain by amazing service and defiantly would recommend for both prom/random dresses and wedding dresses! Soooo grateful for their service!",positive
"David's Bridal was the first of four stores that I visited this past week for my gown hunting adventure with my family (who flew in specifically for the purpose of helping me find the dress I will get married in). I don't think it's fair to write a review on a bridal store based on whether or not it is the location where I will purchase my bridal gown, so I am going to focus on the dresses themselves, the service, the prices, and any other tidbits that may be interesting for brides-to-be (and in some cases, members of the bridal party as well). My hope is that my review will help you make an informed decision about whether or not this store is worth visiting during your own bridal gown adventure. PRO: For each style of gown, they have a wide range of sizes ready to try on, so you don't have to squeeze yourself into a sample size if you're a bit bigger or find yourself swimming in a too-large gown if you're on the petite side. It makes it easy to see what the gown will ACTUALLY look like on you once ordered. CON: Having multiple sizes per gown means that there aren't as many different styles available as it appears when you first walk into the store. Once I had narrowed down exactly what I was looking for in a dress in terms of look and details, I only ended up with about 6 gowns that really fit my criteria in the entire store. PRO: They have everything you could possibly need to picture yourself as you will look on your wedding day. Don't have the right bra? They'll supply one for you to use during your visit. Didn't bring shoes? No problem! Curious how a necklace will look with your #1 choice gown? Go ahead and try one on! CON: It's easy to get overwhelmed by the sheer amount of bridal STUFF in front of you and forget that the dress has to come first, and the details can come later. PRO: Plenty of decent sized dressing rooms (with my name and wedding date posted on the door for a personalized touch) with plenty of mirrors and space to marvel at how good you look in a wedding gown (go ahead and ogle). CON: There were no apple boxes/platform to stand on! I didn't even know what I was missing until I arrived at the next bridal store on my list! As a 5'2"" woman who will undoubtedly have to shorten whatever dress I end up getting, I feel like I didn't get to see the dress in as good a light as possible. Maybe they had boxes somewhere and I should have asked to be elevated when trying on the gowns? It was my first stop and I didn't really think to request this. PRO: My budget was around $1000 before alterations (with the willingness to go over if it was the absolute PERFECT dress for me) and I think everything I pulled that I loved was $1000 or under. Even a couple of the White by Vera Wang dresses I grabbed were still within my budget. You have a very good chance of finding something that fits both you and your wedding budget. CON: Less expensive dresses do equal less expensive details and features (for the most part). That being said, my favourite gown ($1000 on the nose) was stunning, and featured delicate bead-work and fabric that felt good on my skin. As well, the Vera Wang dresses had very luxurious fabrics that were beautiful, yet affordable. PRO: My consultant Paige was very helpful, and answered any and all questions that I had. She took my measurements and saved my size and favourite dress style into their system in the event that I decide to go back later and purchase my gown at David's. There was never any pressure to buy that day, and since we had a bit of extra time left in my appointment slot once I finished trying on dresses, Paige indulged my desire to see my sister in some bridesmaid dresses and continued to assist us well after I was back in my street clothes. As well, I was delighted to learn that they were cool with us taking pictures of our favourite choices (watching too much Say Yes To The Dress made me think that photos in a bridal store were a HUGE no-no), and those photos were actually incredibly helpful in my decision making process. CON: No cons about Paige. She was great and made me feel important and beautiful. But as a warning to other brides: I visited David's at 2:00PM on a Thursday. There were only a couple of other customers in the store which made for the ideal shopping experience. If you go on an evening or weekend, I imagine this place gets quite harried and I wouldn't be surprised if each consultant had to help more than one bride at a time. If you can, try to go on a weekday morning or afternoon so you can be the center of your consultants attention. tl;dr conclusion: You can go in with almost any budget and find something you'll be proud to call yours on your wedding day. If you want to keep shopping simple, this store can easily be your one-stop shop for all your bridal and bridal party needs.",positive
"I had an AMAZING experience at the David's Bridal in Mississauga. I went in after having two underwhelming experiences at other stores in Windsor (where I'm from). I went with friends, then I went with family...big mistake. EVERYONE has an opinion about something and just want to put you in a dress THEY want. Ladies, if you are paying for the dress yourself...you are entitled to go by yourself & make the decision on your own. The consultants are there to help you find a dress that works best for you & your body shape. So I went there quietly on my own on a rainy Wednesday morning. My sales girl, Telma...was nothing short of amazing. Get this girl a raise!!!! Her knowledge, passion & guidance of all things Bridal was obvious throughout the whole appointment. She pulled a Vera Wang dress for me and it was 'the one'. It was nothing that I'd ever expect to see myself in or even fall in love with, but she had a good feeling about it. The manager Lynette came out and made me feel even more confident that THIS was my dress. They both reassured my doubts with that extra dose of confidence that I needed. After the first appointment I came back 2 days later to order it. Yes, the bell ceremony is odd but kind of sweet. You do have the option of not doing it if you're uncomfortable. Also paying for the dress upfront is also kind of annoying but understandable. This is a chain store with lots of inventory so they have to keep things moving. It's not a bridal 'boutique' where they can hold your dress for months at a time. You get it, have your moment and go! All in all, a VERY pleasant experience at DB. I'll be happy to return for my alterations once my dress arrives :)",positive
"David's Bridal is really just a bridal/wedding factory. It churns things in and out at a lower cost. I don't think that's a surprise to anyone, Nonetheless, you can still be the best at what you do and how you do it. I just don't think they're the best. The selection just looks cheap. You can be inexpensive and still have a quality look. Their staff also seem complacent. My biggest issue was that I got measured for my bridesmaid dress by their staff and the dress came in too small. 2 inches too small! I went into the store and they were able to zip it up at the cost of my lungs. They then said that I was ""inbetween sizes"". WHY would you order the smaller size then if I'm in between? I also find that they NEVER answer their phone the first time. I usually have to call 3 times in a row to actually speak with someone. Once, I was even put on hold for over 10 minutes. I hung up and called back to talk to a new CSR. I'll never go back - unless another friend decides to go for her wedding.",negative
"First store I decided to visit and had an enjoyable experience. I went on a Thursday afternoon so the place was empty and I had lots of time to look around. They have a good selection of affordable beautiful gowns and were able to accommodate my short timeframe (4 months). The consultant I had was friendly and helpful. I didn't find ""the one"" here but it did hold a close second! My only negatives are the lighting isn't the best -- made the ivory dresses look yellow, and I didn't think the seamstress was as knowledgeable as she portrayed. She was quick to say yes to any of my requests (adding sleeves and a higher neckline) but wanted to use scraps instead of suggesting I purchase the material myself. I wasn't thrilled about the idea of patch work on my wedding gown. I'm sure she is great with your typical fitting but for those brides that may need a bit more than the typical l would choose another seamstress.",positive
"I went to David's Bridal for my wedding dress a few weeks ago. I was immediately greeted and me and my group were escorted to a dressing room with chairs set up and a little heart sticky note on the door with my name and wedding date (cute!) The saleswoman (Xeni) was very helpful - especially considering I had no idea what I wanted. She brought me many different dresses until we finally narrowed it down. When I had gotten down to two dresses, she brought out veils and tiaras for me to try and complete the look. When I chose my dress there was a ritual to follow with some kind words from the store manager about my special day and a bell ringing ceremony. A little odd for someone shy like me, but still sweet. The only downside was having to pay for the entire dress cost up front, but understandable. I liked that when I told her my budget, she did not give me dresses above the cost to try make a bigger sale. Overall I had a great experience!",positive
"David's Bridal is a total joke. Out of all the places I've been this is the worst place you can go. You do not feel special here, you are just another 'number'. I've been twice now... hoping the way they treat customers is just a fluke... but sadly it seems to be their way. They had me scheduled for an appt at 2:30 and no one came to help me until 3:15.... I was about to walk out the door. My mother, sister and best friend were all in shock by the poor customer service... the ladies standing around at the front counter are useless... and have quite an attitude on them. I actually found a dress I love there but am SUPER reluctant to purchase it from them because of the service I had. I am going to try and find it elsewhere. My advice to you if you are going dress shopping.. go ANYWHERE else, because I guarantee you will be robbed of the 'special' feeling you should get while dress shopping. My advice to David's Bridal is to book less appts, have customer service and take the TIME to care about your customers. If I could go on forever about them I would.. cuz I have about 20 stories where I was treated horribly (btw I am not a diva.. just a normal gal trying to find a nice dress)",negative
"I would give it 1/2 a star if I could.. If you're looking for a relaxing, comfortable dress shopping experience, do not go to David's Bridal. The staff is extremely rude and they do not listen to their customer's needs. I booked an appointment to try on a few dresses a couple months ago and did not have a good experience. The lady that helped me did not smile once and wasn't very helpful at all. It just seemed like she didn't want to be there and acted miserable the whole time. That alone turned me right off and made me feel extremely uncomfortable. But what topped it off was the customer service on the phone. They talk to you as if you're inconveniencing them! So bottom line, if you're looking for a good wedding dress shopping experience, go to a small boutique and avoid the big box stores like David's Bridal, because they are not personable and do not care about anything but making a sale. if you're looking for a walmart experience, then maybe david's bridal is for you. good day",negative
"Denise is very talented, wonderful to work with and very friendly. With her Italy design school background, she can envision what will accentuate your features and look best on you. The moment I walked into the store, she picked a dress for me. Best selection by far of any special occasion dress you may want. I tried on numerous Mother of the Bride dresses from many stores and ultimately went with the dress she picked out. She redesigned the neckline of the dress to make it flattering for me and spent countless hours doing the alterations by hand. With all the work it entailed, she had the dress ready to go in plenty of time. She goes above and beyond to help her customers look their best. Received many compliments on the dress. I will definitely be back for future special occasion dresses. Karen G.",positive
"Denise is amazing, she went above and beyond to help my daughter find the perfect dress! She even went out of her way to order her a dress last minute and worked late to complete the alterations! We love her and will go back for every special occasion.",positive
She has the best selection in Scottsdale. The most unique and flattering dresses. I found my rehearsal dinner dress here and am still in love with it in all of the photos. Denise is also really honest. She won't let you buy anything that she doesn't think looks absolutely fabulous. She won't stop until you find something amazing!,positive
"Originally, I gave Designer Studio a great review because my daughter and I loved the dress selection, and the owner, Denise was very friendly and accommodating. Unfortunately I will have to change my review to one star. The reason I am changing the rating is because i don't want anyone else to go through the same traumatic and disappointing experience as my daughter and me. My daughter picked out a prom dress from Designer Studio that she loved and was very excited to wear. When we tried the dress on, however, the zipper came open in the back after it was zipped repeatedly. Denise said not to worry, that she would reinforce the zipper and alter the length so that it wasn't an issue on prom night. We left the dress with her for at least a month. She never called to let us know the dress was ready, so we followed up ourselves. My daughter picked up her dress and was SO excited to wear it to prom. We had put hours and hours into finding the right dress, and it was perfect for her. Unfortunately, the night of prom, about 20 minutes before her date was to pick her up, the zipper again split up the back. We tried to zip it at least three times, and it would go up and stay put for a few minutes but then eventually would split again. It wasn't that the dress was too tight...it fit perfectly and even had a little room but the zipper just wouldn't stay closed. We thought that the issue had been addressed properly, but apparently not. My daughter was in tears and so incredibly disappointed. We didn't know what to do. Luckily, her older sister had a dress from a couple years ago that just happened to fit perfectly. Even though my younger daughter didn't like her sister's dress and was incredibly disappointed about her own dress she rallied and left the house ready to put this behind her. I called Denise to let her know what had happened and she was surprised, as according to Denise the company that makes the dress usually doesn't have any issues. I told her I was sure that was true but we DID have an issue. She said she would give me a store credit and I told her I would bring the dress back in. I thought about it after our conversation, and after thinking about her offer for store credit felt strongly that she should have offered a refund. After all, it was months of planning and she said she had fixed the zipper issue, and the night of prom my daughter couldn't even wear the dress! When I brought the dress back in Denise was very nice at first until I asked for a refund. I explained why I thought a refund was appropriate. Denise pulled at the zipper pretty hard several times and since it didn't come undone when she was pulling it she said that even though she believed that there had been a problem the night of the event that since the zipper was not coming undone when she pulled it she could not refund my money. I told her I had no idea why it wasn't coming undone but that it had very definitely split up the back several times the night of prom and wasn't wearable. She said I'm sorry, I can't refund you. When I said (and I was angry at this point, this entire scenario seemed very wrong) that I would just take a store credit she then told me I could only have $100 credit toward another dress next year! The dress I bought cost $565. So not only would she not refund me, she wouldn't even give me a store credit worth the price of the dress! I was extremely angry at this point and basically told Denise I own a business as well and would never treat a customer this way. I also said I would have been a repeat customer if this had been handled fairly and I had been refunded. I truly would have been. So maybe she would have had to refund one dress, but then had the sale of several dresses many years down the line due to a satisfied customer. I go to many events each year where a formal dress is required. So now Denise has lost me as a customer forever, and I will not hesitate to make everyone I know aware of the very poor customer service here. Denise is very, very nice and accommodating unless there is a problem, but then watch out if there is an issue. Save yourself the risk and go elsewhere.",negative
I was having a very difficult time deciding on a dress to wear to my daughter's wedding. A week before the wedding I decided I hated the dress I had decided to purchase so I was out relooking. I stumbled upon Designer Studio in the shops at gainey village. Denise picked a stunning dress for me. She altered it four days so I could wear it the day of the wedding. I looked and felt beautiful. Thank you Denise for being you!,positive
"Not sure if anyone knows this....Dollar Tree is essentially an Internet company. There is no ability to contact therir corporate offices. Good luck trying to get a hold of the DM. Unavailable at all times. Dollar Tree corporation has no idea how badly there DM's and above are a complete waste of money with absolutely no accountability. Now, the store managers are busting their butts with little to no help from their DM. The store managers are what makes the store work in spite of the lack of concern from their DMs. Hats off to the backbone of Dollar Tree (their store managers). There is something extremely wrong with this corporation. I dug a little deeper in an effort to file a complaint with dollar tree reference some issues with how employees were treated during a recent store move. Guess what, the contact number provided lead to a phone tree and voice mail. Considering there are several products from china, one has to wonder if this is a front company???????",positive
Great place with great prices on many name brand grocery items. My problem is I usually leave with more items than i was shopping for! The grocery items are unbelievable since all items are $1.00.,positive
"Love Dollar Tree. It is my go to store when I need reading glasses, batteries, water, candy :), etc. I enjoy going up and down the aisles and seeing what's new...there's always something.",positive
"Am I tight w/my money? Yes. Yes, I am at times. Where do I go to stretch my money the most? Dollar Tree. Why? Because everything is $1.00. But, you do have to be smart too. I've seen name brand hand soap in there for $1, but have seen this same brand at WalMart for 87 cents. So, I do believe that there is some trickery going on here. I can buy 24-count Tylenol PM (well, generic Canadian stuff) here as well as Christmas wrapping paper, bows, nametags, etc. All for one dollar, folks. I would have probably paid double if not triple at Target or Walmart for this sort of stuff. Some of their shelf-stable food scares me a little. I see lots of dented/bent stuff made in China that has labels in . Just be careful as you may end up w/a case of botulism.",positive
"Yep! One of the best dollar trees in the Phoenix Metro area! I have been to the Dollar Tree in Chandler, on Via Linda in Scottsdale, the one by PV mall, and another one in Hancock Plaza in PV/Phoenix. This Dollar Tree is by far the cleanest, most organized, and well kept store. The staff is very helpful and friendly and I have never ever had a problem with this location. They also seem to have the items I need in stock. Their food items are the freshest too.",positive
"This Dollar Tree (DT) location in Fountain Hills is the best one out of the lot. I don't normally go to Dollar Trees because the selection is so bad, but when I'm taking the 87 to Shea into Scottsdale, I make sure I stop by this location in Fountain Hills for the small necessities, like greeting cards, wrapping paper, and even makeup. I really like their plastic boxes for organizational purposes. I've bought food (like jam and cookies) also from this location, and have had no problems. This DT location is very clean, and well kempt, which is unlike any other DT location. The staff, particularly an elderly lady, is really nice and helpful. I highly recommend this location over the others for values.",positive
"This is the most organized and cleanest Dollar Store that I've been to! In the gift aisles, all of the gifts were neatly placed on the shelves. All of the similar items were even grouped together (Example: all of the rubber duckies were together). Now that is a lot or organization! It was fun to go through the greeting cards and all of the aisles. This store has a lot more products in stock! Store Hours: Sunday: 10am - 7pm Monday - Saturday: 8am - 9pm",negative
The staff in this store are awesome. Beth and Sarah are truly the best. They do everything to make their customer happy. I live here in Vegas and shop at Donald Pliner in the forum shops all the time The selection is great,positive
"The store is located at the forum shops at Caesar's Palace. The space is well organized. I am a big fan of Donald J Pliner shoes and they make up most of my closet. The shoes can be expensive so I only buy them on sale. At the store you can frequently get sale items at an additional 50% off. A bonus from buying at the store is free shipping. I was in Vegas, bought a couple of pairs and had them shipped to Seattle Great shoes, great prices, super friendly staff.",positive
"So...I used to be a purse girl. I feel like most of us ladies are either purse girls or shoe girls.... Now here comes my problem. After visiting Donald Pliner the last few times in Vegas I am officially a purse AND shoe girl. Something's gotta give and it is probably gonna be my bank account! I met my new besties on a flight home from Vegas and have since traveled back in the last few months with them a couple of times. Where did they take me you ask? Well to Donald Pliner for shoes of course. They are big fans and also knew my shoe collection was sad at best. First stop after the flight in is the Donald Pliner store for a look at the new styles as well as sale items with my favorite sales associate Debra. When I say favorite, I mean out of all the stores I frequent. She always greets me with a smile and has my shopping habits, likes, dislikes stored in the system so when I say ""Did I like these last time?"" she can honestly tell me yes or no. Debra and everyone else there are friendly and provide awesome service. We tend to try on about 20-30 pairs of shoes when we are there and never a complaint! I also like that I tend to stay in the sale range and there is never judgement on the price point I am at (I know there should not be judgement, but sometimes at the high end stores in Vegas that is exactly what happens). They have all kinds of fabulous boots as well as heels. My feet are very sensitive so I really never wear heels but this store introduced me to a stack heel. This type of heel more evenly distributes the weight load over the ball and heel of your feet, leading to a much more comfortable shoe. I have walked up and down the strip for miles in one pair. Instead of having to wear my tennis shoes I can wear a cute pair of shoes with my outfit while getting in my walk! My strappy stack heels are my favorite addition to my ever growing shoes collection! The most recent visit a couple of days ago, I brought my husband and they happily sedated him with a beverage and cookies so I could do my shopping. There was a DJ playing live music which was a nice touch to the shopping experience. Thank you to Donald Pliner and Debra for such an awesome, customized shoe buying experience. You have changed my perspective on shoes for life!",positive
"I think the associates assumed we weren't going to buy anything and were ignoring us until they could tell we were actually interested in making a purchase. After that they were amazing. Some of the shoes are completely impractical, but Mr. J found the most amazing pair of grey/red dress shoes with a matching belt. He's extremely pleased with them and will probably purchase again in the future. I wouldn't buy shoes here (my size is harder to find) but I will drool over what Mr. J calls ""the shiny"" while he conducts business. So much shiny! Also, the collection of masks in the store is amazing. I loved the aesthetics of the place.",positive
"This is a review of Pliner's approach and style (truly original, but certainly ""not for everyone,) this location, and especially their sales person - Milijana, or Mia as she introduced herself. Making my purchase on 12/18 during their holiday sale I literally tried on 25 pairs of shoes before making my final selection - a half-lacquered pair of black suede shoes unlike anything I've previously seen. While the store did not have my size in stock, Mia brought me shoes made from the same mold and informed me that not only could the size I need (11) be mailed to my home, but it could be accomplished with no tax and free shipping since I lived in Ohio. In retrospect I wish I'd have bought more pairs of shoes while I was there, but as it stands they've guaranteed I'll return on my next Vegas visit.",positive
"OK, so what am I -- a guy -- writing up Donald Pliner for? Well, yeah, they do have some men's shoes, but that's not why we were there. I say ""we"" because my wife Lynn (aka Imelda) has a thing for Donald Pliner shoes. While in Hawaii, she picked up an opalescent turtle-like leather show with a metal heel that was -- well, you get (or most of you get) the idea . . . So, being the wonderful, charming, AND faithful husband I am, I told her that Donald Pliner had a store here . . . . Wonderful shoes, but low inventory (""We're out of that one in your size"") and several pairs that SHOULD have been comfortable but weren't and -- well, you get the idea. I think she'll still be buying them at Nordie's.",negative
"We've been here quite a few times and no issues. People are helpful, but not too excessive, which is good. We bought my husband's business shoes and those are my favorite shoes over the ones I got off Groupon. They carry brands that are nice looking, reasonably priced, and comfortable to walk in. He preferred the men's dress shoes here over that of Macy's and the more expensive Department stores which were usually more than double and some even triple the price for about the same look and less comfort. My son bought his 8th grade graduation shoes here. We couldn't find the right size, but the sales associate helped us and was able to locate the shoes in the right size in a different area of the store. The store is neat, organized every time we have gone in. No complaints of any type here. Oh, we've also done returns, exchanges and no issues with those either. The checkout process is easy, too.",positive
Not a very good selection of shoes especially when it's buy one get one half off but they had what I wanted the customer service was great and it being a holiday sale it was surprisingly slow good for me,positive
"Horrible customer service provided by the manager michelle at this location.. Gilbert, crossroads. i wanted this really cute pair of puma tennis shoes, teal and grey. I found sveral of the same pairs of puma shoes priced differently. The size 6 1/ 2 was priced at 30.00, and the size 7 priced at 75.00 . I spoke with 2 different assocites, one girl with dark back short hair, and the gentleman, both associates stated they would give me the size 7s for 30.00. When the dark haired girl rang up the size 7 pumas, they rang up for 60.00. Not 30, not 75.00. The girl stated, she will still give them to me for 30.00 since all of that particular shoe is marked wrong. The associate was unauthorized to process the override.. when the manager michelle came over, she rang up both shoes, they both came up with different prices, and told me i would have to pay 60.00 for the size 7 shoe i wanted. I advised her all of the same shoes on the clearance rack are marked differently. She stated someone missed marked them. Michelle stated i could have the size 6 1/2 for the price it was marked which was 30.00. I advised her that 2 of her associates said i would pay 30.00.. The manager Michelle didnt care.. i told her that she lost my business .. i will never shop at Famous Footwear. . Horrible customer service provided by the manager michelle at the Gilbert location at crossroads.. i ended up going accross the street to Shoe Carnival and bought 4 pairs of shoes.. Btw, the managers name was Michelle...",negative
"I haven't been able to find a pair of black heels for a very long time. Within 10 minutes of walking into the store, I immediately found what I was looking for. Not only it is pretty, it is also comfy. I can't wait to break it in. Shoe boxes were definitely well organized. I could find different shoe sizes in different color easily. The lady who worked here last night was very friendly (at first). However, this is where the store started to lose my 5 star. First of all, the credit card machine is incredibly slow at reacting, but very quick to kick you out if you don't hit the button fast enough. It was very frustrating. Secondly, the lady told us that if we paid money towards charity, we would get an additional 15% discount. While I was waiting for the machine to react, I actually found the 15% discount coupon on my phone app. It took the machine another few minutes to react to this change and redo the whole thing again. After everything was said and done, she still guilt trip me by saying ""are you sure you don't want to donate money to help out the children? "" Have U guys seen the recent south park show when the cashier tried to shame the customer at the whole food store? That was how she made me feel. When it was my friends turned to pay, I simply walked out from the store waiting for him. Especially when i pulled up the 15% coupon for his separate purchase from the website, and she refused to use it saying that the machine probably wouldn't take it. Then, she pressure him to give donation just like she did to me in order to get his 15% discount (when I had a coupon for him too & it is advertise on their website and yelp app. I didn't feel like arguing with her non sense and left. The entire check out process took about 10 minutes. I was not happy at that point. Nevertheless, I'm glad to walk out with a pair of shoes that I like...and if I come back next time, I will probably bring cash.",negative
I walked into this store and there were 2 other women who walked in before me. They got greeted and helped. I was 2 rows away. I walked to the seat to try on a pair of shoes as I was tying the shoes I WAS going to purchase well the sale associates a young man and young lady stood there talking. I never once was ask can I help you...I'm in plain view. I walked around still haven't been greeted. He walked right by me he actually looked in my direction. I wanted a pair of tennis shoes but since I wasn't acknowledged. I put my shoes back and heading for the door. A lady walked in and got greeted...REALLY? I suggest you retrain your sale associates in customer service. I really don't like playing the racist card. But I am a African American all the other customers that were greeted were Caucasian....They may not been aware of what happened and how it looked...but not a good look for your establishment. I was a customer but for now on I will purchase my shoes at some other Famous Footwear,negative
"Pretty disappointed at this place the girl who was working there was pretty rude and has lots of attitude, her name was Brie I believe. Was NOT helpful at all...not a friendly face, lots of attitude!! I think she realized how rude she was at the end of my visit so she managed to fake a smile and say have a good day. But I left without buying because she was just rude! I would put negative stars but there's no such option.",negative
"this company in general is really bad. my family has purchased several pairs of higher end sneakers here, our jobs make us go through pairs really fast, but after this past experience we will never go back. I purchased a pair that were defective, I went to exchange them they didn't have the size so they ordered them to come to the store within one week...which turned into a MONTH no shoes no money back customer service wouldn't send me a email to confirm return of money, they refused, finally I got the check it was sent to the STORE where I had to make a special trip to pick it up... very frustrated I do NOT recommend this company.",negative
"Fine Points is far more than a yarn/clothing/jewelry boutique with the best selection of EVERYTHING at competitive prices! Liz Tekus the owner is one of the nicest, kindest, most helpful people on planet earth! Over the years we have become friends and when I had cancer two years ago she was genuinely concerned and presented me with a beautiful bracelet. Just last week I was at the OBX and realized I had forgotten my pattern book and I called her and she emailed me the directions in 10 minutes! Liz and all the people working at Fine Points are incredible knitters and fiber artists and so generous with their time to help you learn anything you need to know. I have gone there with chunks of my hair torn out in frustration and they have straightened out my issues and sent me on my way! The last thing I have to say is that if you need inspiration for a project...just stop by the shop because Liz has tons of items made up that you can hardly decide what to make next! I should mention that I have a Masters degree in Fiber/Weaving from Tyler School of Art in Philadelphia and have been to more than my fair share of yarn stores over the last 45 years to compare this shop to!",positive
Warm setting and atmosphere. Amazing selection of yarns that are unique. Perfect for serious knitters as well as beginners. You can also find other boutique items there. A great spot in he Cleveland area to shop and dine.,positive
"Fine Points was one of the first places I knew in Cleveland Hts, and from the beginning, it has helped me make my home in this area. The quality of yarn is terrific, and there are always knitted goods hanging up inside, stimulating creativity and fun. I have also bought a third of my wardrobe from the clothing boutique upstairs. At this point, Heather, who helps manage the boutique, knows my body shape and size and makes the best recommendations--it's almost as if she buys for me! Yet generally speaking, I have always been treated well by the witty, creative, and warm women who work in this store. My knitting has grown a lot in the past few years because they are always willing to help me learn a new technique, or solve a strange problem in a pattern. In fact, with a very badly written pattern, by the time I got advice, at least five women in the store had tried to figure it out! I love how full of character and personality that green house of a store is, especially during a long, gray Cleveland winter. I often come when I need to get away from work or the blues, and it's like entering a different world. Yes, things may feel pricey, but I tell myself that I am investing in quality, creativity, care, and community. This is for knitting, clothing, and good company. This ain't no fast-food kind of place. Good things take time, and it's especially worth it when local. Many friends from out of town have been taken to Fine Points, and they always remark on how well treated we are.",positive
"Wall to wall yarn, but cluttered and dark. While there is a reasonable selection of yarns, nothing is priced. It's uncomfortable to keep asking the price of each yarn that I would consider for a project. After asking the price of 4 yarns, I finally left empty handed. If they did a little dusting, organizing and pricing ... This yarn store could be worth the trip.",negative
"Fantastic (and I mean FANTASTIC) selection of brand/colors. But the store comes across as snobbish, and there are no prices marked anywhere. You have to take your purchases to a clerk and have them look up the prices on everything. Not the way I want to browse. Also, the place is so stuffed full that you cannot turn around or touch anything without mounds of yarn cascading to the floor. I also had a gift card, and the clerk ringing me out spent 10 minutes trying to get it to work and still couldn't.",negative
"I would be giving this store 5 stars, but I felt like the woman running it were knitting snobs and not very eager to help us. It almost got 5 stars because it is WALL TO WALL yarn. Amazing yarn. Any yarn that I would be looking for is in this place and I picked up some really unique looking stuff and I wish I had some projects specifically in mind so I could've bought more!!!",positive
"Raven and the 2 men working tonight need to get a new job. 1. When I ask which adidas shoes are for running ""whichever are comfortable is ok"" Raven is not an appropriate answer. 2. I don't want to hear about it being almost closing time blah blah blah. If there were my employees I would fire them ASAP. 3. The said hi, clearly I wanted to hug a few pairs of shoes I asked for these adidas Sandles in a man's size WHY DOES RAVEN NOT KNOW HOW TO CONVERT WOMENs size to men's shoe size ? She tried her hardest to discourage a sale tonight so I as a business owner and the owner of a non profit would advise you to fire this lot who worked on Tuesday night and only cared about going home and closing shop. Never will I spend an ounce of my money there. I'm disgusted by the lack of service or care and lack of knowledge. No wonder this place has 2 stars.",negative
"The staff seemed unmotivated and I had to walk around with a display shoe to get somebody to retrieve my size. The store is run by unmotivated millenials. Of course, they didn't have my shoe size. I had to order my size at the counter but could barely hear myself speak because the mumble rap is played so loudly. I was told that my shoes would take 3-5 business days to arrive and that I would be contacted. After day 6, I called the 800 number and discovered my shoes were delivered within 2 days but nobody called me. When I returned to the store to pick up my brand new shoes, I saw that they were used.",negative
"The customer service was terrible at this location. We walked in and there were 5 workers who didn't say anything to us. I was waiting at the shoe wall to be helped. Finally, I asked the guy closest to me for a shoe. He turned to the other two male workers and said hey can you get this size? Both of the guys didn't seem to want to help us at all and it was like we were inconveniencing them. One of the guys was messing around on his cell phone which I find to be extremely poor customer service. At this point I was so annoyed and we decided to do our business elsewhere.",negative
I came to downtown Summerlin footlocker and Luis and Galyn did their absolute best to help me get the right exchange for my shoe !!,positive
Nice ambience in store. Very good selection. Knocked down in stars because they wouldn't honor the lower price for the same item advertised at Finish Line. Right! I always like paying Foot Locker's inflated prices for already overpriced shoes. Finish Line here I come.,negative
"Took my son last night to purchase shoes. It was Black Thursday, and there were at least a dozen employees working. However these employees were too busy chatting and shooting trash into the garbage can to bother greeting or actually assisting. After ten minutes I left with zero help and went to the vans store where the service was amazing and I purchased three pairs of shoes. Foot locker has terrible associates who do not want to help anyone and are not concerned with selling anything. I will never return to this store again.",negative
This place is a piece of shit I will never give my money to them EVER!! I ordered some lebron James soldier 10 shoes for my son directly at the store and I was told that in 3-5 business days I would receive them.. no word no phone call from the store at all. I finally called the store to see wats up and they told me they canceled my order. I said why? They said oh that shoe is on backorder!! R u fukn kidding me? U couldn't call and tell me ? Worst customer service!! Then I call the corporate office and no one gives a shit . No help! Nothin! Never order from these assholes again!,negative
"I purchased shoes online that did not work out. According to the online policy I could return them to a local store. When I brought them into the store, they said they needed to verify my credit card number with the online store before they could refund. They were on hold to speak to someone about this for about 1/2 an hour. It does not make sense to me to have someone wait for 1/2 an hour to verify a CC number. The last four did not appear anywhere on the receipt both electronic and hard copy receipt. My name, address and phone number was on the receipt which I had my ID to verify. I really do not see why it matters to them how they refund the money as I do not go through this with other stores. I really feel they should change how they proceed. Too much of a hassle to shop there anymore.",negative
They get 1 star just because of the decent selection. The customer service was terrible. The woman assisting us seemed like she didn't want to be bothered and had an attitude problem. She didn't even try to help us.,negative
Selection is awesome but the customer service on other hand was horrible I try to flag down to employees and they just sped off then I verbally asked employee if I can get a size they told me give me a couple minutes which I understand so after 10 minutes I asked for them employee and I was told that they clocked out and they left for the day. Which was a bummer because I actually sat there and waited for them,negative
"Embarrassed money was spent here . Upon arrival I watch guests be greeted by a pair of associates attached at the hip who couldn't put away a healthy convo to fully crowd control or build any real warm welcomes. Finally in a crowded store with plenty of payroll used I found my self wandering the store for a mirror to try on apparel and to my dismay none and none of that American customer service of five point guest augmentation. As a friend begged left and right for service or even to get full eye contact to grab a size,the ten plus sales staff seem to be no where in sight. Can this be Loss Prevention approved? Finally the shoe came out an asian dude who just could have cared less who had no product knowledge or passion could careless to make the sell stood there making one think am I bothering you? My bad!! I watched a store with ten people scurry around like ants but no leader to be found to give any direction. This is LV ! High volume your brand and demographic are here,so why is your customer service that of some Santa Ana factory outlet store? Come on guys!!!",negative
Good looking store but I believe the manager needs to be fired. I came in looking for a pair of Jordan shoes for my boyfriend. Inquired and asked questions. But I was ignored. He seemed to be getting some free things from some guys and had saved shoes for them. I thought this was unfair asked for the manger and he said he was it. I was told the hard to get shoes were either raffled and then first come first serve. I guess this doesn't apply to guys giving him things. I think this store is ran unethical and he is getting kickbacks for hard to get shoes. At least that is what I observed.,negative
Customer service is not good. Am I invisible? Watched at least 4 employees completely ignore me as I looked at shoes. Even sat down and waited patiently for someone to help me. Gave up- walked out- and as I was walking out someone asked if I needed something.,negative
"This Footlocker by far, surpasses my expectations in customer service and selection. Tyler, who seems to be the current store manager, is EXTREMELY helpful, and funny! He was able to locate and ship the Kobe VI Rice to my boyfriend when they weren't available in store! He even let us in an hour early when the Kobe VI Chaos (Jokers) came out! Not only Tyler is friendly, but there's also an older Asian man that works at this location.I couldn't get close enough to read a name tag, or if he even has a name on his badge, but it surprises me every time I see him, he is always assisting a customer, and he's not afraid to drop some younger slang in there. (Example: ""How' bout these Kobe's. These just dropped yesterday! They're clean!"") Haha, couldn't get over it, seeing as he has a very slight accent as well. Anyway, this is the spot to hit, especially since NikeTown at the Forum Shops in Caeser's Palace is closed for renovations until May! They get all the new releases, in VERY LIMITED amounts. Tyler isn't scared to let you know way ahead of time of drop dates, too. So props to him, and this particular location.",positive
"Probably the best stocked Foot Locker in Vegas, but can be a pain getting to since it's on the Strip and a big mall to walk around. Helpful salespeople and no problems with returns and exchanges.",positive
the cashier leah was extremely rude and has a horrible personality. will not returning to this location. made us feel unwanted and was extremely unhelpful. i had an exchange and the tag was ripped as she then accused me of wearing it and would not exchange it. very disappointed. horrible experience.,negative
I've been in much smaller Forever 21 stores that had at least a limited plus size selection. Absolute failure on the part of both management and corporate. Was ready to spend several hundred dollars on clothes this evening - Forever 21 did not just lose my business for this particular visit. I won't be visiting any of their stores in the near future.,negative
The store is well cleaned and very organized but the staff here is extremely rude. They don't welcome or ask if you need any help. They act like it's an inconvenience when you come in trying to spend money. I would recommend going to fashion squares forever 21 since they have better staff.,negative
Terrible customer service at this location. Very rude. Will not be back. Was very snotty about a return and there was nothing wrong with item. Never worn and still had tags on it. Just purchased it two weeks ago.,negative
"After coming to this store on multiple occasions, I will not be returning. It's basically like no one works here unless you want to pay or get a dressing room. Today there were only 2 girls actually working and the remainder of them were standing in a group talking not even bothering to look at the customers let alone ask them if they need help. During the last trip I took here I had to try on something and while my mother was waiting, she and the rest of us customers in the dressing rooms listened to two employees complain over their job and other coworkers and then actually started arguing and cussing at each other. I do believe my mother wrote a formal complaint on the Forever21 website after this happened, but it looks like nothing has really changed.",negative
I bought jewelry here on several occasions and both times it broke before I could even wear it. All of their jewelry is final sale so plan on having all the rhinestones Fallout and pearls break away before you can even wear anything. I went to return but I didn't have a receipt and they wouldn't take it or exchange it one day later.,negative
Clean and well maintained store. I've been here several times and never have I been asked if I needed help or greeted. The employees just walk around acting like customers are invisible. Twice I've needed help but didn't either bother asking for help since up at the register I always see the employees chatting away.,negative
"This place has gone down hill, the store is so cluttered you can't even go through the clothes! The employees are rude, like you owe THEM something. Sorry, jobs not that hard.",negative
"I was blessed with 5 girls but absolutely HATE shopping with them especially at this store. It is the most unorganized disaster. Just thinking about it makes me dizzy. Why in AZ did we vote to pay these kids $15 an hour? They are not helpful, they stand around and talk like it's a social hour and the store is a mess. It's like walking into a teenagers bedroom that hasn't been cleaned for a year. Never the the less we finally found dresses for a wedding. I will be sticking to online shopping from now on or just sending the girls with my credit card. P.S. I set a timer and told the girls they have ONE hour, after that I'm leaving. The one star is for the crappy folding chairs by the dressing room you can sit in until you are finally ready to leave and pay for over priced clothes.",negative
"This store has the worst customer service I have ever received. I gave it a one star for lack of a zero. I came in because after washing 2 blouses for my 15 year old daughter and following the instructions, they shrank at least a size smaller. All I asked of their very rude manager, Robert was for an exchange to a larger size or a gift card. He however, wouldn't hear of it...all he said was that he couldn't help me because the shirts had been washed and tags removed. HELLO? Where is this logic? Of course they were washed, how else did I find out that they had shrank. I would have dropped the issue, but I thought it was so unfair to be treated this way. I'm out of $45 dollars and unfortunately, my daughter really loved the shirts. I called their customer service in a foreign country and was even more frustrated when even after speaking to a supervisor, they refused to offer me a resolution. Keep in mind, I have a receipt and they were just purchased 2 weeks ago. I will never give this store my money, their prices are much higher than I remembered and the quality of their clothes, well, what can I say. BUYER BEWARE!!!!!",negative
"Employees walk right by you and give you the stank look. No greetings, no welcome in. The racks are so FULL you can't even browse through the merchandise. There is more clothes and accessories on the ground then there is hung.. The fitting rooms are always crowded and the people tending them are always in a bad mood. Oh do be careful when walking! There are loose tiles everywhere, so shoes tend to get stuck in them every so often! This store has potential but not with the people that work here. Maybe also with some new tiles?... And some smiles?... Customer service 101..",negative
"My 17 year old daughter and I walked into this location yesterday around 4 pm. There were THREE employees standing directly at the door, talking. Not ONE bothered to greet us as we entered the store. So, we just walked through and out the other door to another store. Oh, and they REALLY need to do something about that cheap flooring. The pieces lift in various locations throughout the store. I've tripped and stubbed my toe during previous shopping visits. Yesterday I noticed they'd finally used tacky, yellow Forever 21 tape to try and hold them down. Very nice. I'm not sure what's worse the dangerous flooring, or the rude employees.",negative
"Lots of great clothes. We went in for my daughter, and I ended up getting a few things - belts. Definitely any not long dresses or skirts are way too short for a woman in her 40s. But, some really cute clothes and great prices. I would tend more towards some of the conservative stuff, but they seem to have a large selection of clothes, plenty of dressing rooms, and a great variety of things at reasonable prices. This was my first time going in. Nice staff, too and not bothersome.",positive
"This Forever 21 is better in every way then the Chandler location in the mall. Both locations have good selection for women, but this location excels is customer service. Everyone here is very friendly when at the Chandler location everyone is miserable and acts inconvenienced when you ask for help. The parking is close. You can actually get cell phone service in this location where Chandler you can't. Clothes are pretty cheaply made, but you already know that if you have shopped here before. You get what you pay for.",positive
"Love this place! It's so organized, easy to shop! They would put a bowl of accessories to match your outfit in the same area.",positive
"I came into this store after work on a Tuesday evening and was not greeted as I walked in, there was only one other customer in the store. I browsed majority of the racks without a peep from any of the sales associates. I even helped myself into the dressing room, I walked out empty handed and was horrified at how bad the customer service is here. This was not my first experience!",negative
"Went there on a Monday morning. They had just opened and I was the only customer in the store. I was returning a new, unopened item while I attempted to ask the clerk about their return policy when she answered the phone and signaled to me to hold on a moment (while she takes care of the person on the line-- which turned out to be a stock check for a garment.) When the clerk came back from the stockroom I began asking her once more to explain the return policy when she answered the phone AGAIN! I was beside myself! HOW RUDE! Please take care of customers who are in front of you first and foremost, phone calls can be put on hold, or ignored until you're free. Second complaint is that there return policy is of the worst. I had the receipt for the item -- it was purchased at $28 plus tax but since it was bought over 21 days prior (purchased 30 days ago) I was only able to get a store credit for $11, which was the current sale price + tax. Unbelievable horrible customer service at this establishment. Not to mention all the jewelry and handbags I have purchased there have fallen part. No thank you Francesca's you have lost a customer-- and I have 4 daughters, none of them will be patronizing your stores any longer, either.",negative
"Francesca's is a women's clothing shop that continues to grow on me. The nice thing about this store is it also serves as a gift shop. They offer a variety of fun mugs, plaques, t-shirts, and other novelty gifts, as well as clothing, fashion purses, and jewelry. Today I was shopping for a gift and ended up finding 3 awesome tops for a great price (buy one get one 50% off), which seems to be their standard sale. They also have some great clearance racks. What occurred to me today is how pleasant the staff is. Every time I have been inside their stores, the staff has been especially friendly and helpful! These stores are located in various states and malls. However, today I was shopping at the Chandler Fashion Center and wanted to say thanks to the Manager and Assistant Manager-Thank you for making my shopping experience so pleasurable today! They even picked out some things for me to try based on my selections! Thanks again-you two deserve a raise!!!",positive
I love Francesca's but not this location. I was in there earlier today and I was treated so rudely by the staff. I bumped their overly stocked table and got ridiculed for knocking over some books. Nothing broke and it was a total accident. But the staff there were so rude and treated me poorly.,negative
"Based off the previous reviews this store has really turned it around. The store is under new management it appears and everyone who has helped me has always been great, even getting on a ladder to get the picture I wanted. I would defiantly give this location another chance if you've had a bad experience.",positive
"This store has gone downhill the past year :/ Two ladies last night were sitting at the register chatting away as a friend and I walked in. It wasn't even slow, I would guess about 7 other people were in the store as well. Things were not tidy the way they should be... I was looking for a pair of shoes that they had on display with no luck. The ladies were too busy chatting to ask if I needed help and I thought meh, I don't need another pair of overpriced wedges and left.",negative
I love Francescas style but had a horrible experience in the store today. I ordered a bunch of clothes online and all of it was way too big. When trying to return clothes at the store... they tried to con me into storw credit. Stating the policy was 2 weeks to return. I had to go online and read the policy... horrible customer aervice. But I got my money back,negative
"I love Francesca's and there cute clothing BUT I am not a fan of the customer service at this location. I've been to many different Francesca's, Oregon, California, and here. And this is the 1st location I had a bad experience. I've been to this location many times, and have yet to encounter a nice welcoming person. When I was in last night, I was the only person in the store and was not even acknowledged once. The girls were to busy gossiping to be bothered with a customer. I found a dress that I really liked, but decided not to buy the dress because of how unfriendly the girls were. I can go to the location off Ray road, buy my dress and have a much better experience.",negative
"Today my friends and I decided to go shopping today to treat ourselves and we landed in this cute store! We met the cutest short haired blonde girl who was do much fun, she was so personable unlike everyone in all of the other stores at the mall who say hi quietly and walk away! She was just the cutest girl ever and I will never forget that store because she made it memorable!",positive
"Anytime I enter this shop I want to buy the whole lot up! It's the first place I go to for work outfits. They offer fun, youthful, and still classy options that you can't find at other places. The prices are pretty affordable. The shop itself is very relaxing and I feel very comfortable here.",positive
I've been to the Francesca's on Ray before and loved it. Now I'm thrilled there's one even closer to me located inside Chandler Fashion Center. It's just as cute and funky and it was crowded with happy shoppers when I stopped in today. The staff was cheerful and personable as they helped out their customers from everything from sandals to belts to dresses. Francesca's is reminiscent of ANTHROPOLOGIE in Scottsdale but with much friendlier price tags. Will be stopping by this store every time I'm in the mall to keep finding adorable accessories and gifts. :D,positive
"I love Freshly Baked Tees! I've been coming here for several years to print shirts with memes I photoshop to include my brother's face. It's always a quick and easy process, and the service is great. $30-$40 for one shirt is on the steep side, but it's worth it for the quality of the tee and print plus the convenience of the on-the-spot job. Lucas helped me out this week and he was awesome.",positive
I purchased 2 tees. Originally I wasn't satisfied with the results. Joe the owner reached out to me and solve the issue to my satisfaction. I believe this level of attentiveness deserve a 5 star rating. Keep up the good work! Helpers don't be afraid to communicate your concerns with this business. They're open to it :),positive
"I had a less than impressive experience at the Queen Street store, and the owner heard about it, reached out, has been jumping through hoops to make it right. Impressive and unexpected!",positive
Best customer service ever! They were super understanding of when I needed my order and really helpful when it came to the design. I would definitely come back here!,positive
I love this place except one white girl who has a bad attitude . Every body there is very nice and respectful I will find out her name next time when I write a review,positive
"I recently had the need to print some shirts for a trip and found the service provided by Niall to be excellent. I had never printed shirts before and it was very simple, I walked in, emailed a picture I had made and they were able to tweak it to look great and print it right away. I was in and out in under 15 minutes. Highly recommended.",positive
Conveniently close to parking on Augusta. I simply emailed my design and they had it up quickly on a screen I could see easily. Super knowledgeable staff and fast service. The showroom had a great selection of samples and I will be using them again for future events.,positive
"Needed a whole bunch of t shirts printed last minute and I could honestly not have been happier with the service. Fast friendly and efficient! Kyle who works there is amazing and professional, seriously epic experience at this place. Highly recommend it!",positive
"In need of multiple shirts with varying graphics and sizes, I thought I had a complicated mess on my hands. However, Kyle at the Queen location made the experience a breeze. The process was painless and the shirts turned out really well! Customer for life!",positive
Just got two items printed here. Service was really fast and friendly. Naile took the time to make sure the images were exactly the way I wanted. Very reasonably priced too!,positive
Got a tshirt made at the last minute for a Christmas party by Niall. He helped with the design and had it finished in 5 minutes. Great quality tshirt as well.,positive
"Just had a special t-shirt made for my niece for the holidays. Kyle and Jordan helped me in flushing out my idea, and they made it even better! They worked great as a team to get the design and printing done. The final result is better than I had imagined. Super happy!",positive
"Went to buy a special custom tee for my cousin and was helped by Niall - couldn't be happier with his customer service and the quality of the work! The black t-shirt they supply is a nice quality and the white printing looks great. FYI, you can bring your own t-shirt if you want. (I went up a size as it fits a bit small.) The service is very very quick too!I wasn't alone in my positive experience - the other customers around me were really pleased with both the quality and timing! Thank you Freshly Baked Tees!",positive
"Very convenient tshirt printing! I uploaded my design online the day before and they printed it when I went in the next day. The printing took less than 5 minutes. The customer service was great! The person working was very welcoming. One tshirt cost 33 dollars, which I think is a fair price (on the lower average) for a custom shirt. The shirt looked great!!! I will definitely go back if I need a custom shirt again.",positive
"Awesome spot! Quick, efficient, professional and helpful staff. Always nice when people are able to think and offer and alternative, instead of deeming an issue unsolvable. Keep up the good work!",positive
The place is stellar. I walked in a few weeks back with a very vague idea of what I wanted and Grant(I'm pretty sure that's his name) was awesome. I needed a couple custom T's for a short film shoot and he well exceeded my expectations. He actually made the process fun and collaborative. Much appreciated.,positive
"I've been using these guys for many years for my staff uniforms and baseball team uniforms. Always a quick turn around, excellent customer service and great pricing. I highly recommend them, Thanks Guys!",positive
"I don't usually get screen printed shirts. But after seeing them on yelp I had to check them out. It's actually really cool, you design online, then you come in to pick it up. Can virtually make anything you want-- ummmmm yeaaaa! Amazing.",positive
"Price was good, service was professional, quality is outstanding. These guys are connected to the guys at Toronto T's. I could not be happier with both of their services, I use them regularly and would not hesitate to recommend them.",positive
"The shirts they make look great but are poor quality...I had a shirt made and hand washed it separately, then put it in the dryer right away as the staff recommended, and I took out the dry shirt to find the ink had bled from the design onto the white shirt..it's not like the shirt was totally ruined but from a distance it looks like it has dirt on it because of the ink smears.",negative

"Let's be honest, I'll still go here because it's close, but it is no longer my go to spot. It's expensive, except the weekly deals of course, the produce is terrible and it takes FOREVER to check out. Convenience is key here.",negative
Giant Eagle is the place to get everything you need. The variety is wonderful. Produce is fresh. My only complaint is the line. I can't ever seem to get out of there because they aren't well staffed. I always go to the automated registers to check out!,positive
I'm a native Pittsburgher but something is wrong with this location. Can't use self check if you don't have your Giant Eagle card handy. Always short staff checkouts so bad choice. Clerks are rude and just doing their job as lamely as possible. Questions or comments met with a heavy sigh. Millions spent on disastrous ill-lit sections. S*** flows downhill so it's bad management. Has to be on corporate radar because other locations much better. You can find me at Heinens right up the street.,negative
"Had a issue with a birthday cake. They made it right by remaking the cake. Also for having to wait, it was on the house",positive
"Love Giant Eagle cakes...but I moved to an area where there are no Giant Eagles to be found. Luckily, my grandparents live near this one. We ordered the almond cake for my mom's birthday with the intent that they would pick it up and bring it to Toledo. I called 4 days before and placed my order. Grandparents get there...only to be told they couldn't find the cake. They called the Chagrin and Solon stores to check that I hadn't called the wrong store, and then pulled a cake out of the freezer and got it ready for my grandparents. It wasn't until they were walking to check out did they find the cake...under the wrong name! But they were extremely accommodating to my grandparents and the cake was delicious. Also, the remodel made the store awesome. I can't imagine it not having something you need.",positive
"I stopped by yesterday evening, and found a couple small items. I went to go checkout, and when I showed her my 20% off coupon, the cashier wouldn't accept it because it was an Oct one.. so its the 2nd of Nov!.. usually those emails don't come through in time, and every other location, including this one will grant you the grace period. Considering the entire business is IN BUSINESS bc of our local donations. After I stood there for what felt like 10 mins to reload my email on my phone, I was able to pull up the updated one, I showed her. The cashier then tells me how she'll be sure to tell corporate that other locations allow the 5 day window for the coupon use. Talk about bad customer service..I understand if this was a coupon from a few months ago.. but they are the same coupons EVERY MONTH..diff barcode (so what) they don't scan it..they punch in a code. Any who, she made it a point to be shitty, and decent customer service is hard to find.. this was a shining example.",negative
"Smelled like someone did something in there pants in this one. Shooting up Meth up front! I mean, I know it's goodwill and I was not expecting much, but I had some higher standards. Go if you want to catch something!",negative
"Definitely would suggest a different goodwill, because first of all the cashiers got attitude. Although the clothes are trendy and priced quit reasonably some happen to be to pricy for the quality of the item. So I'm going to leave it at this goodwill needs a new staff asap and lower prices. Also I'm not going to goodwill to get Walmart prices I'm going to goodwill to snatch a spicy deal and some good quality hand me downs. Plus the staffs attitude of I do say again is so crazy. One time I was pushed by a worker while looking for a water bottle, because apparently there wasn't enough room in the area for the worker to move without making a confrontation.",negative
"this location is kept clean and organized, which makes things easy to find when in a hurry like i happened to be in today. one of the staff members seemed a little irked by the fact that i accidentally let the dressing room door close behind me on my way out, and seemed a bit confused when i asked him if i could leave few items of the clothes that i had decided not to buy with him because he was standing right next to the rack used for items going back out onto the floor. i didn't think much of that interaction because the clerk at the checkout counter was more than respectful. every item with a green tag on it happened to be on sale for a dollar so that was a pleasant surprise. i went inside to buy a pair jeans and i came outside with a bracelet, a jacket, a pair of jeans, a shirt and a poncho. goodwill always has been and always will be my favorite store in the universe!",positive
"This is the Goodwill store that used to be around the corner in the same shopping mall but with the McClintock address. I believe it moved about a year ago to this location which is a larger store. I've actually had pretty good luck at this Goodwill recently. I've been here on previous trips and have come in 3 or 4 different times this trip. I always find some things that I can use or that I like. It's not the closest one to me but if I feel like driving that direction then I will stop by, especially on the 50 percent off Saturdays. One bonus is it is next to a Sprouts Market, the Arizona Art Supply store, and across the street from the Coldstone Ice Cream. This last time I was in here I stopped into the Outback restaurant for lunch, a place that I had never been to before. The store seems to be clean and organized, as much as it can be with all the people that go through messing it up. The prices are not too bad, though all the Goodwills are not as reasonable as they used to be. But on the half price Saturdays every other week you can really do well.",positive
Went to the store on S. Eastern and Serene on 6/17/2018 with lots of T shirts and collared shirts. Help the people out. The lady at the desk hates her job and is a miserable person. Did not make eye contact. Did a little paper receipt for the items donated. Do these people care about helping people or just being miserable. I am going to find another charity to help next time. Shame no thank you or appreciate what you brought to the center. Shame on this place.,negative
This was by far the worst experience I've had ever they wouldn't take my money even though it was legit because they didn't accept older style hundreds even though it was real and their customer service was craps their selection with crap and they were rude and couldn't even explain to me why my money wasn't good any good there,negative
"Used to find clothes at a good price, and clothes were in good shape. Last few times I shopped there, clothes were in very bad shape. Many were ripped or dirty. I can understand wear from people trying them on, but what I saw were holes in clothes, and filth, like stains or dried on food. You would think that since they get everything for free, they would pay someone to look over clothes before they put on racks. Seems like they put everything they take in on the racks without checking them out.",negative
"Now....I must say, there are times where I find some GREAT stuff here. But, ever since the Bankruptcy filing of Goodwill.....it's like....WHAT HAPPENED???? First, how does a business who runs on donations, and not have to pay for any inventory....have to file Bankruptcy? Sounds like mismanagement, and some overspending of funds finally caught up to them here. Because only NV Goodwill has filed BK. Now prices. Since filing, they have been so gracious as to overprice about 99% of their items. There is no longer any way of telling if something is on sale or not, and staff look like they are in forced labor.....sad faces, no one speaks, sometimes I walk by and pass gas just to see if I can get them to react.... :) Lastly, attempts to alter prices on priced merchandise. My last visit to Goodwill about 3 weeks ago this occurred. Upon check out, the clerk attempted to INCREASE PRICES AT THE REGISTER!!! CAN YOU SAY ILLEGAL!!!!!!! Luckily, a manager was smart enough to understand me when I told her how illegal that was....interesting because this is also a slick way for people to steal by removing extra money out registers. I don't know the future of Goodwill here in NV, but they can start by firing everybody, and bringing in some people with honor, and integrity.",negative
"Rude and very unorganized... I wanted to use the fitting room so I went in and the door I tried was locked, nobody in it. So I went to find an associate and the one I found told me that they are unlocked and if they were locked someone was obviously in it. Then proceeded to giggle to another associate about it. So I went back, luckily someone was walking out so I got a room. I also had a very hard time figuring out where one size started and the other ended. There were maybe 3 size rings that I saw. Clothes all over the floor and just overall the reason Goodwill gets a bad name. Hate to leave a bad review being that I absolutely love going to Goodwill stores..",negative
Over price Everything !! Used Bras almost ten dollars !! Extremely Over price Big Disappointment because for those prices you can already pay for unworn Clothing,negative
I'm not a thrift shopper but my friend is. I went with her just to glance around. They really need to dust this store my allergies were going crazy from all the mothballs! Goodwill is not dirt cheap like it used to be. A lot of the items are overpriced. Why pay 7.99 for a uses shirt when you can get a brand new shirt for the same price? I refuse to pay for overpriced used clothes. I only bought some dvds here. The rest of the items are NOT my style! Oh yeah they also had a used dresser for 400 bucks lol. Goodwill is suppose to help the community not see what they can get from poor people.,negative
I am a VIP Goodwill Shopper. The customer service was good. Merri (Cashier) and Antonio (Manager) was very helpful. The store layout was different than I am accustom to being a goodwill shopper. They had fairly decent inventory available for women. I found duplicates of some items which was very helpful. They were all new with tags. The mens inventory was not so great. They were restocking the store during my visit. A few racks were empty.,positive
very very over priced. so many things cost more than i could purchase the item new. who determines the prices in these stores. no chance of me ever shopping there again.,negative
"I've made a few visits to this location this month for some Halloween odds and ends for costumes. I just have to say my visit yesterday was the worst. Not only was the store pretty messy, but the line to check out was absurd. Four people on the floor were stocking shelves and three were behind the register with only ONE ringing guests out. In my 15 minutes waiting in line, I heard the manager being called 4 times and no one ever came. Another manager or shift leader finally came asked one question to the person actually working, then walked outside and never came back in. I was appalled, I am a manager myself and if there is ever a line of customers that extends halfway through your store, take note and jump on a register. I will never go back to this location due to the managements inability to perform at a manager level.",negative
"I have donated a lot of items to Goodwill over the years..I believe in helping people wherever that might be. There have been some really nice people that work for the company, that being said there are some that need to find another place to be. I dropped off a stroller to the goodwill truck on Eastern and Horizon Ridge location the other day. I turned my back to get in my car and by the time I turned back around I saw the young man throw the stroller underneath the truck..I am not saying he sat it gently he threw it- probably broke it. I told him I did not appreciate it him doing that. He just looked at me like I was stupid. I will probably find other places to donate to in the future. If he hates his job that much he needs to find something different to do.",negative
"Thrift shopping is always a hit or miss. The past two times I've been here I found really good clothes. I don't care for name brand things as long as it looks nice but I have scored name brands like Banana Republic and Loft. Rather pay less than $10 for a cute sweater or shirt than something $50+ haha. Today I went in twice today and both times the cashiers were slow. Do you not see people standing right in front of you? The second time I was waiting to be rung up, an employee greeted me-in hopes that he would ask if I was ready but he didn't. Apparently the computers were down but at least inform me. I'm pretty sure the cashier who ended up ringing me up saw me standing there too.",negative
"I use to frequent this place 2-3 times a week for over a 2 year span. I would spend hundreds of dollars every month on just random items that I couldn't leave behind. I absolutely used to love this place but then it all changed. The change came with the new management a few months ago. Whomever is running this place now should not be in the position they are in, they are absolutely clueless. The pricing is absolutely ridiculous, to the point where you can find the same item next door at 99 cent store for 1/3 of the price. Due to the extreme price hikes, traffic has died down and it's evident when you walk in and it looks like a junk yard. Nobody is buying and the junk just keeps piling. To make matters worse, theft appears to be rampant especially among the small boxed items. An item that use to cost a couple bucks is now 10 to 15 dollars and people are simply pocketing them (lots of empty boxes). Some items are priced so high that they sit on the shelf for months and day after day, the content is slowly looted. Do not waste your time here. Go to the Stephanie location which is about a 10 minute drive from here. It's more organized and the prices are normal. Dear corporate - Do yourselves a favor and replace the dimwits you call managers that are running this place into the ground.",negative
"Very disappointed! Just donated several $100's of items a few weeks ago following my move to the area. Over 40 large boxes of items. Called today to schedule another pick up only to be told unless I have large furniture items they can not do a home pick up. I told them I have 20+ moving boxes full of household items and picking up boxes wasn't a problem when they came a few weeks ago to pick up about 40 boxes. When I told them they did a pick up then, the girl answering the call just hung up on me! They will never get another item from me! I called Salvation Army and had no problem scheduling a pick up. That's where all my donations will be going from now on!",negative
"I've been thrifting quite a bit lately for my DIY wedding decor and anytime we're in a area and see a thrift shop, I have to stop in. While this location had a LOT of stuff. it also felt claustrophobic as the aisles are too narrow have more than 1 person in it and things are just everywhere. That's fine so long as there are deals, but I was just plain discouraged at the prices they wanted to pull for some stuff. I looked at vases and one of the simple single flower vases was $3.99. I bought the exact same ones at another thrift shop for 49 cents. What is even more ridiculous is these vases were originally from the Dollar Tree. I saw a few other vases that looked similar to what I have which were also $2-3 where the ones I bought were 99cents. I was looking for large vintage floral serving plates for the dessert table display. Most of these were $4-5 a piece. I just bought a few at another store for $1-2. I still browsed a few more knick knacks and after I found all were priced too high, I just stopped and left. It's other peoples junk that they got for free to sell.",negative
"A little pricier than other goodwils I have been to, but it's definitely a lot more organized than most. Not to mention it doesn't smell bad like a lot of thrift store do, it smells like apple airfresheners!",positive
"As far as Goodwill locations go, this store is pretty good. If you are looking for clothing, particularly denim jeans and t-shirts, this is one of the most well-stocked in Vegas. It's not great on the housewares, dresses or furniture so if you are looking for those things I would recommend one of the other Goodwill stores in town. The aisles are super tiny so don't get a cart unless absolutely necessary. The clothing racks are overstuffed with merchandise, making it difficult to browse or move the clothes hangers. This store in particular is very, very popular with the elderly: they'll be clogging the aisles shopping next to you and they like to donate all of their free casino crap t-shirts, drinking glasses and other random Station Casinos logo'ed ""trinkets of treasure"" here (guess it's better than giving them as X-mas gifts to the grandkids)! Check the sign when you come in because this location offers lots of sales and specials. The quality of stuff is what you'd expect at Goodwill (if you want items in nicer condition, check out Savers instead) and the prices are low. I've scored awesome vintage t-shirts in decent condition for 50 cents. Can't beat that, fellow hipsters!",negative
"The last time i came here on one of the days where they have those specials for different color tags i was super excited because i love thrift shopping & you would expect the prices to be super low after the discount they offered. I searched practically EVERY single rack and could not find a single thing with the color tag i was looking for. Its like they purposely hid them from the customers or something. Also the staff here are not the friendliest, i did not see one smile, and when one of the staff (i believed she might of been a manager) tried to squeeze by me i apologized for my cart in the way and she just rolled her eyes and said i need to get through. The aisles are super small and can barely fit 2 people in them. The only thing i found that i liked was a pair of moccasins in pretty good shape & there was two stickers on them, one cheaper then the other. When i went to checkout the woman at the register took the cheaper sticker off and charged me 7 dollars for a pair of shit shoes. Im sorry but i just don't recommend this place, not good selection for cute women's clothing & pretty pricey for a ""thrift store"" and the staff isn't very nice. You might as well drive to a different thrift store instead of wasting your time here.",negative
"This thrift store is pretty small, and very unorganized. I went to go find some inexpensive summer clothes for my little one and they don't organize the clothes by size or gender, so I was frustrated and ended up not buying anything. Lots of old used stuff priced higher than the $.99 store rights next door, too.",negative
"I'm not a fan of this particular Goodwill. It's on the smaller side and their selection wasn't the best or kept particularly organized or clean. The parking lot for this location is busy and it's often hard to find parking since there are so many different shops and restaurants in one small area. I also dislike the checkout line process, since there is no discernable order to checking out and the line can get a bit out of hand since no one can tell where the line starts and who is in front of whom.",negative
"Every time I've been here, it's been busy, which is unfortunate given how narrow the aisles are. If somebody is in one of the rows of clothes with a cart, you have to awkwardly squeeze past and hope you don't knock clothes off. There's little chance of passing someone if you both have carts. The store in general always seems crowded, slightly disorganized, and a little dingy. I don't think it's actually dirty; it just seems that way since the rows are so narrow and there's so many people and it feels a bit claustrophobic.",negative
"This is by far one of the better & bigger GW's in the valley. Their prices are more in line with Savers or Epic. -Not crazy or sizist (smells are more expensive than Larges, or vice-versa) like a few of the other Goodwill locations. They are pretty organized & their staff is friendly. I try to make a stop here whenever I'm even remotely near the area.",positive
"A friend recently sent me a great quote ""Taking back your ex is like buying your shit back from your own garage sale."" While I find this to be true, it doesn't have a lot to do with any of the Las Vegas Goodwill stores. Luckily, I love the Goodwill stores in Las Vegas because they have so much weird crap! Go whenever you can and look for the strange & unusual if you're into that. I once found an amazing 2 headed goat. The amount of creepy looking house-hold items at Las Vegas Goodwill stores is far above the national average.",positive
"After shopping at the 99 Cent Store in the same shopping center, we decided to stop in here to look around and see if we could find anything worthwhile. I was surprised when The Better Half called me over to the display case at the front of the store to show me a large marble carving....it was awesome and matched a set of lamps in our living room! Normally, we don't find items like this in a thrift store, but it was our lucky day I guess. The price for it? $10! We gladly paid for it and of course, I had to carry this thing out to the car. It was 30 lbs or so, but it was worth the effort. I'm glad we stopped by the 99 Cent Store that day otherwise we wouldn't have found this gem. Return Factor - 90%",positive
"I love to go thrift shopping from time to time but, my favorite thrift store (Savers) is too far away so, this (for the most part) is my only choice in the area. Especially since I go ""thrifting"" when I get my car washed next door. Goodwill is great for finding jeans for me to distress, cut-up, and dye. I tend to find good Levi's and kids jeans that fit me quite well. Recently went in looking for Halloween costumes. Almost found a Captain America fit but, it was a bit too small. Left with a cool denim and bubble vest. Almost left with an amazing orange and gold jacket but, it was too big for me. In general, ""thirfting"" has it's great vintage and unique finds. Prices are good and they even have special days/discounts. I got a discount on my pieces because I had a player's card.",positive
They have alot of clothes. They recently expanded the back to allow for more furniture. They have a decent selection of items but I think that their prices are sometimes way too high for a thrift store.,negative
"I've had a long standing love/hate relationship with goodwill - love it since I'm a hoarder, but its a for profit ""non profit"" that has a lot of balls to charge what they do for inventory they received free. They sell a lot of things from target and actually charge more than retail price, which is ridiculous. But it is what it is, and this review isn't specifically about the eastern location, but wherever goodwill of southern nv office is. I was moving so had a ridiculous pile of things for donation - way too much to drop off w out a truck. Submitted their ""preferred"" online form for a home pick up on a Wednesday. Didn't hear anything for a week, called the number listed for donations and it was ridiculous. The person said she didnt even have my form. Said they did pick ups for my zipcode only on Sundays. They will give you a few hours timeframe and you HAVE to be home or they wont take anything. I can only assume because some idiot has taken things in the past that weren't out for donation. They gave me the names of some other charities that supposedly do pick ups (couple of which I know for sure don't). I went with salvation army and they were awesome - quick, prompt and you can just leave it out for them.",negative
"It's a bigger Goodwill store than the one on Rainbow, but a little smaller than the one near Tropicana. Always has something interesting to buy -- be it weird Star Wars helmets, Nintendo 64 systems, or a giant popcorn maker in the shape of a penguin. Always an amusing way to spend a lunch hour.",negative
"This place is awesome. Gordy's has been there for my husband when he raced as a boy and is still up and running now that our son is racing. Gordy's does a fantastic job with the service and prices. It is a one of a kind place for BMX racers and supporters alike. I know some people like to complain about pricing, but they are the only shop in town, they know what you need if you need anything, and they will service it for you in house. Go support your local BMX shop and go to Gordy's!",positive
"Very helpful, originally came in to buy a 26"" bike. They helped me make a better decision, recommended other bike options and sizes like 24"" and 22"". I ended up buying a fitbikeco BF22 and I'm very happy with the recommendation from what I originally wanted. Everyone was very helpful and knowledgable. Ask for Gary he helped me all the way through making a better pick. Thanks",positive
This is an old school bike shop. The people are friendly and take time to get to know you. They aren't just after a sell. Quality people and items.,positive
"Brice met me as I entered the store asking how he may help me, a personable young man. I inquired regarding the price to replace front & rear brake pads on my mountain bike, and if I needed an appointment to do so. He quoted the price and said it could be done right then. The mechanic replaced the pads in a reasonable amount of time, and I was on the road again. The store appears to be equipped with a nice selection of bicycle accessories, tires, rims, and team clothing. I shall do repeat business with this shop. Thank you, Gordy's.",positive
"Just left Gordy's Bicycles with a new 16"" starter bike for my youngest boy and a sweet new Redline bike for me. Couldn't be happier with the service and selection they had and I am very glad I drove well out of my way to see these guys.",positive
"It was suggested by a very knowledgeable friend to come here even though it was well out of my way, both he and his brother had been coming here for years. Apparently the change in family management has turned this shop into a shop of indifference and suspect repairs...I had shopped around and noticed their service was more expensive when compared to others rt down the street and in the NW basin. I picked my bike up with zero smiles, zero thanks, and zero feedback on what to keep an eye on or what will need replacing etc in the future. That should have been the 2nd tipoff, price being the first. Once back in the saddle I felt like all I received was an wayyy overpriced bike wash. I have exactly the same gear change issues as before, along with other minor issues that should have been taken care of at that price. Blows my mind that with an opportunity to start a business relationship and create future sales opps this establishment completely dropped the ball. After reading some of the similar stories here I decided to not call and complain because obviously they dont care, I will just take my money elsewhere...goodbye, good luck n good riddance...",negative
Good old-fashioned elbow grease and customer service fix the problem another bike shop could not fix for literally $.54 awesome solution awesome price awesome service would definitely recommend this repair shop to a friend.,positive
Horrible horrible service and treated like a fool by punks at store. I purchased a new dirt bike for my son for Christmas. He doesn't go offroad but we have already spend more on tires and tunes than the bike cost. After my sons tire went bad I asked for new heavy duty tires and tubes. The service guy said he would be ready in two hours and when I came 5 hours later it was not done. The kid told me he was busy. Thanks for the call man. Then he proceeded to do a service in front of me for a guy who just walked in and made me wait. My sons new tire went flat as soon as I got home. Had to go back and was treated like a fool. They fixed it. It went flat the next day. My wife went in and they made her by a new tube. Are you kidding me. You botch the job and then say we don't know how to keep pressure in the tire. Your shop did it. Guy I manage a big boy automotive tire business I know how tires work. I will never shop with these lazy crooked punks again.,negative
"I'm a loyal customer! My kids and I showed up right when they were closing but they saw I had a flat and let us in, fixed us up and sent us on our way! Super nice family owned bike shop... I will never go anywhere else!",positive
"Great bike shop! I was looking for a specific tire made by Freedom Thickslicks. I asked if they carried the tire,they didn't carry in their normal assortment. The sales associate offered to order them for me and price match online too. Great service from a brick and mortar!",positive
"I went into Gordy's just to pick up an inner tube. The gentleman went out of his way to make sure the bike we brought in was the correct size for my son. He offered to changed out the inner tubes for $7.00 labor, which was a smoking deal. After i paid he then offered to adjust my sons seat. Wonderful service. We were just on our way back to Gordy's to look at helmets today.",positive
I am so thankful to RJ. He made it possible for me to buy the bike I have been wanting for so long (3yrs to be exact). I am so happy with my new trike. Dealing with balance issues this was really my only option if I wanted a bike but I couldn't afford it. Thank you so much guys for everything. It was a pleasure doing business with you.,positive
My son found an Aaron Ross bike online that he was obsessed with. Called Gordys to see if they could track one down. Turns out that specific model was not even out yet. I left my number and was thrilled they called to tell me they had found one and were holding it for me. Best birthday present ever!i have also purchased a top of the line scooter and have had the bike serviced there several times. Everything has been done in a timely manner and the people that work there are super nice.,positive
"I have now had 3 bad experiences at Gordy's so I think I will go ahead and assign the sad ""one star"". 1st experience: My husband drops off a bike for repairs and pays up front. I pick up the bike a week later and get charged the same amount - as they claimed he had not paid for it. Sure enough I found I'd been charged twice for the same work. I told them this when I went back in for bad experience number 2 and they had no interest in fixing the previous mix up. 2nd experience: I brought in a bike for repairs and also wanted to purchase a brand new bike. They make a ticket for the little bike I brought in and don't ever take it back. It took FOREVER for the person to process the new bike for me - mostly because he kept talking to people. He kept disappearing and seemed kind of lost as well. At the end, I've purchased a new bike and they say they will come and help me load it into the truck. It's a large men's mountain bike and had my bag and small child with me. The sales guy actually starts talking to a customer as he is walking back to get the bike for me and never comes back! I'm not sure if he had a massive attention deficit issue or what but then he (and an employee that is just standing around doing nothing) see me trying to keep ahold of my kiddo, my purse, and steer a bike that is way to big for me (because it was a gift) out of the store. And no one offered to help at all. I felt that was a big slap in the face when I've just purchased the bike, talk about buyer's remorse. ALSO, just to drop off the bike for repairs and to purchase a new bike (which I knew which one I wanted when I walked in the door and didn't need anytime to think it over) took ALMOST TWO HOURS! Had I not been SO desperate to get out of that place, I would have asked them to just return it because they were so incredibly rude immediately after I gave them the money for the new bike. 3rd (AND FINAL) experience: My husband goes to pick up the bike that was repaired (at least it was suppose to be repaired). They can't find it. He is there for almost an hour and after they find it, low and behold, nothing had been done to the bike. I think that they probably do good work on bikes (if they get around to doing it), as in, they are probably good at the ""hands on"" part of the work and if you don't mind waiting for lengthy periods of time AND if they don't lose your bike.... THEN you may find them to be a good fit. But they are horribly unorganized and have serious customer service issues. -- To clarify, they have never been rude, just painful unorganized and they have no sense of urgency or appropriate professional courtesy.",negative
"Bad customer service. The techs there are more concerned with chatting with friends than helping a customer. Waited 15 minutes for help, then said excuse me. Was told to wait by clerk passing on phone. Chose to leave, plenty of alternatives.",negative
Awesome set of guys. They do great work and they take care of all your freestyle scooter needs. which I have found it hard to find in the valley. They come highly recommended.,positive
"New to this shop, after a 10 yr layoff of bikes myself, I walked in for some parts for my son to get into bmx racing. They treated me like I was an old friend. Sold me what I wanted, made repairs and explained the process to me like they wanted to and they seem to enjoy all of it. Same thing every time I come back! So I keep coming back :)",positive
"My son is 6 years old and had a flat tire on his bike so we brought it up to the shop. My son was so proud of learning how to ride his bike, so he wanted to walk his bike in to the shop by himself like a big kid. Like many other shops such as skate shops or other trendy shops I was apprehensive about this feeling like the guys at the shop might just be way to ""COOL"" to give him the time of day. I was very wrong in this case. The guys behind the counter talked to him and treated him with the utmost respect, encouraged him and left him excited and feeling like he was part of something. Our family really appreciated this and will be return customers. Thank u guys so much, we will be return customers for years to come. RESPECT!!",positive
"Personalized service - called2ask a ?,went in2store,guy remembered me from phone,called back2ask another?,guy remembered me&knew exactly what I was talking about. Can't complain about price either(less than$5 total proves no price gouging!) The ONLY reason I held back 1star is there was room 4 improvement,efficiency-wise. When we walked in everybody-and I mean everybody:@least3employees&4-8 customers coming&going-was in the back of the store,in the svc area. Nobody up front minding the register and/or providing initial information/customer svc. Having a person@the register would've allowed me2ask4my part&get in&out of there in a jiffy,rather than wait for 15-20 minutes. No question: overall positive experience! I will return&support what appears 2 be a locally owned business!",positive
"As it was recommended for me to go there to find parts for an older bike that I was fixing up, I stopped in and spoke with the a guy who DID take the time to talk with me about the parts I was needing. We looked through a catalog (very over priced and not exactly what I wanted) when he then told me he would begin his search for these parts immediately. He handed me a card (which was for another person from the shop, since he did not have his own) and said he would call me the coming week. After I did not hear back, I made 2 phone calls asking about my search. Each time, the guy took a message and never called me back. I gave up on them and ordered EXACTLY what I wanted online without the middle man. Plus the prices online were about half the price and on sale. Not sure why it was recommended.",negative
"So I came into H&M looking for a birthday outfit, therefore i tried on several items. As i entered the dressing room a very goofy associate, i believe her name was Genesis, right away helped me and offered to get any additional sizes for me. As i was being indecisive, she helped me choose which outfit to buy, helping me make something like a pros and cons list, if you will. Anyway, i was standing in line very happy because i love good service, but as i reach the register the most grouchy lady i have every encountered helped me check out. Her name was Sara, she definitely made me look at H&M and their associates differently, but thank you Genesis!",positive
I'm leery about shopping here. I would hope that corporate takes interest in customer service and the attitude of its employee's. Has anyone contacted corporate? Nothing will change if you don't speak up.,negative
"Worst experience, customer service is awful! A sweater had the wrong price listed on the price tag and instead of honoring the price, they insisted for me to pay full price. Terrible terrible service-",negative
"sara is a rude af & has a nasty ass attitude . worst service. H&M should not be letting people like her be around customers. find better workers please, some who actually enjoy their job and are willing to treat people nicely.",negative
"I came in just to look at a few quick items. I wasn't actually intending to even purchase anything. The girl quickly approached me informed me that the store was closed. It was six minutes till closing time. I informed her that it was still six minutes until closing time. She said, ""Oh, I rounded up."" Very rude. Didn't even ask if she could help me. So unprofessional.",negative
It's a cool store. I love fashion and finding good treasures. The store is one of the most organized and clean from most H&M I've been too. Everyone is very nice! Also they are open at 9 during the weekdays now.,positive
"The sales associates were very rude when my mom returned an item to their store, claiming it had been worn and washed. The tags were still on the sweater, so I have no idea why they thought it was washed. I tried it on once at home and that was it. Poor customer service leaves me very disappointed with this establishment.",negative
"It's funny, I don't shop here often. Maybe once or twice a year. I have shopped off Rue St. Catherine in Montreal, and other locations in Canada infrequently, and always had pleasant service. Google reviews wouldn't show my below comments so I am posting them here. Because of that I just gave them a one there. Here I will give them a two because of the excellent service from the Accessories Manager. So I have recently found myself in a new job position and needed clothing for work. I went to a variety of stores looking for business attire since it has been a while since I have needed it. On May 2nd, I went into the store to look at the selection of mens shirts. It didn't take long before I was approached by a sales man in glasses and asked, ""Is there something I can help you find?"" He looked about my age, was good looking, and seemed like he would be helpful. He asked me what I was looking for. So I informed him that I was looking for mens dress shirts in a solid color. He then replied, ""If I can be forward with you, it might be hard for you to find that since that is not in style right now."" He then scowled and kept talking. I thought to myself, ""Oh, so what you're telling me is that the one thing I am shopping for is out of style. So in other words I am out of style."" I let him ramble on for a few minutes before I flat out told him that I disagreed. I happen to own a Tom Ford dress shirt in solid black, it might be a few years old, but it is not out of style. And for the record, I am more then sure that Tom Ford's and many other designers 2017 releases had solid colors amongst all the mini sailboat and farm animal patterns you can buy at Simons. Nothing against farm animals. I told him that solid patterns were part of the dress code at my new employer and needed to ensure that patterns on my shirts were kept to a minimum. So I informed him that I disagreed with him. I flat out told him that I find him pretentious and would like someone else to help me. Luckily, the Jeanette the accessories manager overheard me and came to my rescue. She was helpful and professional. She was friendly and courteous and everything you expect someone to be. She helped me purchase a BOSS slimfit dress shirt with very minimal ""windowpane?"" check stitching for $262. She saved the day. And I would rate this store a 5 based on my experience with her, but I think that a point needs to be made. When you are shopping for luxury goods, or even just regular goods, you need to be treated with a friendly attitude. It doesn't have to be over the top or fake, just civil. I didn't ask for advice. When you are only being paid twenty something dollars an hour, it doesn't give you the right to be snobby. If you want to be a pretentious artist, go to design school and join the crowd. When you actually design something and create your own brand, then you can come at me with your attitude if that's what you still want to do.",negative
My boyfriend bought a 1000.00 suit from Harry Rosen Chinook and they told him there was a lifetime warranty on repairs. Great! 2 years later he brought the pants back for repairs and one of the young sales guys said they couldn't fix those pants. Really? After all the hype of Harry Rosen and their lifetime warranty...So my boyfriend took the pants to his dry cleaners and guess what?? They fixed the expensive pants for 40.00! And did an awesome job! Harry Rosen couldn't even be bothered to help a client. Is their service as good as their clothing? Hmmm. Won't be going there ever again.,negative
"My son and I walked into this store and looked around looking for a shirt for him. 3 sales people standing around and not one came to even say a simple ""hi"" or a smile. What a bunch of snooty sales people. Especially the gray haired woman who looked at me, my clothes, purse. Then looked away. No customer service whatsoever. Have they not been coached that it's the first most important thing when you're in retail? Needless to say, we walked out and went into the store next door where we were welcomed warmly and spent time to actually find a shirt. Good thing I didn't Secret Shop at Harry Rosen because this review would be even worse. I will not be stepping into that store anytime soon.",negative
"Yup, this place sucks for service. I was there with a friend of mine. They asked if we needed help, but after that it was all downhill. My buddy was looking for a new shirt and tie and some slacks for a job interview. I was just browsing. When my buddy was indecisive on what to get the guy started taking shots at him like ""it's not rocket science just pick one"", you need to spend more money for the quality we have"", ""are you an accountant"",etc. Unbelievable. After the first insult I stopped browsing and the guy helping my firends continued insult him 4 or 5 times. I have had great service at the TD location, but I was so put off I question why I would ever buy from any of their locations again. The worst display of customer service I have ever personally witnessed!",negative
"OH how the mighty have fallen. You know what I will never come back to this location after last night NEVER. I may shop at the down town store because I received excellent customer service there but here I was nothing but snubbed. Listen really closely employees of Harry Rosen heed my advice. It is the Christmas season you should be jumping at the opportunity to help customers not ignoring them I was looking for a wallet to purchase. After I was so fed up with your customer service and I really mean lack of I left walked across the way into Burberry and they were more than happy to not only help me but I made a purchase that could have been yours! So lesson learned just because I'm dressed in jeans and sweater doesn't mean I don't have the monetary funds to spend in your store. The store wasn't busy employees were a plenty some folding some walking around not one and mean this not one stopped to asked if I needed help (which I did) or properly acknowledged me. Horrible horrible horrible. Say it with me now ""The customer is number 1"" the money we spend in your store influences your hours thus effecting your pay! So cut this pompous act I worked in retail for 4 years I would have been fired if I purposely ignored someone. So unimpressed! The end result doesn't really matter because I got was I was looking for else where no thanks to these guys.",negative
Exquisite Boutique in North Scottsdale. Heidi's clothing and accessories are always top of the line with the best trends and always in style for a High-end Fashion forward Look. The selection and fabric is amazing and all the style choices are Spot On. The staff is kind and friendly and the best part is that all her Fashions are on Instagram and Facebook and they can ship your selections to you anywhere. If you travel and need something on the Go -- this is the place to find the perfect outfit for your Vacay or for Date Night!! I enjoy and prefer to Shop Local and Shop Small Business and this is the place just for that! You will not be disappointed.,positive
BEST store in Scottsdale. Workers are very sweet and helpful. They have amazing taste in clothing for merchandise and carry plenty of sizes for clients. The review that had said that they only carry clothes for a size 4 or smaller is not true. The clothing she carries has sizes for every body type. Highly recommend.,positive
"I LOVE this clothing boutique!! The store is small and super cute. When I went in I was greeted with friendly faces so it made my shopping experience comfortable. I'm a fast shopper so they were helpful mainly because they can see my size and style. The selections are very trendy, and they mentioned their fall stuff will be coming in so I will def be back to shop.",positive
No need to come here unless you are a size 4 or smaller. And the selection is pitiful. You can view every item in the shop in less than 5 minutes. And not very friendly. I've been in the shop about 3 times and there has never been anyone else in there. I don't understand how they continue to stay in business.,negative
"My absolute favorite boutique in the valley. So many boutiques have come and gone over the 11 years I've lived here and Heidi's boutique remains a constant. Awesome brands, and truly phenomenal customer service. Definitely recommend. Anytime I need a dress for any event this is my go to. Huge selection of jeans and jewelry as well. Love love love!!!",positive
"Very cute patterns and clothes. However, they only had extra small's and small's. The girl working also couldn't lift her head up from her phone to greet us when we walked in.",negative
"Found this little gem in Old Town Scottsdale whole strolling about town! Darling little gifts, cute clothes and a friendly staff await you! The do really cool henna tattoos that look really fantastic as well!! Lots of things to see and give as unique gifts!! Fun hats, hair accessories and funky things for your home!!",positive
April is amazing she is a really good artist. She can customize any henna you want on any part of your body! She hand drew the entire henna and it turned out perfect. Thanks april!,positive
This is a great shop!! There were four of us who got henna tattoos and Hanna was wonderful! She was patient and friendly and helpful. We will definitely return here!,positive
"Took my 3 nieces who were visiting from the East Coast for their Spring Break to get Henna Tattoos. They were very pleased with their Hennas, and also loved the clothes, jewels and cool items the store had to offer. The staff were super attentive, prices were very fair and the girls ended up buying skirts, jewlery and gifts to bring back for their friends. We made an appointment ahead of time, which I'm glad we did because it's a busy little place. Will definitely shop here again!",positive
"Passed by the shop last night and came back today for the best henna tattoo I ever received. I wanted a dragon and we did a bit research and it came out amazing. Beth is a master and at her art. She's also super chill, kind and gives you a peace vibe that makes you want to visit with her everyday. She also took time to explain how to care for the tattoo.",positive
I really recommend going to the Henna Shoppe to get your henna done. This is my first time getting one and i loved it! I brought in my own design and Beth did an excellent job! She is awesome! I had a welcoming experience here and the atmosphere is relaxing.,positive
"WOW! Stopped in while walking around Old Town Scottsdale & so glad I did! Lydia was AMAZING with her threading skills & even went above & beyond to help me find a cute top to wear since what I packed for this trip wasn't quite cool enough. If you like an earthy feel & want to get in touch with your inner flower child while experiencing great customer service, this is the place for you!",positive
Really cool shop with relaxing vibes. Pru was awesome for my first henna tattoo! I decided to have her do a freestyle design and it turned out amazing. Can't wait to come back for another one!,positive
"Our first Henna experience was awesome! Beth was super friendly and explained everything well. There were 6 of us and they accommodated us with no problems. 3 of us even let Beth do freehand and the designs were beautiful! I am from the East Coast, but I will return the next time I'm in town. The shop also had some beautiful clothing and jewelry priced very reasonable! You MUST go!",positive
"Sally did a great job, friendly, creative, and fast, I'll definitely be back. I got freestyle on my left hand, and a cuff on my right wrist",positive
Sally was the BEST! We stopped in and had beautiful henna pieces at amazing prices. Stop in and see Sally. She is very talented. We will be back again!!,positive
Sally did a great job on our daughter's henna tattoos! She was great with the kids and everyone was happy. Cute clothes are a plus!,positive
"Was so happy with my experience here. Me and my boyfriend were just browsing around when we walked in here. I have done henna many times before but I will admit this is one of my best experiences. I mentioned I wanted an original price and explained only a couple of things o was interested in. BETH immediately had an idea in mind and said she would do it no problem. She was very understanding, nice, professional, and had an all around good vibe( which I enjoyed). She created an absolutely amazing one of a kind piece on me which I very much love and enjoy in an amazing 15 minute period. I will be coming back to this location again when I am in town next. If you are looking for good henna and good company, this is the place to go. Ask for Beth I included a picture of the initial henna, and then one from the next morning. So beautiful.",positive
Beth was absolutely amazing and really friendly when my girls wanted matching Henna's. She took the picture and was able to duplicate it perfectly on each of the girls. She is a great artist and was helpful and provided them with all of the follow up care and tips to make their Henna last. We will definitely be back the next time we are in town.,positive
"My BFF and I made a mad dash through Scottsdale before heading to the Phoenix airport. Big thanks to Sally for hooking us up with two custom henna tattoos at the last minute. Great artist, cool tunes, and a fun souvenir.",positive
Love my henna tattoo!! My daughter and I had such a great experience!! What a cute store too! Will def recommend coming here again!,positive
My friends and I decided to make a pit stop to see how this whole henna thing works and we caught Jess in the middle of finishing up a great piece of artwork on this teenagers arm and I was all for it! I am so happy I did because Jess did such an amazing job! It looks amazing and I got a lot of compliments after I had left the shop! Thank you Jess again! I definitely enjoyed the time with you and the piece of artwork you did for me,positive
"This place is amazing!! We weren't sure of what to think when we first walked in, but we were welcomed right away. The women were so nice, especially Zulma. She was so talented. Highly recommend.",positive
The ladies in the shop helped my fiancée pick out some great dresses. I suggested that she get some Henna done while she was there also so she could see if it would be a tattoo she would actually want. They turned out beautiful! Jess was patient and did a wonderful job. Great shop all around.,positive
The second you walk in you're greeted by smiles and a greeting. Super nice staff!! Was extremely in love with my henna. I honestly wanted to buy the entire store. The entire store is filled with the cutest clothes and jewelry.,positive
"Walked in at first to do a skin test and Beth was really explanatory about any allergic reactions that could happen and gave me a tiny peace sign to see if I was allergic. I came back in about two hours very happy that I was feeling fine and asked to get a koi fish done. Beth said I could pull out a picture on google and she got it done in like an hour because we were talking through it, she is so friendly and a delight! I will definitely come again and bring girlfriends too.",positive
"I love this place! I came in with my nieces and had a super fun time! Savannah gave us a beautiful design at a very reasonable price. She is extremely talented, creative and a real artist! Quick, surprisingly fun and inexpensive..I highly recommend her!",positive
The service was great!! I absolutely love my henna it is so beautiful! I would definitely recommend this place to everyone,positive
I love this store me and my husband walked around the mall and I went in yesterday after I seen a gal have it on her hand! It was awesome! So Jessica did the design on my shoulder and I fell in love with the idea! No pain and it goes away after a week! Perfect for me! I came back in today and had Beth do the design on my hand. And again it is amazing! After they finished with my henna tattoo they put a little bit of glitter dust on it! Love that little touch. Both of the gals did a fantastic job! After I had my fix of henna tattoos for the day we had Thelma thread our eye brows! Totally different then waxing ! She did a great job :),positive
"hoping this is the henna shop in the fashion square mall across from the Mac store !! if it is then I give it five stars. the store is immaculate and has amazing clothes for festivals or every day wear! the threading is AMAZING I always (and only go to) Thelma !!! I have not gotten a henna tattoo yet, but I am in the near future !!!",positive
They did such a good job and it's such a good price!! I got my henna done by Jessica and she did so good. They are so friendly too! I'm definitely going back to get more henna done soon!,positive
"Came in today with granddaughter who got the most beautiful henna tattoo from Beth. We were both delighted with it. Take a look at the photo. I got a smaller one that didn't hold up well because I got it on the lower arm and it is too active of an area (I think). Nice, clean attractive shop with lots of interesting goodies to buy. Will come by with friends soon. Thanks Beth.",positive
My 17 year old daughter and I wanted to get henna tattoos. We spent such a great afternoon with Beth and didn't want to leave. She's remarkably sweet and talented. We really had a great time. My daughter had a picture of Ganesh which Beth was able to recreate and it looked phenomenal! I LOOOOVE my palm henna tattoo. We will be back again.,positive
"We stopped in to get henna tattoos while we were walking around old Scottsdale. My friend and I had actually gotten henna the day before at a different place for the first time and our other friend wanted to get one done. This place was better by far it was more authentic and way better work and prices ! The only downfall was that there was only one artist working and at one point it got really hectic, but she even stayed late to finish all of ours ! I'm from Vegas but I will definitely be coming back to The Henna Shoppe. Beth was awesome ! Very friendly and talented ! Thanks for the beautiful henna !",positive
I've just finished getting the most beautiful henna tattoo on my hand. Beth is an amazing artist and was able to work from a photo I supplied. Thanks for a great experience!,positive
"I visited the Tempe location today there wasn't a artist available. I decided to go to the Arrowhead location and get henna done. I told the artist Irene that I wanted a hummingbird henna design and that I was having surgery next week and wanted to have henna done so I would have something pretty to look at while I was in the hospital. She then asked me ""Is that your excuse for not working out?"" I asked her what she meant but she acted clueless. To let Yelp readers know I am plus size and have lost weight and still have more to go. I was so shocked and disappointed that she had decided to make a passive aggressive mean comment to me when I was there for such a pretty thing. Shocked!! Such mean spirited comments defeat the spiritual journey of having henna done. Hopefully next customers will have a better experience. Paying $40 for insults is a bad feeling. Also, this person is the store manager.",negative
Irene did a fantastic job! Her enthusiasm for the craft was contagious. Very knowledgeable and friendly! I got the darker henna which was an additional 10 per piece... totally worth it!!,positive
"This is such an amazing store! The owner has reasonable prices because she wants to share with others, the employee's are so sweet, they make you feel so warm and welcome, Irene was so patient and sooo helpful! We Love Henna Thank you",positive
I got an amazing Henna from the artist Irene here at an increidble price. Not only did she do a great job creating what I asked but she actually helped me pick out what I wanted. I would defiantly recommend getting henna and suggest finding Irene for the job.,positive
"I love this place. My sister and I got matching Henna tattoos. Jenna who is only 16 did the most beautiful job!!!! Irene who was super funny did my sisters hand also did a gorgeous job. I am very pleased with their work and speed, can't wait to come back for more.",positive
"Irene is the best! She did some beautiful artwork of baby Groot on my arm and a beautiful design on my niece! Also, she was so kind to me when we were discussing my little brother's passing and my string of bad luck lately. If you're looking for something fun to do, get Henna Tattoos! So fun and not as expensive as anticipated! Great experience and great prices.",positive
Hailey did an amazing job with my henna. I had her do a freestyle and it was the best thing I've ever seen. The amount of detail and how little time it took was perfect. She was also very kind and sweet. I plan to come back and tell all my friends about it.,positive
Hailey was an amazing person very nice person. Love to talk to her and really respectful. She is an amazing artist. And she has a lot of patience. Hailey is a really good worker. Hailey doesn't mind how complicated or simple it is she has a smile on her face ready to do her job. I give her a 5star up for her art work and her dedication.,positive
"First time getting henna since I was a little girl. Irene greeted me with a warm hello instantly. Great customer service, creative, and fast! It looked beautiful when I left the shop! I hope it lasts awhile :)",positive
"I passed the Henna Shoppe on the way in the mall and as I went into each store, my sister and I couldn't stop talking about getting one. We looked through the binder with multiple beautifully made designs, and I chose a $20 design. Irene was so helpful and was very sweet. She is an amazing conversationalist, and it felt therapeutic as she made the design on my hand. I definitely will be coming back! Me and my sister loved our designs!",positive
"Irene did two hennas for us today; my daughter chose a beautiful hand design and I went with two super cute turtles. Thank you for making her birthday special, Irene!",positive
My daughter wanted a henna tattoo and we went to the Henna Shoppe in Arrowhead Mall. Hailey was fantastic! I even got a FREE henna tattoo with the word of the day! Definitely will go back to see Hailey.,positive
I stumbled across the Henna place at the mall. Hailey did an amazing job. Her detail was extraordinary. I would recommend. Fun experience.,positive
"Went here with my sisters and got amazing and beautiful henna, it lasted for at least 2 weeks. The staff was friendly and we really enjoyed ourselves!",positive
"Jess did a henna on my foot free handed looks amazing, would recommend this place and her to anyone she was very friendly and fun to be around as well as all other employees in the store. made this experience even better!",positive
"Julie was amazing, supper friendly! I love my henna and I'm super excited to see how it looks in a few days! She did an amazing job! Prices are great and the atmosphere there is extremely friendly.",positive
Decent work but the prices are a little expensive. Understandable though considering its in the mall. Very modern and comfortable setting. Not exactly what I expecting from a henna place but still satisfied.,positive
"Fantastic! These guys are incredibly easy to work with. Inside the arrowhead mall, the henna shoppe is clean modern and inviting. They do fantastic work anyone should take the time to try something new and get an awesome hand drawn henna tattoo!",positive
I love this place the environment is amazing. Everyone is so friendly and make the experience worth staying forever. I love the henna place anyone who loves art and great vibes check out the henna place.,positive
My daughter was excited when we walked by and saw a place that offered Henna tattoos. The owners were there and were beyond friendly and accommodating. Megan did an amazing job with my daughter's henna tattoo. I would highly recommend them and we will definitely be back.,positive
"I experienced The Henna Place as a client, where I am now an employee. I am basing my review solely on my experience as a client. I love all of the artists, and I find them all very talented. The energy they bring to their work is comforting and relaxed. The salon is beautifully designed and welcoming. I believe in this new business and I am 100% behind their vision and mission.",positive
"My best friend and I came to Las Vegas for a short shopping trip. We are both avid Hermes shoppers and looked forward to visiting the three Hermes boutiques that are in such close proximity on the strip. We walked into the boutique at Crystals. Our excitement was palpable. The security guard returned the hello that we lobbed at him first. We walked past one salesperson who did her absolute best to avoid eye contact with us. She succeeded. No greeting. No acknowledgement of any kind. Same with the second and third and fourth salesperson that we came into contact with. No ""hello"". No ""may I help you"". Never have we ever received such horrendous service, and we have spent a small fortune with the brand over years. Had this been my first impression of/experience with Hermes, I would not spend a nickel on the brand. Do better, Hermes at Crystals! Your clients deserve it.",negative
Somewhere along the line these people confused high end with uppity. Hermes is a great brand and it is unfortunate that the customer service at this location isn't on par with the quality of the product. I don't suspect my review will sway many but if I can convince one person not to go to this store (there are plenty of others in Vegas) then my job is done.,negative
The worst treatment in my life...no one greeted me and my fiancé and the only comment we got is to not take picture for a piece we were interested in...the lady yelled at us instead even to start greeting or apologizing for not taking pictures plz...I don't think this store represents Hermès at all!...I had to go out of the store and not purchase anything,negative
Wow - for incredibly TERRIBLE service! There were at least 6 sales people chatting with each other in cliques around the store and NOT A SINGLE ONE bothered to greet me or offer to help. The only contact was the security who asked me to place my enclosed empty cup of tea on the table. Felt so unwelcome I made the extra effort to walk to Bellagio Hermès for help despite staying next door at the Mandarin and not much time. But I couldn't get anyone to look at me. Weirdest and worst service I've experience in years. This store should be ashamed and the manager/employees should be fired considering this is not an isolated experience based others' review,negative
Every time that I am in Vegas I stop by the Hermes store and this time it was at the one in Crystals Shopping Mall. Never again! There was 6 people standing or sitting around the cash register talking with each other and never once asked if they could help us. We walked around until we found what I was looking for and picked it out and took it to the cash register to pay for it and had to ask someone to ring us up. When we commented on the service they then tried to be nice. Sales associates at this location have the mentality that since they work for such a high caliber fashion house such as Hermès they are better than thou and don't need to wait on anybody. The Hermes store at the Bellagio and the Wynn provide excellent service.,negative
"I was not really concerned about these negative reviews because I've always had excellent service Hermes. This branch did not disappoint me. Went in looking for a certain color shoe, they did not have it but the sales associate Jennifer Hughes was very helpful in trying to locate my color and size. Although we were not successful she still represented herself and the company in the highest of standards set out by this brand. If you're a frequent buyer of Hermes or new to the brand you shouldn't be put off by some of these negative comments. But it is Vegas so I'm sure that has much to do with it.",positive
"The sales people in this location are very judgmental. I came in yesterday with two kids in tow. I am in town for a conference and wanted to check out new items during my downtime. The moment I came in, this sales person looked at me from head to toe and asked sarcastically ""Can I help you?"" Maybe because I was wearing shorts, a tank top and flip flops OR maybe I was with my girls (who, by the way, were well-behaved). The tone was very condescending. I said yes and started asking her a bunch of questions. She looked bored when I was talking but when I said I was at the Saint Honore store earlier this year (their flagship store), her tone changed. Mind you that I was just at Prada and the team over there are way more professional-even gave my girls a bottle of Acqua Panna. Long story short, I did purchase two bottles of perfume but I will not spend my money with this brand anymore. Customer service is KEY for me as I spend money with your brand. Hermes - if you want people to represent YOUR brand, find more competent and service oriented staff members.",negative
"Sales associates at this location have the mentality that since they work for such a high caliber fashion house such as Hermès, they are next to gods and are curing cancer. I went in today inquiring about a few small leather goods that I saw on their site, I was not greeted, looked at or helped in any way. The security guy didn't even acknowledge my existence in there. I stood around waiting to see if I would eventually be helped, but sadly I wasn't. Maybe I didn't look like I belonged in there (though I was wearing my Chanel Double Flap bag) I was so frustrated that I just walked out. They lost a potential customer, one whom is considering investing in a Birkin soon. oh well, I'll go the Bellagio from now on.",negative
"I wish I had read the reviews before even spending my time calling this store. I needed a replacement box for a scarf due to it being lost in my recent move to the area. They gave me a nonsensical reason for why they couldn't give me one. I've had to replace boxes and dust bags from other stores of this caliber and each one of them were more than happy to give me one to begin a personal relationship with me. They get it and in turn will receive my business. This Hermes store doesn't, so they can do without it. Reading that they seem to have an issue with minority clients doesn't inspire me to want to shop here.",negative
I wish I had read the reviews before coming here. I picked out an item at the bellagio location with a wonderful associate but happened to be here right before my flight and wanted to make the purchase. The lady who pretended to help us was downright rude as the manager at the time pretty much told us she was right for not showing me the item. Save your time and energy and go elsewhere.,negative
"This review is for Hermes (the shops at Crystals). When I walked into the store, there was only one other customer who was being helped by an asian sales associate. Two other employees were just chatting while I tried to make an eye contact to ask for help. They completely ignored me while I was standing 2 feet away. The asian sales assoc. who was helping other customer kept looking at me but didn't say anything. The security guard's eyes followed me everywhere as I was just looking at the displays waiting for someone to offer their service. I have never felt so disrespected at a shopping mall in my life! Sorry I was dressed very casually in gym shoes carrying a backpack. I don't think Hermes employees realize that some people don't like to get dressed up in designer clothes and carry luxury purses while on vacation. The whole point of my vacation is to relax, be comfortable, have fun and buy beautiful things. Hermes employees at this location missed out on a big sales commission by judging me based on my appearance,.",negative
"Overdue review but necessary. This is a complimentary review for the Sales Associate, Vanda who was very helpful in my purchase of a Clic-Clac H bracelet. My investigative self, seeked other stores (Encore and Bellagio) to find the particular type of bracelet I was looking for. Low and behold, while none of the boutiques here had that bracelet in-house, neither would spend extra time or effort to find the item nearby....let's say Crystals. So shout out to you, Vanda at Crystals, for giving me the time and patience for having the bracelet available for purchase.",positive
"AWFUL first experience. Super disappointed. We were failed to be acknowledged at all while the SA pretended like they were busy when they really had nothing to do. We were ignored and we had to stand there looking awkward and clueless. At one point, one of the SA that was occupied called out for another person to help us and it took a long while even though she just told her she wasn't busy at all. When we finally got help, our SA rushed through the whole process including packaging, payment, rushing us out because they were closing. But honestly, if we didn't have to wait that long, you could've closed in time. Colors and varieties were really limited too.... See, at Vegas you would expect top notch customer service, especially high end stores but I was WRONG. Take your money elsewhere where you actually get some respect as a customer.",negative
"If I could give this store a -5 star I would. The sales supervisor, Dawn Harrison Smith, is rude, condescending and racist. Now I understand why her sales reps behave the same way. They need to fire her and hire someone who respects and values their customers. As I was in the store, the sales reps and Dawn only catered towards Caucasians and ignored the rest. If you're not white, don't bother coming here. They'll treat you like insects. I was ready to spend $$$$ on a bag but I brought my business elsewhere instead.",negative
"Had a great cologne shopping experience. Allison was very helpful from start to finish, and made the shopping experience comfortable. She has a vested in ensuring we purchased exactly what we wanted, and was well versed in the equine section. My girlfriend, being a rider, and her had awesome conversation, and she provided literature my girlfriend literature on their equine line. Always a pleasure to go to Hermes with staff like that!",positive
Visited this store last weekend and was pleasantly surprised with the help and customer service I received. Read the reviews and fortunately had a different experience here. I was able to purchase the exact items I was looking for (not common) and the SA made it really easy! Thanks A!,positive
"So disappointed in the lack of service at Hermes at City Center on Saturday. There were plenty of employees on the floor and very few customers, yet no one even greeted us. We were prepared to buy, but walked out. There are plenty of other retailers that welcome and appreciate the business. (Thanks Barney's, Christian Louboutin, Chanel, LV, and Red Valentino).",negative
"We stopped at this Hermes store on our way to Le Cirque. The staff was very attentive, but not pushy as is often the case in ultra high end retail stores. My wife was able to try on a variety of beautiful scarves, but we were never once pressured or made uncomfortable. Highly recommended if you're looking for high end attire!",positive
Got my first birkin here and only had to wait like 7 months! Ladies put your name down at this location if you don't wanna wait 2+ years. The hermes in my hometown san diego said I would be lucky if I got one in under 2 years.,positive
"Ugh! My sister was in town and she loves to browse at the upscale shops. We walked into Hermes and we noticed ""sales people"" just standing around. We got no smile, no greeting, no welcome. Children of the Corn! We started browsing looking at the leather goods inside the glass cases and then one ""lady"" started following us (just in case us Mexicans might steal something). This former prison guard never asked if she could help us, she just followed us. Then I asked her a question and she answered in a bored manner while looking out the window and never making eye contact with me. The only thing this dumb dumb didn't do was start filing her nails and popping her gum. I thought for sure that was next. This ex-prison guard would be more excited to get a colonoscopy than to work here. No wonder Oprah won't carry a Hermes bag anymore! (The way she was treated in Zurich it's no surprise). Don't let this group of grouches ruin your fabulous shopping day...just keep walking to DIOR or Lanvin, or Gucci, or Tiffany or Dolce, or Burberry, or ... ZARA! Honey, this is Las Vegas! There are so many other wonderful shops where you'll be treated like the King and Queen that you are. Don't do it here! Run away from Cell Block H.",negative
"2 stars because I was finally acknowledged after 5 min of being eye balled and stalked by a rep. I had to ask of course. I've been to the Encore and have had 2 lovely encounters with the SA's there that were very helpful and eagerly assisted me with a smile .It was quite opposite at Crystals when visiting my first time. They do have a larger selection which is appealing. The sales assistant chatted very lightly but didn't seem too interested in showing me much. My fiance walked out of the store because of the not welcome vibe he picked up from the women. I also walked out after noticing the snooty looks I was given by the other 2 girls behind the counter. Maybe if I wore my Jimmy choos and my Hermes dress instead of my jeans, could I have been treated with a little higher regard.",negative
"My friend and I waited ten minutes before their doors opened and once opened we were the first and only customers. We were immediately greeted by a sales lady and she attempted to help my friend who wanted to check on the status of a wallet she had pre-ordered with another sales rep (will refrain from using names) who happened to be on vacation. So my friend was sad that her wallet wasn't in yet but still wanted to leave with something so she decided to get a belt and asked to see such. We were led to the back of the store where a nice belt in Hermes orange box was presented. As for the buckles, we were only offered two (1 in chrome finish and 1 in brushed finish). My friend asked my advice and I was not impressed with either so I asked the lady if they had something more interested for instance if the H buckle came in half chrome, half brushed look. She says that they actually have several more with textured finishes BUT they were more expensive. Immediately my friend felt insulted. Maybe our casual blouse and jeans blew any chance of receiving high end service. Mind you, my friend who lives in a million plus dollar home, owns a $100k mercedes Sclass AMG, had previously purchased a 5figure handbag from this company, was carrying a several thousand dollar channel handbag, sporting carats of diamonds on finger and ears and yet was judged that maybe she couldn't afford a belt buckle that was priced $60 more? Lucky for this sales lady, my friend is a nice person and went ahead with the $800 belt which she paid for in cash. But she was nonetheless offended and took our business to another nearby boutique. Lesson be learned, don't judge a person no matter what. Per Juilia Roberts in the movie pretty woman, ""Big mistake. Huge. Sorry gotta do more shopping.""",negative
"Came into this boutique yesterday and upon entering, all the salesperson greeted me, but one saleslady just had to scanned me from my top, to my bag, and onto my shoes. Hello!?! You greet by making eye contact lady! Gosh, I wonder if the company put these sales people to Customer Service 101. Anyways, the salesperson that I usually here to see is helping another customer so I sat down on one of the comfy sofa and peruse the catalog. Some clothes are really classy and elegant, some are just outright strange looking. They also just came out with accessories for your accessories...such as a cute little horsey made of the same leather as the Hermes bag, to attach to the Hermes Bag. Price? $485. Cute, but not worth it to me.",negative
"Courtesy and respect is a no#1 priority no matter what store you are in. However, that was not the case for this Hermes store. As I went in, the majority of the the salespeople were fine. However, there was this one lady that was rude to me. I was looking and trying on leather bracelets, and I also wanted to know the price for both of them. We were conversing in Cantonese, and in the end, she made a rude comment to me, saying that ""Our customers never ask for the price; they only come to look at the designs."" That was just beyond rude. Seriously, if you don't have anything nice to say, please don't say anything.",negative
This is the newest Hermes store in Las Vegas (the one in Bellagio is closed for remodeling). I was expecting a fab collection of all things Hermes. I was left disappointed. It is sparse at best. A tiny selection of leather goods. Most bags on display were canvas. It was a bit sad.,negative
"BOO!!! Hermes, you fudged up big time by moving to Crystals. Gah, I hate that place. I cannot come visit you, and after seeing your sparse, annoyingly small boutique (more like a booth with walls). You were so perfect at the Bellagio.",negative
"For a city like Las Vegas, where every hotel & show is blown up to a grand, impressive scale, the new Hermès boutique in the Crystals shopping center is surprisingly small. The layout of the display cases is a little awkward as well - everything is very visible and sort of laid bare for anyone passing by to see, in a way. All in all, I have to say I didn't feel the cozy, welcoming ambiance that I usually get from the other Hermès boutiques. There seemed to be an overabundance of hard, shiny surfaces that reflected sound & light a little too harshly for my tastes. Of course, the items themselves are lovely as ever, but if you're looking for the more traditional H shopping experience, I would recommend sticking with one of the other locations.",positive
"i've been collecting Hermes accessories since the late 90's. back then, i never knew what it meant or why my mother would scream at me if i mistreated a silk scarf or ripped a hole in a pair of gloves. i just thought they were ""pretty things"" and never paid no mind to them. a decade and some more later... i know why my mother would take such good care of her Hermes accessories. it's the quality of the items. it's the beautifully crafted and well thought-out designs of each of their pieces. specifically- the vibrant color/ print of each scarf (the navy and emerald green is my fav.) and the classic style of each handbag. i simply enjoy shopping at this small-but-wonderful boutique in Vegas. i might like it even more than the store in LA. =) my mother shops here every year on her annual trip to Reno and Vegas with the pops. she still values Hermes as a timeless brand; i happen to agree with her as well.",positive
"I wish I would have been lucky enough to come in on a day when the staff felt like treating customers with courtesy and respect. I walked in with my sisters and my fiance earlier this month. One of my sisters and me have always toyed with the idea of owning a Birkin bag so we wanted to personally see if it was truly worth all the fuss. Well, I'm not sure if I plan on ever getting one based on the way we were treated once we entered the boutique. We were the only ones in the entire store and there were two women standing behind the counter, an older white woman and a filipino woman. They barely glanced at us, much less greet us, when we walked in, even though they weren't doing anything. I lingered around the scarves for awhile, then the bags, waiting for someone to ask if I needed help. Never happened. After about 10 minutes of being completely ignored, we decided it was time to leave. NEWS FLASH to bitchy luxury salespeople out there: Just because you SELL luxury goods doesn't mean you're worth more than the customers coming in to BUY them. (I get the same treatment from Gucci, btw. Louis Vuitton, Dior, and Chanel, on the other hand, have superb customer service because their salespeople understand the meaning of COMMISION. But that's a whole 'nother story.) I didn't care much for their bag collection, the colors that they had available seemed rather drab, in my opinion. And although my family and I do drop serious bank on luxury goods now and then, I realize that in the end, a purse is a purse. Whether you get it from Hermes or Target. To tell you the truth, it takes some kind of a**hole to buy a bag worth as much as a car just to shove their financial superiority (or major debt) in other people's faces. I mean, what other purpose would purchasing a $14K (and up) purse serve? Personally, I just don't feel like being THAT kind of a**hole.",negative
"Small boutique, but has the nicest sales associates of any Hermes I've been to. I looked at several of their ribbed silk scarves, but am having a hard time picking out a color. The sales woman put several around my neck and showed me all the different ways to tie them. I wanted to hug her. This store carries bags, scarves, enamel bracelets and fragrance. They're hoping you win big and spend here. :)",positive

"I went to Hollister around 8:45 pm this past Friday and bought a top. The girl at cash told me the total and I inserted my card to pay. I then saw the ""approved"" sign and took my card out - I was putting my card away in my wallet and the girl told me that it didn't go through and that I had to pay. I told her that I saw the ""approved"" sign, she said no. In any case, I put my card in and paid again. While she was getting the receipt, I decided to log into my online banking. I found 2 Hollister transactions- she didn't say anything and I walked away. How does a cashier not pay attention when she's working? If I'm showing you that I paid already, why are you telling me to pay. I'll just never go into Hollister again - the workers are young and rude.",negative
"Poor poor customer service! I waited in a short line, which was only me and a lady with a big stroller in front of me. The stroller was huge and it totally blocked the left side (which is usually where ppl line up from) so I lined after the lady from the middle. 10 mins later I was told by a middle aged cashier in a rude tone, ""you have to line up from the left hand side! "" Ok, so I walked around and still lined up after the lady with the baby stroller. A cashier called out ""next!"" to me, i tried moving over but the lady's stroller was way too big it blocked the entire path (and you guys must know how it's like to move between racks at Hollister, very narrow, you have to squeeze), I waited a bit trying to figure out how could I move over, then the cashier called to me impatiently again, so I ended up circling around back to where I used to line (which is from the middle) and i felt such a waste of effort!",negative
"Personally I don't know what people see in this store, it's just low quality garments being charged way over price. I would never pay a hundred bucks for a pair of jeans with holes all over the place, but that's just me. When you walk into the store they have ""greeters"" that stand outside and scan everyone who walks into the store. It's so busy and there is absolutely no place to move around in the store not to mention that forgot the lights in this store. How are you suppose to shop in the dark? All the clothes are stacked on shelves which I find extremely hard to shop with everything just piled on shelves, and especially when there is no lighting. The perfume they spray in this store makes you think maybe you are in a perfume warehouse and become lost in all this darkness. Even if you wanted to buy something from this store, the lines are always out of wack and you will be waiting a while...",negative
"Another one in the long road to nowhere in developing a 'look'. It is not by printing the name of a place in California, on a T-shirt, that it becomes a fashion item. There must be a 'cemetery' of all the names that have come before and are no longer selling. There has to be a qualitative difference between products, and it is totally cynical to expect that they will be bought simply because they have a name. This has been the road to perdition for a long list of brands, which have come and gone. In addition, when these brands open stores that feature their undifferentiated clothing, they are singularly uninspired. There is so much great fashion available out there. Independents in Toronto offer novel garments with both eye appeal and quality. Some of the old standby retailers have upgraded their look and built more fashion as well as quality in. Why another bland store, just repeating the pattern once more? I guess its a case of the bland leading the bland. Here is just a short incomplete list of lines that have seen their 'arc' come tumbling down: Vuarnet Chip and Pepper VonDutch Northbound BrandX K-Swiss .... You can add your own to the list or vote with your pocketbooks and decide to dress well. It will take more time and effort, but you will stand out.",negative
"Adorable little shop! Tucked away in the AJ's complex. The prices are reasonable, and the staff/ owner is always offering to help. Remember to keep your receipt! Ask about their Points Program, great way to get a little discount on some lovely clothes. Overall, I've had several great experiences there.",positive
"After a bad experience I had at another boutique in the same plaza, I stumbled into Hot Petunias and I knew right away that I was in the right place. I was greeted straight away by a friendly and helpful associate who sized me up and started showing me one after another fabulous outfits. I had fun there trying on different things and wound up buying three great dresses. Great customer service! 5- stars for sure!",positive
"BEWARE. Super cute boutique but they have no return policy and a 10-day exchange policy that they will not budge on. First time shopping there and I needed to exchange part of my purchase. Had I been made aware of that, I would never have purchased as I was tied up at events for the next two weeks. Very disappointed because I thought I found a great place to shop at.",negative
"Their return policy is as bad as it gets. We bought around 240 bucks worth of clothes from this place, and the tags said everything was refundable. We brought the stuff home and some of it didn't fit so we brought it back 2 days later, only to be told by the sales associate that nothing was refundable and we would only be receiving store credit. We had the receipt and everything, nothing was damaged at all. The lady claimed that she told us their return policy, but that's ver confusing considering the tags said it was refundable. Also, one of the dresses we bought got fabric residue stains on my new purse, phone case, and skin. Will not be going back here, very much a scam.",negative

"ZERO RETURN POLICY IS WRONG!!! I have been a customer since 2011 and only had a brief time when I didn't shop at this boutique while I was pregnant with my twins. Now my twins are 8 months old and I stopped by and quickly bought a dress from the window. Having shopped there in the past, I had bought items and returned them, no problems before. I am one of those shoppers who need to try things on at home and this time my husband did not like this dress that I bought. I quickly returned it early the very next day and they would not issue me a refund and only gave me a store credit and basically scolded me for not reading my receipt? What? I wear reading glasses and no, I did not read my receipt, nor did they tell me about there new return policy which is ZERO RETURNS!!!!!! They issued me a store credit was all they said they could do and basically made me feel bad about it and said it was all my fault. How is it that you buy something and then it's on the receipt that they have a ZERO RETURN POLICY? That is not fair. You should make your sign larger and place it in all the dressing rooms so we can see it and read it. I had no idea when I bought this dress that I couldn't return it because my last experiences, a year and a half ago were good. What if this business closes it's doors and I only have a in store credit? This is not fair to the consumer! I would like my money back please!",negative
This is the perfect boutique to find a great outfit! They have very cute clothes and not to mention AFFORDABLE! Being in Scottsdale...it gets old when every boutique is so overpriced! Trust me it's worth the quick peak...but guaranteed it won't be quick ;) It's just refreshing to buy cute clothes at reasonable prices. Oh and the service is great too!,positive
"Darling, not stuffy, well priced, boutique!! Met the owner twice now, and she's very nice. Looking forward to having a close by shop with great stuff.",positive
Blue haired cashier lady needs to be fired. she has a horrible attitude she refused service cuz my dad threw money at her apparently. she was negative the whole time. argued with me about that situation she's not a good person for customer service. manager was amazing but the blue haired lady was rude and needs to be fired,negative
"At first the customer service seemed good but it was a lie. She we walked in the store the girl said we can get 25% off everything we can stuff in a bag if we bought the bag. After an hour of shopping for stuff we wanted, the line was huge as they were not checking people out fast enough. Then we go to check out and the cashier says that we can't get the discount on the items we bought. Super pissed off now, I told her that's not what the other lady said, she didn't seem to care. So basically I will never shop at this brand again. They need to get it togther.",negative
"I came by Hot Topic and found a tank for Dia de Los Muertos today and was stoked to find something while on vacation. First of all this store is a mess, and the employees didn't seem helpful. I was standing waiting for a fitting room and not acknowledged as workers passed by a few times. I finally got to sneak into the only fitting room they had once somebody left the fitting room to try on two sizes. Excited to purchase it I headed for the cash register and the girl working it was ignoring me looking down at her paper as I was right standing in front her. After awhile she finally glared at me and said she could ring me. She then bugged me four times to buy a second item to get half off the second item. I said no thanks because I only needed one item and then I headed out happy to get out of there with my new buy. Then I realized as I left the mall and was in the parking lot I took off my priceless sunglasses when trying my top on. I hauled back to the store the ""alarm"" was going off. Luckily nobody went into the the fitting room I grabbed my shades and stormed out. ""Beep, beep, beep!!!"".. Again And so I had I felt my bag and my ""favorite"" cashier left the security tag on :( Just my luck I had to go back inside and the other cashier was pleasant and apologized as she removed the security tag and the chick who helped me didn't say sorry and was being awkward.",negative
"This store is absolutely disgusting. Nothing is in the right spot, the staff is frazzled, and everything is so close together that if there are two people in the store you can't help but bump into them. Boxes are half open, I am certain the shrinkage in this store is huge, and the prices are high for the quality. Why, you ask, did I even enter this den of despair? Because they sucker my tween in with minecraft, pokemon, and my little pony paraphernalia. However, this store is the worst Hot Topic I have been to.",negative
"We were greeted at the door so that was nice. I waited patiently to have an associate get a shirt off the top rack and was ignored. Then, my friend goes to pay and they ran out of change. I have never been to a Hot Topic in my life and even with super cute The Breakfast Club items, I would not return.",negative
The staff was friendly and even searched for an item I had been looking for. They found the last one they had in the store for me.,positive
Several sales staff on the floor and the male staff amused me in answering my questions. Think I might have made him feel uncomfortable when I asked about his ear and the spacer size he was at. If nothing else I got a kick out of it. :-) not a store I would buy things for myself anymore but could find things here for others.,positive
So the only thing I ever go into Hot Topic for is jewelry for my piercings. My sister and I always go to the Galleria Mall because it usually has the best stuff. HOWEVER I honestly think that the Sales Associates at this Hot Topic are lacking an I.Q. I have been there so many times and when I need someone to show me jewelry I look around and they are all talking. I see none actually helping customers at the long line at the register. One experience in particular I wanted to buy a nose stud so I went up to a male Sales Associate and asked him to open it for me. I walked back to the stand thinking he was coming and he was just looking at me. Then he continued with his conversation and ignored what I had just asked. I was shocked so I kept staring to see if he was coming. I went up to him again and asked him if he even worked there and he said yes. Then I asked why he hadn't opened the jewelry case like I had politely asked him to. He then had the nerve to say that he though I was staring at him...he thought I was hitting on him. I just left the store and never went back.,negative
Came in and we were happily UNWELCOMED! The girls ignored us and then as I was looking at a bra in a package so I carefully opened the package to look at it before purchase and some little snobby girl comes up and RUDELY TELLS US WE ATE NOT ALLOWED TO OPEN IT AND READ THE SIGN! There was no sign displayed where I was it was at the opposite end. I would never go back in this store and will tell all my girlfriends to stay away from here! There are too many good options in the area where you are welcomed as a customer! If I could give a 0 star i would!,negative
"It's true, their customer service sucks. It's not the fact that they ignore you, because sometimes, we just like to be left alone and shop for ourselves. What I didn't like was that they made it obvious they're pretending to straighten the racks while closely following me around. Please little girls, you need better loss prevention tactics than that. I've worked in retail before, I'm on to you. My handbags costs more than your entire paycheck so go and take a seat. I was asked multiple times if I was ready for the fitting rooms. I didn't have an armful of clothes, just ONE item. Relax. So when I was finally ready to purchase said item, there was nobody at the cash register. Hellooooo I'm standing in front of your cash wrap....do you not see me? They must be OCD about straighten up the store versus processing a transaction. I waited and waited until I had to tell a sales associate I'm ready to be rung up. The cashier was clueless on how to process my transaction using a Visa Gift Card (In case any of you little girls who work here are reading this: there's already money on it. It's a gift card. Process it like a normal credit card. No it's not a debit card, I don't have a PIN number. No you don't need to see my ID. It's a VISA GIFT CARD. It says ""Gift Recipient"" on the card, my first and last name won't be on it.) Won't be shopping at any of the Hotties in town. They're all just as bad. I've read those reviews. I only came to check this place out because I was running errands in the same plaza this store is in.",negative
The absolute worst place to shop. ..extremely rude and a bunch of inexperienced teenagers who haven't any clue about customer service. ...this is for the staff who was there in February...I wrote a more detailed review then but took it down because I am going to sue them...I can't day for what right now but depending on my attorney advice we are going public...this place is shameful. ..they need to pack up shop and be removed from Boca because they do not belong there.,negative
Came the store twice to pick up for some casual wears and ended up buying more than I should! The workers were all so helpful and asked if I needed help and set up dressing room for me when I needed. Would definitely return to shop again!,positive
"Terrible place! They don't let exchange shoes for different size the same day or purchase And also the shoes had diffract. Oh, and there us no one to help! There is no customer service!!!!! There is no phone number to call at all",negative
"The customer service here is a complete joke. All of the girls who work there except for maybe one or two of them, are so incredibly rude. I had called in earlier that day to see if there were off the shoulder tops and the girl talking on the phone was not only rude, but was also talking to her co-worker WHILE on the phone with me. Very unprofessional no matter where you work. Her exact words to her co-worker were, ""oh no way dude."" I was in shock. When the girl was explaining the tops they had that were similar to what I was looking for, she had an attitude and sounded like she was 12 on the phone. So since she didn't help me find what I was looking for whatsoever, I had to come into the store to look myself. When I came in an employee was standing right by the door, was on her PHONE, and did not greet me. I work in retail myself and would never imagine not greeting a customer OR would ever dream of being on my phone! Crazy. So, after finding a top I liked, I needed to run into another store just to see bottoms that would match the top. When I asked to put it on hold for about 20 mins until I came back, (what seemed to be) the manager rolled her eyes and said, ""um, well are you going to come back?"" And I replied with a yes. She ignored me and turned her back to me. I asked if she needed my name just in case and she said no and turned back around. I am at a loss for words with how unprofessional the employees are.",negative
"I love this store and this location is a bit busy to find a parking. They have cute and sexy clothing - dress, tank tops, pants, skirts and also shoes, jewelleries, lingerie, etc. I buy a lot of clothes from Hottie. The customer service is ok. The clothing is not pricey in my opinion but sometimes you will find some pieces does not have good quality esp clothing that have jewelleries on it breaks. They don't have any reward program, wish they did. They also don't call another store for the size I was looking for. Most sales are final so make sure you like it.",positive
"Horrible Experience. I shopped at the Hottie store, once every 2-3 weeks, their staffs just want to get sales in. Customer service is absolutely horrible and no one is helpful. I bought a pair of shoes which I decided to return it after trying it on again at home to walk around and the shoes gave me blisters all over my feet. Just 3 hours later I went to the location on flamingo right by my house and the assistant manager said, she will not refund it and she cannot call the other store for me!!! Lmaooo!!! I contacted the store in rampart where I originally made the purchase and spoke to Cassandra, she said, she will call me back after speaking to her manager. She called me within two minutes and said she heard a recording that she has told me sales are final, I informed I'm on my way to store and she can play the recording for me. She said she will not!!! I asked to speak with a manager and responded, there is no manager in the store. When few minutes back she said she will speak to one and call me back!! The other store was only 5-7 minutes away as soon as I walked in, they told me Cassandra just went on break!!! How convenient!!! I asked for manager's business card, they said she doesnt have one!! How messed up is it that a store manager does not have a business card??!! I left the pair of shoes and will be calling the bank to dispute the transaction. The staffs were lying and my purchase was only within hours and on same day!! Its not like the shoes was in a bad condition and I went weeks or days after, to return it... F***cked up client service. I left my phone number,, so lets see if the manager will contact me which she never did.",negative
"I'm not sure where all of the negative reviews are coming from. Lol I've honestly browsed this school since middle school, but being older (23) now I can honestly buy the clothing now that it's more age appropriate. This past weekend I was visiting Vegas - I moved to California but regardless - and my friend and I decided to go to Hottie. We've never been disappointed before and we needed an outfit to go out on Saturday. My review is for the customer service, but specifically for TAY. I believe that's the name she goes by. This is a small description, but she's a petite, brunette, Caucasian woman who wears glasses. She looks about 19 or 20. She helped my friend and I out so much, from finding shoes to go with the outfit that I had tried on to finding the shirt I really loved that wasn't damaged and still units packaging. Also, she gave us honest opinions on our outfit choice, and she wasn't pushy in terms of what we should buy from the store, and some sales associates can be like that. I really appreciated TAY's service. What stood out to me was the patience she had with my friend and I, but specifically me as I can be indecisive. Thank you so much TAY! Oh made the experience amazing. If a manager is reading this, TAY is awesome! Now for the clothing, they have a great sale section. The items are affordable and a good mix of basic pieces along with club wear and sexy casual wear. I bought a midi maroon skirt for only $9. There are very cute bustier tops with jewels on them for an awesome price. I love that this store caters to almost every customer, although I'm not sure that I would ever buy their sports wear. The store associates were very attentive to my friend and I. They offered to start a fitting room for us as soon as they saw us with a lot of the items in our hands. I like that I was greeted upon entering the store. One thing that would really be a nice add on is if I would have been able to find someone when I needed to reach items higher up. It can be hard to spot a sales associate at times because they blend in, but everyone was wearing great, fashionable and appropriate clothing. Thanks a ton! I will definitely be back in here when I come back to visit.",positive
"I had a very terrible experience at this store and I honestly would not recommend shopping there. The return policy is absolutely terrible. It's even worse because I was not notified about the return policy when I made my $80 purchase. A professional business will notify the customer of the return policy before the customer makes the purchase so they are aware, however the woman who checked me out never even told me about the policy. So when I came back to make a return for my expected refund, she said I could only get store credit. This greatly upset me because I was never made aware of the policy. When I confronted her, she said that the policy is on the receipt, which is totally irrelevant at that point because once you're given a receipt, you've already made the purchase, so her argument was completely void. She then took down my name and number for my store credit, and when I came back to redeem it they said they didn't have my information and just ignored me after. Bottom line, the customer service is VERY bad, the clothes are not especially unique, and I will never step foot into that store again. Thats $40 down the drain for me.",negative
"I don't know what all the negative reviews are about, hottie is one of my favorite stores. I've never been treated unfairly at this location and the cashiers always make sure to tell me the return, or rather no-return policy. Only giving four stars because yes this store, years ago, used to have much higher quality clothes and was more of a boutique. Now they seem to be carrying quantity over quality but I still like most things they have.",positive
"Walking in, the store has very cute clothes. The clothes were not the problem, but the customer service sucked! When my mom and I asked for a fitting room so she can try on some items, we wanted to enter the same room (it's easier to give opinions in a closed room instead of having to step out after every outfit change). Apparently that is not allowed, but the employee kept hovering and would not leave us alone while we were in the dressing room, along with after when we exited the room. I understand the threat shoplifters pose to the business, but not every person that walks in has the intention of shoplifting. We were so uncomfortable that we put down what we were going to purchase and left. I don't appreciate being treated like a criminal. Learn how to treat your customers. I refuse to give money to a business with such crappy customer service.",negative
"I'm aware of the return policy although I do think every customer deserves a full return for unworn items. I love this store a lot, the prices are reasonable & the clothing and shoes are so cute but it's impossible to shop here because when you are shopping the staff seriously makes you feel like a criminal. Everytime I'm there they follow me, stare at me, etc. these girls will seriously hide in racks to make sure you aren't stealing lol. They ask me EVERYTIME I pick something off a hook if they can take it to the fitting room. Seriously I'm here shopping and I have my baby with me, stop treating customers like this. & let us shop in peace. Oh and last thing, SNOBBY GIRLS as staff.",negative
"If I could give 0 stars I would. Worst customer service ever! When I bought a dress there I specifically asked if I decided to bring the dress back could I get my money back. The little girl behind the counter clearly said yes. I brought the dress back and was told that either exchange or store credit only... In a condescending manner. This was my first and last time shopping here. Even if you shop online stores they offer a full refund if you aren't satisfied. It's called customer retention. Apparently, Hotties does not care to keep customers coming back.",negative
I usually find really cute things at Hottie stores but it's gotten to the point where I can't even shop here anymore. The girls in the store ask so many times if I need help and as soon as I pick up an item I get asked if I need a dressing room. I ended up trying some things on today and settled on a pair of pants. I was walking around the store and the sales girl literally asked if I was going to buy the pants as I'm trying to find a top. You literally can't shop here without being bombarded. Too bad. Today was the last straw won't be shopping here anymore.,negative
"Worst customer service ever!!! Asked what the return policy was and the girl told me full refund with receipt. Asked her 2x to make sure. When I went to return a shirt they would only give me store credit even when I had the receipt but claimed ""cause they had a sign posted so nothing they can do."" Even though the SAME EMPLOYEE who told me the return policy told her manager that she said I could get a refund. They still wouldn't do anything. First time shopping there and forever my last!!! Ran like a mom and pop store. Train your managers on using judgement calls and training your own team you own return policy!!!",negative
"Cute clothes that not everyone else will have! They have a ton of sexy dresses, rompers, tank tops, crop tops, bustiers, and SHOES. Their heels are probably my favorite. And the sales are pretty reasonable too, with a huge selection. Staff have always greeted me and been very nice as well.",positive
"I have never had anyone ask to help me. Things seem over priced for quality. Bought a shirt online and was damaged. It also didn't fit well so I returned it. They said they wouldn't return it. I am aware this is their policy but wouldn't even give me a credit. So I thought give it back and I'll donate it. Nope I would be charged shipping and handling. For an item I don't like, is poor quality and damaged. NOPE won't give this business anymore of mine ever!",negative
I love this place! I wish there were Hotties in my area. This place is better than Forever 21 and much more organized. Love their velour track suits here.,positive
"I like Hottie's for the location convenience. I'm not a huge shopper or a fashionista and I don't like going to the mall. I'm just your average girl who likes sweater and jeans in the winter and dresses in the summer. I don't do crazy prints and I'm pretty boring in my color selections. However, if I ever need something to wear to go out, I check out Hottie's. Sometimes I find something, sometimes I don't. There's a lot of clothes on the rack and you just need to sort through them to find treasure or whatever meets your needs. Overall, somethings can be fairly cheap and somethings are pricey, but I will be back for more!",positive
"One star for freaking rudeness. Word to the wise Hottie that in this economy every person that walks through your front door should be acknowledge by your chicken-heads staff. I was never acknowledged, but I noticed that a woman who was of Caucasian persuasion was greeted very warmly. I immediately knew I was not spending my green dollars where my business was not welcomed. I am a woman of color, and I noticed when I entered some other boutiques in the area I was immediately recognized, and greeted. Sad that in this day, and age some idiots think some people are not worthy as consumers. Your loss Hottie, and your disposal clothes are not worthy to be part of my closet.",negative
"Sometimes a girl just needs a ten dollar shirt to go with her three hundred dollar shoes. Hottie fills the need of the last minute outfit or dress when one simply cannot find something to wear in her closet. This women's clothing store always has selections of colorful, trendy, fun stuff. I love running in at the last minute to grab a little dress for dinner or a great necklace to finish off an outfit. They do have shoes, if your in dire need of a pair, although it isn't usually my reason for going there. They have absolutely divine summer dresses and tunics. With a couple in the valley and usually off the strip, this place is great for us locals when we have been invited to dinner at the last minute!!",positive
Do not go shopping at this Bay location on a Monday and expect to have sales people available to help you or even fitting rooms open in the ladies department. This store is so understaffed it is no wonder they are losing sales. Some of us prefer not to shop on the weekend when it is busy but we still would like a fitting room open should we find something we'd like to try on when we do shop.,negative
"This review is for the Clinique counter. Just terrible in general. I've come to this counter on a number of occasions and not once has anyone come approach me for help. If it not for Sephora not carrying a lot of their products I wouldn't come here if I could help it. The Bay is going the way of the dinosaur if they can't ramp up their customer service the way Nordstrom, Holt Renfrew, and Sephora treat their customers. My last visit here I waited at least a good 7-10 minutes before I decided to just leave and order online. The SA was clearly there just unpacking Christmas packages and not interested in helping me at all. Can you see people hanging around your counter in the corner of your eye? I'm sure you can! All it takes is a hello, and could you wait a sec I'll be right there! The Bay is intimidating for the average consumer to shopping in. No one needs this kind of treatment or service.",negative
"Watch repair: this review is specific to Watch Repair. The prices have consistently gone up and are now $16.99. They are very slow and usually a line for some reason. Go to the ""Watch It"" store just a 5 minute walk down the mall. They are at least $2 cheaper and are quick and friendly. They both use Swiss Renata batteries.",negative
this is a fadulent company that charges credit cards of customers and never processes the online orders. please do not buy online!,negative
"Haven't been to The Bay in forever. Not sure why? I was on a mission since I saw a dress in a magazine and after some research, found out The Bay carried it. Looked around for a while since I couldn't find it any where and thought I better ask someone. I was directed to the section that would carry that brand and looked some more..... No success finding the dress in the Inc. section. A bit of a bummer! After not finding the dress, I thought I would look around at the rest of The Bay to see what else they carry? They do have some cute stuff woman's clothing wise but nothing I was dying to buy. The staff was friendly and I will admit every section I did go into, if there was staff I was greeted. Always nice. Went to fragrance section and did end up buying some stuff, so not a total bust of a shopping experience. Didn't find the dress I was looking for, but will be back another time.",positive
"I don't see the need for all the hate on The Bay! I enjoy this location because it is less busy than the one downtown or at Chinook, usually. I agree with Melissa's advice, never to purchase something full price at The Bay. They tend to have killer sales if you wait for them. Just this week, I scored a pair of half price vegan boots...at this price, I won't feel bad if I have to pay to get them resoled in the future, or if I buy a new pair next year, as many comparable fashion boots from other stores come with quite a high price tag. I do miss when The Bay used to carry Levi's jeans which they phased out of this year, because I became accustomed to buying my favourites there for about $30 whenever there was a Bay days sale. I noticed most of the complaints revolve around the cosmetics counters in other reviews, which I can't really speak to. When MAC was still cruelty free, I found the girls at The Bay here really friendly. The counter was usually fully staffed and I always chose this over the other MAC location in the mall. Now that they aren't, however, I take my makeup needs to Sephora or teh interwebz. You're alright, The Bay. *Review 2/30 of Yelp's 30 Day Challenge 2012",positive
"I shopped once at Clinique but it wasn't great never go back. First of all, I guess it is not a busy counter at all. I have not seen many customers when I every time I pass there. I know now why. The SA has horrible manner. No knowledge about their products. They can not even find a match for my foundation. A SA called me ""insane"" when I returned the product.Rude. I would go to Sephora instead they carry fresher stocks and SA are nicer.",negative
"My wardrobe is FULL of great clothes that I bought at The Bay. Even as a high school student I knew how to make the most of their sales (my grad dress was from The Bay - regularly $220 on sale for $56 at the last minute!), and I've been devoting an hour or two to their end-of-season sale racks each season since. Just last week I was in The Bay at Market Mall and found a beautiful, on-trend blazer (perfect for transitioning into fall) that was regularly $198, marked down to $58, PLUS an extra 50% off the last marked price! The trick at The Bay is never to buy anything full price, and to go prepared to sort through the disastrously-organized higher-end sale racks (Rachel Roy, Halston Heritage, Calvin Klein, BCBG Generation, etc.). Skip all of their house brands, don't expect the employees to be able to provide accurate information, and prepare to wait in endless lines at the cash register... and you'll get great clothes at prices so low you'll feel like you need to run out to your car before the cashier realizes she's made a mistake!",positive
"It's not like you'll often catch me in The Bay, but for a very specific couple of reasons, I needed to make the special trip into this department store yesterday evening. First of all, can I just say how oddly dispersed their staff was? In some areas there were 3 people too many, and in some other areas, there was only one person, who happened to be giving a makeover and couldn't help me with what I needed to purchase. It's not like I was that customer that needed them to explain all the different products to me, I knew exactly what I wanted, who makes it and where it's available. I just needed them to ring it through and take my money. When I did finally get some service, the woman totally passed me up to another staff member. She was ridiculously snooty, and unsurprisingly, so was the other staff member that she had passed me over too. Then I continued to look around in the fragrance section and I felt like I was being watched like a hawk. The Bay staff kept hoarding around as though I was 4 years old and about to break something. Finally a man looked me right in the eyes and said ""Do you have any questions?"" I was like ""Uh no...."" proving to him that I was fully capable of speaking and asking for help if I required it. For the time that I was in The Bay, I felt like I had stumbled into a realm where it's a prerequisite for everyone to be snooty, rude and full of themselves. Last night helped me discover why I am not an avid shopper at The Bay. The chances of you catching me in there ever again are slim to none.",negative
If I could put no stars I would. I ordered 10 shirts online and when I got my package today it was missing 1 shirt. I called the online number and was told there was nothing they could do except refund my money I asked if I could just have the order shipped only if I paid again for it I said I already paid for it and got the run around I will never ever shop Penny's again!!!!!!!!!!,negative
"Ive gone to this JCPenney multiple times for many years and never had a bad experience. But today when I was in line i was very uncomfortable because this worker Maryland was very rushed and was constantly complaining about it being busy and how thy are understaffed. She was like almost crying in her hands and saying to everyone ""im sorry for the wait were very understaffed and busy and im trying i know im trying"" when there was nobody complaining or even impatient. The three people in line were very calm including me and she just was very unprofessional and rushed and kept complaining on the phone and to herself very loudly. I felt very uncomfortable leaving. She was also kind of rude and kept pushing her coworker to get off the phone when she was in the middle of helping someone on the phone. Maryland was very unprofessional for no reason.",negative
"Bad customer service at JC Penney's customer hotline. Alorie is rude and nasty. She argues with callers as if she is on the streets fighting. She is very argumentative and will never give you a chance to speak. Attention JC Penney management: if you want to keep paying customers, get rid of this one.",negative
"This review is for the poor management of the Portrait Studio; We made an appointment but we still had to wait 2 hours. It was the only day our family could all get together otherwise we would've left. From them deleting poses of my baby & ordering the wrong photos, this was by far the worst photography experience of my life. We had to return for reshoots & had to come back twice more to pick up the corrected items. Mind you it's a 30 minute drive one way from our home. Our only compensation was a free session & print coupon for our NEXT trip. What makes them think we want to go back?",negative
"Good customer service, decent selections, and plenty of parking. The mall is not as popular as it once was for shopping, but this JC Penny is the few that is not closing. There is a lot of heavily discounted items in every department. From women's apparel, menswear, home decor, and jewelry. Some parts of the store looks dated and other spots look ok, bit everything was well organized and clean. I think you can tell they are trying to see what works. They have a nice makeup section too, but I was looking for some t-shirts and blouses, which I did find and all at a very reasonable price. I would go back even though it is a little bit out of my way because sometimes I just don't want to wait for shipping and I actually want to see the material in person instead of a description. Would recommend.",positive
After moving into a new apartment we needed a few things. Stopped in here to pick them up and were very happy with our experience. Nice looking store inside and out. Friendly staff. Will definitely visit here again.,positive
"I LOVE THIS JC PENNEY!! This location is so clean!! If you are looking for a clean store with great prices, this is your place. I really like this JC Penney because it sits off by itself and isn't tied to an indoor mall. Staff is friendly and eager to help everytime we are here. Clothing is reasonably priced and won't fall apart on you. I really like there selection of workout wear and t-shirts. Again, affordable t-shirts and they offer a nice variety of colors and sizes. If you go to JC Penney online you can you can usually download coupons. You can either print or show your cell phone with a bar code for instant savings. Bonus in my book! ;) I definitely recommend this store. Enjoy!! :)",positive
"I had my daughter's first pictures taken here who is 8 months old. It was better than I expected. I sometimes have a hard time getting pictures of her smiling, but the photographer had no problem at all! The most important thing is that they have people scheduled every 15 min this holiday season and they are booked, so arrive early to check in. If you are late you will have to wait for a next opening. They showed me my options on things I could do and order but were not pushy at all! I definitely will be coming back next year for more :)",positive
"I had the best shopping experience yesterdsy. Not only was Penney's having great sales and clearance discounts, they have an additional 20 percent discount to JC Penney credit card holders, and an additional 15 percent to brand new card holders for 24 hours. I explained to Donna, the customer service agent, that I wanted to purchase 2 items available online and she ordered them for me shipped to this store location to receive free shipping and obtain the entire 35 percent discount. She went above and beyond customer service by definition and am so thankful for her service, thinking outside the box and truly caring. I then brought My Mom that evening and we used the 35 percent discount and received another $10.00 discount based on the days purchases! What a great shopping experience - I will be back! Thank you Donna!",positive
I love this location! It is close to my house and very convenient. The store is huge and the layout is great. The staff is very friendly and helpful. This is the cleanest JCPenney I have ever been in. There are great selections for your whole family. Be sure to keep your eye out for clearance as there are some terrific bargains to be had. Kudos to staff and management for making it a truly great shopping experience. I will be back for sure.,positive
Awesome shopping experience! Their Alfred Dunner collection is extensive and well-priced to clear spring/summer inventory. Found several great items for traveling and dinner time choices. A special thank you to my very helpful daughter and Donna at this store for assuring my bill was the lowest it could be! What a delightful young lady Donna is.,positive
"If i could give less than 1 star I would. Just went to pick some new clothes up for my kids after our online order got cancelled and we were not notified. At the register we encountered the most rude, miserable, unprofessional person i have ever seen. Im assuming she was a supervisor and she was hispanic. She treated us as if we were not paying customers and as if we were beneath her. She not only treated us this way but the remaining customers in line this way. SHE SHOULD BE FIRED! I will never visit this jcpenny again and I would advise them to remove that miserable person from interacting with any customers. WILL NOT BE RETURNING TO THIS LOCATION!",negative
"This is a Review strictly for Sephora. I always shop at Town Square Sephora or the ones on the strip but I received a gift-card that could only be used at this location. I called in advance one day asking to come in and get my makeup done. (If you spend $50 they do your makeup at Sephora.) They said they couldn't because there was only two of them in the store. uh ok? So I called a Saturday and they said they couldn't because ""they were hosting an event"". I decided to go in anyways because I need foundation. Upon arrival I saw two cashiers talking to a woman at the checkout. Neither greeted me. After wandering aimlessly around the store & not receiving any help I made my way to the cashier she asked ""are you ready?"" again without greeting me or asking if I found everything ok I asked her for help and asked if The Sephora line made a lipliner. She walked me over to the section and said ""uhh I guess we don't have it in this fixture."" & she did not suggest a different line like most good sales associates would do. They are not friendly and they are not knowledgeable of the products. Then when we went back to check out she forgot to mention I had points and could get a free gift. I had to remind her. Also no one told me anything having to do with their ""so called event."" I will never return here, I'll stick with the more professional Sephoras.",negative
"Christmas shopping at this location over the past couple weeks and wow has customer service here gone downhill quick. I've spend hundreds here over the past few weeks. I'll break down my two recent experiences. First attempted to go to the salon and get a haircut. Simple enough and something I have done here many times. I arrive up to the counter to check in. There were two customers getting haircuts and approximately 3 stylists standing around talking not really doing anything. Barely got any kind of acknowledgement or even a hello. Advised I'd like to get a haircut. They all had a look on their face that it would be a bother to try to cut my hair (especially the lady with purple/pink hairdo she is downright rude). Every one of the stylists with me standing right there all start going back and forth with each other making excuses why they shouldn't have to help me. ""I can't do it have her do it."" Well I'm not going to do it have this person do it"" and so on you get the idea. Makes you feel welcomed wouldn't it? Finally I just say forgot and sorry to bother everyone. The visit after this I was buying nearly $300 worth of jewelry. Long story short they were dishonest and sold a ring I was supposed to pickup that I had on hold for 2 days. Then tried to tell me the display case one was the same one same size and I believed it and bought it. Soon realized the damn ring is two sizes smaller than the one I reserved for pickup. They were completely dishonest and didn't honor their word and resold the ring. In fact the day I show up to pick up the ring nobody has any clue what I'm talking about. This was after waiting to be helped a jewelry counter for 30 minutes to be assisted. They had ONE person to work jewelry in the middle of Christmas shopping season. She did the best she could but helped people that were there after me which was frustrating.",negative
"This is the jcpenney I usually go too because it's within my neighborhood. Marissa is always very accommodating and helpful. She welcomes us with a smile and recalls us every time we come it. She provides great customer service and allows me to use my coupons when I make qualifying purchases. Checkout process with Marissa is always a breeze, she makes things easy. Michael and Erlinda are two other associates who knows what they're doing. They are very nice and helpful as well.",positive
"This is a great store, I'm surprised I haven't been coming here more often. The store is very clean and they associates there are very friendly. They have a great selection for girls clothing and their prices are some of the most affordable that I've seen without sacrificing quality. I had a great experience with an associate by the name of Marilyn that told me about the rewards program and was just an overall friendly person. I have no complaints about this store. The portrait studio at this location is also great. My daughters pictures came out really nice and it was easy to locate a coupon. The fact that they also have a Sephora there is even more of a bonus.",positive
"EXCEPTIONALLY RUDE AND RUSHED. CHRISTY IS THE MANAGER. CONFRONTATIONAL- threatening and did not stand behind what I was told. Basically called me a liar. Would not reach out to the employee who just the day before told me one shirt change would be ok. Christ Kept "" putting in her last rude comments and then threatened not to allow us to stay for our session if we said anything"". I asked to have another photographer and she told me "" she ran things here not me"" I HAD BEEN COMING HERE FOR YEARS. I WILL NEVER RETURN.",negative
I'm not a bit Penneys shopper but there's a Sephora inside and I do love Sephora! The store itself was bright and well merchandised and if I hadn't just dropped bank at Sephora I would have stopped in the jewelery section because there were a few things that caught my eye.,negative
"this store change to the worse, two years ago they have better quality clothes and the price was better. Even the customer service is terrible, they chose who they attend too.",negative
"Holy shit! When did JC Penney become cool? I couldnt believe their selection. Yea, they aren't Macy's or Dillards, or whatever, but they have some cool ass shit. Did you know they sell Sephora. Now, I dont use their products, but I know they are good. (OK, I've heard they are good). Levi's, Liz Claiborne, Dickies (to name just a few) of the name brands that they sell. I couldn't believe it. Seriously, I was shocked. It was close to closing time and I didn't have time to look around but that's gonna change! Next time I'm in a shopping mood (it happens monthly, hehe) THIS is gonna be the place I check out first. Customer service was excellent. Machelle (yes, that's how she spelled it), was fantastic. Pretty much escorted me around trying to find a work shirt. Oh, and 25% off EVERYTHING in the store that day....BOO YEA! Me likes alot! Open an account and you get 20% off. I can't wait to get my shop on here!",positive
"I'm disappointed. We were looking to get a watch battery replaced and went to the jewelry section to ask for help. One lady was legitimately helping a customer, but couldn't take two seconds out to let us know that she'll be with us. So we moved to the other kiosk where there were two sales representatives helping one lady. Surely they could have taken some time out to assist me? Nope. The dynamic duo refused to even look my direction as I waited at the counter patiently for five minutes for someone to at least speak to me. Five. Minutes. I finally had it and went to Sears Grand where people at least responded to you. Great quality clothing, but some of the sales representatives obviously need a lot of work in the training department.",negative
"Years and years ago I had a hairstylist at a very chic and trendy salon here in town. I went to her for a couple years. I only saw her once every other month, sometimes a bit longer. Each time I noticed she was making some noticeable ""lifestyle"" changes. Nothing major...when I first met her she was married with a child. She divorced, started dressing younger and she would tell me about all the partying she was doing. Typical divorcee stuff, no biggie. On what would be my last appointment, I noticed she was really different...she was completely strung out and totally out of it. Resting herself on my head at various times throughout my appointment. Dropping her tools. Asking me if the pictures in the salon were crooked. Another customer was telling a story about how a coworker had given her a pill for her headache and how she ended up in the emergency room later that night...turns out the coworker had given her an OxyContin. Upon hearing this story, my stylist went to that customer and asked her if she had anymore. It was awkward and scary. I silently said a prayer for her not to ruin my hair. Or to cut me. And I never went back. I was in limbo for a long time...one day while shopping at this JC Penny, I thought I really need a haircut, so, in I went. It was a good move! My stylist and I hit it off and I was super happy with the results. After a year or two, my stylist moved to a different state. But she recommended another stylist at the salon. Shahla. Let me tell you about Shahla. She's amazing. People compliment my hair every single day. She's like the hair whisperer. She knows what will look best and exactly how to make it happen. Listen to her! She knows what she is doing! Her coloring technique is top notch. Her cuts are perfection. I couldn't imagine not going to her. My hair is the best it's ever looked. And she tells you the truth...if I bring a photo in of what I want my hair to look like, she'll tell me how much work it will take to maintain it, like how often I'll have to come in for touch ups or how hard it might be to style it at home. And she'll also tell you if your hair just won't do that. There's nothing worse than a stylist who tries to give you a style that does not work with your hair type. One thing is for sure: I will follow Shahla wherever she goes...she is the best!",positive
Very nice JCPenney's. Great selection of clothing for big guys. The store was clean and every employee I encountered was friendly and offered assistance. Highly recommend!,positive
"I have been going to the Salon for the last 5 years! My hair girl, Shalah is the BEST! When I say best, I mean it! She always steers me right on my hair! I have never had a bad cut or color from her! She is fabulous! If you want someone who can help you get the best out of your hair, Shalah is your lady! Plus, she is always on time! :) Can't say enough about how much I love her!!!! :)",positive
"It took me a long time to get my husband to shop here instead of Casual Male XL. It's way more inexpensive, they always have sales, and the big and tall men's section is superb! Not to wild about the women's/misses clothing, but they have the cuuuutest shoes!",positive
"I really wish Yelp allowed to give a negative star rather than one. One star just seems way too generous, in my opinion. This review is for the Salon located at J.C.Penney. From appointment to final cut, my experience was HORRIBLE. I would have preferred hand my bulldog a pair of scissors and let her go to town on my head. First off, the girl that scheduled my appointment and my sister's appointment scheduled us for an hour and a half apart. I didn't agree to that, but whatever, a woman was there on her day off and they asked her to clock in. Unfortunately, she wouldn't stop remarking about how she generously clocked in. We each brought photos in for how our hair should be cut. Mine's not bad, but my sister hates her hair, the woman spent more time diagnosing her dry scalp than actually paying attention to my sister's reference material. I walked out of there with such an intense headache from the spots where my gal had burned my scalp with the blow dryer. I was never trained as a cosmetologist or an aesthetician, but isn't it common knowledge that you don't hold a blow dryer in the same spot for an extended amount of time?! After I told her about it, she apologized but then remarked that it was easier to just get the root dried first. Does somebody have the number for Tabatha? I'm done, apparently J.C.Penney salons are now the skill equivelent to Super Cuts with more money tacked on at the end. Yeah, I'm angry that I could have paid $14.00 and gotten a crappy cut somewhere else.",negative
"I went here today and found cargo shorts like I was looking for. The store didn't have very many shoppers and it was easy to look for what I wanted, find that indeed they did have what I wanted, try it on, and then check out all within 15 minutes of entering the store. Since there were so few shoppers, parking was a breeze and I was near the one entrance. The store is undergoing some renovation. There are several areas blocked off with plastic walls and they're doing work inside. I'll have to come back and see the improvements. I've been to this JCP before and it's very convenient to where I live. I'll be back.",positive
"Awesome customer service. I had to return a few items and one didn't have a tag (it must have broken off or something). I did have the receipt and there were absolutely no issues about getting a refund, etc.",positive
"I've been shopping at Penney's forever! I grew up on the catalogs and enjoyed shopping with my mom as a child. We could always relied on quality. Now the concept of a free standing store isn't new, it's recent return is the best idea they have had in a long time. I like parking just outside the door, walking in and shopping, then when I am done, walk out to my car and move on to the next shop on my list, or head home. I don't like walking malls, and putting up with crowds. I don't think I have seen the store really busy, during the holidays, and weekends, I have seen a little bit more than usual crowds, but lines aren't long at check out. I have found some really good gift ideas, and since they have big and talls, found some things for my really big and tall father! Love JCP!",positive
"This review is for the hair salon. I've been coming here for quite some time now. I first met Janelle at Hair Experts and followed her here. After a few years of getting my haircut from her, she moved, and I was introduced to Shahla. Shahla is wonderful! I've gone to many hair salons but never this satisfied. I never complained about my haircut. She spends her time with me and my daughter. My daughter is very pleased with the way she cuts and styles her hair. Shampoo, cut, and style are all included with the price.",positive
"Hanging a ""Customer Service"" sign over the cash registers does not magically transform your cashiers into a Customer Service department. So imagine my dismay when I went to ""Customer Service"" to inquire about fitting rooms because I couldn't find any sales associates on the floor and still had to wait for 2 groups before me to checkout.",negative
"Why does a transaction take seven full minutes? I'm buying boxed jewelry -- I'm not applying for a mortgage. I've visited this JCP several times over the last few years when I needed to buy some gifts or necessities. Every time, I've waited a good five minutes in line and another at least five minutes waiting for the cashier to ring up my purchase. I've also filled out the JCP survey (from the receipt) every time and described the incredibly slow experience. When I have to go into this JCP, I intentionally rush my shopping and searching because I assume I'll be spending the majority of my time in the store standing at the checkout.",negative
This is probably the best JCPenney in Madison. Great help from Tracy and Heather tonight from jewelry department. they have a lot of great products!,positive
"I've read about how poorly Penney's is doing, and I hope they can get it together because I like this place. I really like their exercise wear (I found these fantastic running bras for less than $20!!) and they seem to always have lots of stuff marked down. They also have, at least in the women's section, quite a few dressing rooms, which I LOVE. I discovered their ship-to-store option and am a fan. You find your items on the website (there are reviews for most things, also appreciated), order and pay for them, and have them sent to the Penney's of your choice. If you get more than $25 of merchandise they ship to the store for free. You waltz in to any register and give them your info (you need your phone number and the credit card you used, if I remember right), then they get on the walkie-talkie and have somebody bring your bag/box to the register. I recommend not going during a super-busy time if possible, but otherwise it didn't take long at all.",positive
"Have any of you been to JCPenney recently? WOW! It's on the up! First of all, the new pricing policy is great. Three tiers: 1) standard price, 2) month-long specials, 3)markdowns straight to ""best price"" - so if you see something with the red tag you know that it's the lowest it'll be. And, wow, they are going low. I got my little cousin 5 shirts, 1 skort, and a pair of jeans for $17 2 weeks ago for her birthday. Yes, kids clothes are cheaper than adult clothes in general, but this was just a steal. Last night I found a pair of M-N-G (Mango) jeans for $5. FIVE DOLLARS! And they're doing a total remodel of the store and have already installed a really fashion-forward jeans department featuring Levi's products (which, sadly, have never worked for me - but it's still a well designed department) and a really wonderful, if a bit small, shoe department. Fashion-wise, having lived in Europe for 3 years I can say with confidence that the M-N-G line that Mango is doing for Penney's is sometimes even better than the stuff in their standard stores in the UK and Europe (I kept noticing this on trips to the US). They've also got other designer collaborations and seem to be trying to compete with the fashion-forward nature of Target, etc. while keeping hold on the more traditional department store branding as well. Since moving back to the US in the Spring, I've been shopping more at Penney's that I had in probably the 5 years before I left. This location and the West Towne location are really making great strides.",positive
"Two stars for excellent pricing on eyewear and a pretty good selection. No real 'names' so if you're looking for Coach sunglasses, move along. I needed new glasses, so prescription in hand I went shopping for frames. Actually, I found JCP Optical by accident, didn't know they even HAD an optical center. Found a great pair of frames and a great price, handed over my RX and completed the order. SImple, huh? Not quite. It took THREE tries and FOUR WEEKS to get my eyeglasses. Apparently, their glasses are made in New Jersey by blind elves who lack the ability to grind glass using sophisticated machinery. Many phone calls and much ado ensues, finally I receive my glasses no less than 30 days from the date of order. That was frustrating, but to their credit, they gave me half off the final price.",negative
"I recently went to the Sephora inside this JCPenney and Candace here was such a great help. She not only made the return process easy (I bought a NARS foundation that I ended up hating) but she also got out of the register to help match me and grab a sample of a new foundation, mind you there was only 2 employees working that Sephora and a lot of customers! She was very professional, listened to me rant hehe, and was very helpful! Would highly recommend coming here again!",positive
"I don't even want to give this JCP store in Goodyear, AZ 1 star!! It is by far the worst looking JCP store I've ever been in. My husband worked for the company for 38 years & we retired in AZ. The Goodyear store is the closest to us. I used shop in JCP all of the time, no more!I've been in lots of JCP stores, as we've moved 6 times & my husband used to be a secret shopper in the stores. It doesn't seem like this store is ever recovered at all, what does this store manager do?!! He certainly doesn't manage his store or motivate his people to make this store look the way it should. I'll shop at Kohls, I don't like it as much, but at least it's neat looking whenever I go in.",negative
What happened to Penny's of the past?? This place is now an absolute dump! My wife and I went into JCP about a week ago looking for blouses for her; you would have thought a tornado hit this place. This place is as bad as Kmart or even worst. I don't know what their strategy is but it's not working. I think if they keep this up the writing is going to be on the wall for an already struggling JCP. Will go to Kohls instead. Good luck JCP.,negative
This store is by far the messiest I have ever seen it! I can't even stand to shop there anymore! Went in today. No more! Clean it up or or hire someone who can! This is awful!,negative
This is the best Salon in Goodyear. All of the Stylists are friendly. I love getting my highlights there. Great atmosphere.,positive
What's the point of giving us coupons that we can't use. I went to JCPenney today just to be told that here's $10 but you can't use it on anything.,negative
This store is a complete disaster. The jean tables are completely destroyed you can't find sizes or styles. There are table and displays with piles and piles of shirts with no rhyme or reason. You can tell what's on sale and what's not. I used to shop here all the time and was always satisfied but I don't think I'll come back. One of the most disorganized stores I have ever been into. I will take Ross anyway over this store. They need to take some pride in their store.,negative
"We finally purchased our washer and dryer from the JCPenney appliances department. Our sales clerk was great, very helpful. We even signed up for the JCPenney card to save even more money. I have always liked JCPenney. We will continue to recommend and shop with JCPenney. The installation and delivery company that they use is awesome too.",positive
THE messiest JcPenny store I have ever been to. I expect the clearance section to be a little messy. But the entire store has just shelves with piles of clothes rolled up into balls and clothes thrown everywhere. We were so annoyed and didn't feel like digging through stuff to find anything so we left.,negative
"I just have to say, I'm SO disappointed in how this store looked. I know it's the day before Mother's Day but there's NO reason walkways should be blocked with boxes, open boxes of toys and trash?! Not to mention piles of clothes on the floor around every corner. I worked here in 2013 and my manager then would never let it get THAT bad. I didn't even buy anything, it was too difficult to find what you were looking for.",negative
"I've always had a good experience with JC Penney salons but not this one! The stylist was late, did not listen to what color I wanted for my highlights & did her own thing. It took her 4 hours to do my hair & I walked out with basically the same hair color that I walked in with. I got married the next day and was very sad & disappointed with how my hair turned out. Horrible experience! I will not go back!",negative
I was at the store last week. Walked around and waited fir a rep to help me out. 1 was busy with a client and the other young Hispanic girl was pretending she was busy but she was actually flirting with an off shift coworker. Every time I went by her she would start arranging products and acting as she was looking for something in particular. I was watching her. She then would start talking to the guy but he was not really paying too much attention to her. Bad customer service. I was very disappointed. Sephora is supposed to be a high class high quality store but hire lazy mediocre staff.,negative
"We purchased several appliances from the appliance department through the very nice and very helpful Aaron. I would recommend him highly. I am actually reviewing their delivery service and the installer Jorge who has no understanding of the concept of politeness. We paid an extra 90 dollars for delivery and installation with the understanding that the installer could work with any situation, including a new kitchen. Jorge refused to do any work today because he did not like the way our kitchen vent was configured even though it was correctly and professionally installed. He actually tried to take our merchandise back. My husband then called Irene, his boss and also got little sympathy. We now are in possession of appliances that are not hooked up, even though they could be, just because Jorge went on a power trip and Irene gave him the fuel to do it. We were going to purchase a new refrigerator from Penney's this week because we were so happy with Aaron (our salesman's) service. Now thanks to Jorge and Irene we will be looking elsewhere. No wonder JC Penney's is going the way of countless other failed retailers.",negative
This jcpenny is not too different on the outside or interior at first glance but one you take a good look at it its like an different story what perticularly interested me was that it had a different setup than most other places that ive seen also it has a few things that other stores have so it deserves a four star rating.,positive
"You can't even walk into this place, it's so dirty and things are thrown all over the place. When I overheard an associate talk to another associate about the store they said well it's a never ending battle and why clean up. Totally not the attitude to have about the place you work. I guess I'll have to drive to arrowhead when it's a little more upscale then walking into this dirty place, I feel Walmart is probably cleaner then this place.",negative
I was in earlier in the day and it was absolutely nuts so I places some items on hold. Looked at the website for some coupons and found a sweater. Called the store to see if they had any in stock. Can't remember whom I spoke with. But she said she would hold both color options at the east register. Went back now and they couldn't find it anywhere. I very nice cashier walked me through the store and came up empty. I wish I would have gotten her name. We found similar items someone placed on hold with out a name but it wasn't what I was looking for. But she was super nice! We found a associate named Madeline and after her searching for almost 20 mins SHE FOUND MY ITEMS! They weren't even on the floor and she still found them. I am so happy!,positive
Prepare for checkout lines worse than Disneyland. Some people start waiting in line as soon as they arrive to reserve a spot while family members shop and then join them in line. Rediculously long lines means it will be a long time before I try this store again,negative
As soon as you walk in this store the stinch begins! This store is super dirty and the shoe department is s joke! The place is turned upside-down and needs seriously cleaning. The employees act like zombies no one knows nothing. Jcpenny has no internet service in store and the wi-fi is also a sad joke! Never going back.,negative
"This is a nice, clean JCPenney. The employees here are friendly and helpful. I like that this location isn't in a big shopping mall - it's in a strip mall.",positive
Pretty stress free experience at Penny's. Went with my husband and toddler looking for some new clothes for the two of them. Great prices and the cashier gave us an additional 15% off after helping me locate a coupon online with my phone. Will definitely be back to do some shopping for myself later.,positive
"Writing this review for salon services. I went in two weeks ago to fix a lightening session I had done twice at a different JCP location. I was assigned to Carmen. Let's just say she knows what she is doing! I wanted a balayage done. The previous stylist messed the whole thing up but Carmen fixed my hair! I am thankful that my hair was left with little damaged done because of her! She is nice, patient and understanding. I'd definitely recommend her if you want to go lighter/ombré/balayage!",positive
The system needs change. JCP in my opinion changed to mirror Kohls. I had to order two items as they did not have the selection of sizes available in boys clothing. I ordered them but had to pick up in store for free shipping. When I picked up the items I had to wait 20 minutes due to their service desk had not enough sales reps. They allowed the customers who were returning items to go look for another item while they kept the register on hold. Poor system.,negative
"It has been a while but I'm back now. I use to shop at JC Penny often but stopped when the sales started decreasing. I'm happy to say the sales are back and so am I. I thoroughly enjoy the shopping process (both offline and online) at JCPenney. The in-store customer service reps are incredibly helpful, and I find the online shopping experience easy to navigate and I usually find exactly what I am looking for. It's not always easy to find a retail experience online that makes you feel confident and secure with uour purchases as JCPenney's does. If you haven't been to JC Penny in a while I would recommend you visit the stire or online.",positive
"The salon here is amazing- ask for Quinton!!! He turned my dead yellow knotted terrible hair into what I wanted but even better and made it healthy and took so much care time and effort to invest in making it perfect... I've never been into a salon and got what I was hoping for, but I walked out and felt amazing and got even better than what I thought could be done with my hair- freaking love it and I freaking love quinton!",positive
Being bigger muscled guy I need a Big and Tall section and they do have one but be prepared to be limited with selection. They have bigger items that fit in the shoulders but unfortunately they seem to all be sold in tall as well as big. I was able to find a XXXL sweater that was not to long though and it was a good price.,positive
Yay! Sephora is finally here!! This is the only reason I decided to return to JcPenney. I was pleasantly surprised that things have once again been changed to include sales. In fact it seems that the whole store seemed back to normal with sales and clearance. I may actually start shopping here again.,positive
"They do have some really cute stuff, but this whole new pricing thing...it blows. Things were so much more less expensive before... However, if they'd follow suit with other JCP's and add a Sephora...I'd be there weekly!",negative
Holy after-Christmas madness. Kohl's puts this low end department store to shame. I found nothing I liked. Don't go here unless you're paid in cash every other Friday and have a family of 7.,negative
We're out of state from Colorado my boyfriend wanted to buy a suit in Vegas looked him up on line went inside and the atmosphere was purely amazing helped us right away we actually ended up leaving with 4 suits! He's such a nice man very funny homey would recommend this place to anyone in Vegas 100%!,positive
"This afternoon I walked into Jacobi's to see if anything grabbed my attention to spruce up my work suit collection. I was immediately greeted by the owner himself. He was able to help me and work the entire store to make sure all of it questions were answered. He could tell my size by looking at me and he explained the suit special. I was very impressed with the selection, quality, and service. I used their tailor, who is as sweet of a person as they come. I walked out knowing I got a great deal, thank you sir! Highly recommend!",positive
"I went to Jacobi's last week to buy some new suits for my new job. From the start I told Jacobi I didn't want the $299 special, I was willing to pay $499 for the wool suits since I didn't want polyester. I ended up buying 4 suits for $670 (with the 4 shirts, 4 ties, 4 socks, and 1 belt). Imagine my surprise today after I picked up my suits and got them home to see there's not 1% wool in any of the 4 suits. All 4 are 65% Poly 35% Rayon. Not only did Jacobi sell me the special I specifically told him I didn't want (the poly blend) he then charged me the wool suit price! BUYER BEWARE",negative
Jacobi is really friendly and helpful. He didn't push any suits on me or push to upsale on more expensive Suits. One of the deals is 3 really great quality suits with a shirt/tie/socks for each suit for $500.00. One of the suits cost $900.00 elsewhere. Another deal was 3 suits for $300.00 including a shirt/tie/socks for each. Hands down this is the best place to find a top tier quality suit for a low price and excellent customer service.,positive
"I needed a suit and I was leaving Vegas the following day. I googled suits in Vegas and found this perfect spot. They got me exactly what I wanted and were able to tailor the same day. Alice was personable, professional, and efficient. I highly recommend this store.",positive
"My favorite place to shop when in Las Vegas!!! Not only is the quality GREAT, but the staff is amazing and their prices are fantastic!! I have nearly my entire wardrobe replaced with Jacobi's apparel. My wife loves the 'new me'!! Don't waste your time at any other men's clothing store!",positive
"Stumbled upon Jacobi's Men's Fashions on google and it was the best thing that could have happened to us this week. Upon entering the store Jacobi himself was of great help in answering our questions and is very knowledgeable about sizes and fashion. Initially we went in looking for a suit for my father in law, whom past away just yesterday Monday the 26th, and my mother in law had a specific style, color and look she wanted to last see him in. We found it! He had a great selection. Jacobi was such a sweetheart and gave us a great deal for 3 suits, shirts and ties for my father in law (rest his soul), my husband and brother in law. He doesn't realize how much help this truly was to our family in this time of suffering, but we will forever be grateful and loyal customers. Jacobi has a wonderful personality and was a pleasure to talk to. God bless him.",positive
Jacobi's is by far the best place to buy suits. Jacob is not only professional with a keen eye for quality and taste in his products but his pricing is outstanding. It is very enjoyable to shop with him to fit you perfectly in the suit/suits and everything that completes the look. Great store very highly recommended. Tell Jacob Erin sent you!!!!,positive
"What an awesome place to go for men's clothing. Went in looking for a suit for a special occasion and was in an out in 20 minutes. Picked out a great suit, dress shirt, and two ties. Alterations were done perfectly and on time. Jacobi was awesome!",positive
"OMG!!! I walked in the store with my husband looking for a hat and end up buying some amazing suites, shoes and matching shirts. Real nice quality material. Jacobi helped us and his customer service is impeccable!! Don't waste your time at the mall. Must go to Jacobi first!!",positive
Jacobi's is awesome thank you so much Alice for the great and wonderful job you did I cannot believe it is you're like the Gordon Ramsay fitting everybody and anybody that needs a suit this is a must go place your time not wasted they can look you and measure up right away they're all professionals I recommend the 3 socks 3 shirts 3 jackets 3 pants one belt for $499 which i purchased. I took my son down there I took two Suits he got one. awesome awesome awesome. They will not waste your time there I've been to other places they try on so many different suits and stuff they didn't know what they're doing. Jacobis knows what they're doing please please go down there doesn't take much time if your father have two sons each get a suit 3 friends get a suit you can't beat the quality and price again Alice you are awesome thank you for the great service,positive
"After visiting the typical chain stores and not being able to find a suit that fits my broad shoulders (gym for 15 years), I was ready to go to a tailored place knowing I was probably going to pay $800 to $1000 for one tailored suit, but decided to stop by Jacobi's on a whim. I'm more than happy that I stopped by Jacobi's to take advantage of his 3 suits, 3 ties, 3 dress shirts, 3 handkerchiefs, 1 belt special for $500. More importantly, I was able to find suits that fit properly. Jacobi was there to offer great service and years of experience in this industry. As the owner of the store, it's going to be hard to beat his level of customer service. He was able to find great combinations of shirts & ties to match the suits, saving me time. No need to shop around going forward as this place has my business for life! I just wish I found this shop earlier in life. Jacobi was very kind in giving a birthday present to my son, who sacrificed a couple of hours for me, which probably felt like 5 hours to a 10 year old since it wasn't a toy store. Jacobi, I already have referrals going your way. Thank you for a great experience at your store, and needless to say, I'll be stopping by in the future.",positive
"Not my first time at this store but didn't have a chance to write a review before. This is the perfect place to shop for men and women. Came to shop for my boyfriend and I'm happy! Service is always great and friendly. Prices are better than anywhere in town and you're getting quality clothes. I love this place, all in one store :)",positive
The staff was amazing & very courteous. Alice took care of 5 suits with different fittings like a pro. I can truly say they take pride in what they do. They make us feel like family. I know for a fact we will look very sharp for my wedding coming up in January. I'd recommend Jacobi's to anyone & for any occasion. Thanks so much for your amazing hospitality!,positive
Excellent customer service...Mr. Jacobi has more than 30yrs experience in the field and willing to teach you the fine art of looking good in a suit. Pricing is reasonable if you are on a budget like me..,positive
"We were in and out of here in 15 minutes with 3 suits for my husband with shirts, ties, belt, & shoes to match that fit him perfect! The lady was very helpful & knew what she was doing. She knew his size just by looking at him and when he tried everything on it fit perfect. She was great at picking colors to match his suits & I would go back.",positive
"I'm an attorney so I have to wear a suit every day. I'd previously bought my suits from Joseph A. Banks and I looked like a schlub. I first came to Jacobi's and hesitantly bought a couple suits and it was like night and day difference, excellent style and great prices. At church that Sunday, my wife thought by butt looked good, I knew it was because of the suit. I came back in and bought 7 more suits the same style. I literally threw all my other suits away into the trash. I won't wear any of my old suits anymore.",positive
"My first yelp review and I am going to use it on Jacobi's. You will receive the ultimate in excellent customer service at the store. I walked in needing to purchase three suits. Jacobi walked me through the store and spent the time needed. While I was looking at a higher price point, Jacobi actually directed me to a lower priced line that looked on me. Oh yeah, forgot to mention that you get 3 ties, 3 shirts, 3 pairs of socks and a belt with the 3 suit special. Result? 6 suits purchased. Thank you!",positive
"I needed a suit for a meeting and got three suits, shirts, ties, socks, and a belt for what I was going to pay for one suit at the Hugo Boss outlet store. They have in-store alterations, and Jacobi has a real eye for style and fit. Couldn't be happier, and I will be back.",positive
"I shopped around for cheap yet good quality suits and this place us def the spot! Stopped in to get my man a couple suits. Alice immediately greeted us and started helping us gather suits in his size and choice of colors. Alice quickly started putting together different shirts and ties that looked nice with my man's chosen suits. We were given a couple of great options in which it was hard to chose as they all looked amazing together. Alice then added a belt and 3 pairs of socks. As he was being measured by the seamstress, I went to pay using a yelp check in discount offer. I am shocked how quick it was shopping for suits. Great customer service and my man is lookin like a million bucks This place is our new one stop shop for suits. & did I mention they were super friendly and great with my 2 year old son. Thanks for the great experience",positive
Best customer service ! Ive never had to wear a suit before and Jacobi was very knowledgeable and made the experience fun ! Thanks Jacobi for the beautiful suits !,positive
Amazing customer service! I am new with getting suits and Jacobis made it easy and very affordable! I recommend this place to anyone who needs to get a suit! They even have nice watches and other clothing options so I will be back! Great selection!,positive
"This place is amazing! :) we have our own wedding coming up and then my fiancé was requested to be in a wedding. When we went, we had already rented a tux from another place.. However when we got there, it turns out it cost less to buy the tux than rent it! The suits and tuxes were much nicer than the rentals, so I'd highly recommend it!! Plus, Jacobi is amazing and ara the tailor is great! Go now. !",positive
"Went to Jacobi's Couture to pick up a suit for an interview. When I arrived Jacobi himself was there, he showed me some great suits. I bought 3 suits which included 3 shirts, 3 ties, 3 handkerchiefs, 3 pairs of socks, and a belt for a great price! I told the tailor that operates in the back of the store that I needed the suits in a week. I went in 6 days later hoping that the suits would be finished and I could try them on for any final touch ups, unfortunately they were not. I went in the next morning and the suits fit perfectly. The tailor only takes cash and the prices were a little steep but was good overall. If the tailor would accept credit cards and was a little more affordable I would give 5 stars. The clothes are great and I will be going back very soon. Thanks Jacobi!",positive
My boyfriend has been all over town looking for suits but not wanting to pay an arm and a leg for them . We went to Jacobi's and he got five great suits for less than 800.00 . Besides having a great variety in mens suits the CUSTOMER SERVICE is top notch . I don't say this often because nowadays were lucky to get decent service when we go anywhere . The staff is knowledgeable and more than happy to help you find what you need a price range you're comfortable with . I would highly recommend going to Jacobi's to anyone that reads this review . Best in Vegas !!!,positive
"OMG, I really dont know how these guys are still in business. I bought a suit there (jacket, pants, vest, shirt and tie) and the shirt buttons started falling off not to mention the threads sticking out of every seam. its all made in china with cheesy Italian name labels (Giovanis, Fellinis, Raviolis and Fetuchinis). My pants had clip zips on the sides, it broke two weeks after. I couldn't wear them anymore and took it back. the attitude I got was so ugly (we already got your money and you are bugging us now). The lady there made me feel like I came to exchange a new Lamborghini. she had to call the owner and the manufacture and refused to replace it. she said she had to exchange it with the manufacture and call me in a few days. it was so obvious she was just blowing me off and didnt do a thing about it. I called two weeks after and her comical reply was ""Still waiting for UPS. try tomorrow"". WTF. it takes less time to ship a car from the other side of the world. do they really think people are that stupid?! These guys have no clue what customer service is. a simple exchange for a defected item that cost them maybe 5% of what they sell it for and you get an attitude like you, the customer, are in the wrong. They can keep the pants. I'm not gonna even waste my time with them anymore. but I'll be sure to tell everyone and anyone I know to stay away from that place.",negative
"On the hunt for what seemed like an impossible to find suit for our wedding, alas, we found it at Jacobi! My husband is not a tiny man, and the size he was looking for is not really common... plus he wanted to get married in an ivory (not common) color to top it off (but not too ivory that it looks yellow or cream but almost white)... Mission impossible? Not at Jacobi's. Sure, they only had one or two styles, and their shirts were a bit cheap, and their tie styles/colors a bit funky and reminded me of something Borat would wear, but who cares, we found his suit... and got TWO different suit colors because there was a buy-two deal! We upgraded from the cheapest buy-two deal so it wasn't the cheapest we could find, but it was the only place we were able to find what we were looking for with our odd uncommon requests. We were only in town for a few days so we needed to buy something off-the-rack AND get it tailored before we left. The seamstress stayed after hours and Jacobi was able to deliver before we left to travel back home however they hemmed the sleeves and pants a little too short. I told my husband ""I dont think you're supposed to expose your wrists or ankles that much"" but it was too late... the damage was done. And you couldn't really tell THAT much so we just had to deal with it. My advice is to hem it a bit longer than they recommend, because the lady will take too much off anyway. Overall pleased with everything though because if it weren't for Jacobi, we wouldn't be able to find our impossible-to-find suit anywhere else. Trust us, we tried. Minus one star for the too-short hem job and funky patterned selection of ties and shirts.",positive
Mr Jacobi happenned to be at the shop the day we went in. He is a super cool guy and was extremely helpful with our selections. My friend picked out 5 suits that were bad ass for 1100 and that was with shirts and ties and everything! I have to say I would go back only if he was there. He's a total rockstar and love the owner!,positive
"The staff at the downtown location tend to be rude. I walk in wearing their own higher end suits and am treating as if I am bothering them. I was considering using them for tux rental, but when they were unwilling to allow those who would be wearing the tux to simply get measured before the tux COLOR was chosen that was it for me. I was told ""its too difficult to change colors in our system"". I decided to call the online store and they told me the store associate was wrong and that they could definitely get me set-up for the tux and I could call back with colors. It was too late and we decided to go to Tuxedo Junction. I have shopped at Jos A Banks locations for about 8 years now. The service has greatly decreased and is at the point where I don't have any interest in visiting a store; especially the downtown location. They rarely provide quality customer service. On another occasion I went it to get measured to send my measurement to my cousins suit retailer for his wedding. Being a customer of the company I didn't think this was such a big ask. I was hurried over to a coat and that's all they would size. They would not get the tap measure out and seemed annoyed when I asked to try on a different size jacket in a different style.",negative
"Called the store to ask about sales event, salesman pretty much tried everything to not have me come in. Store hours are incorrect on the website. It was fortunate I called in to confirm the hours, I guess. Called the Ross Park location... Much better experience. Will be going there. The salesman seemed to actually want to help and earn my business.",negative
"I called to inquire about a tux rental for my wedding and the person on the phone had awful customer service. He was rude, impatient, and apparently didn't want to make a sale. Looks like I'm getting my tux rental elsewhere.",negative
"Terrible tuxedo rentals! I went here 2 months before my good friend's wedding to get sized and order my tuxedo. The salesman who measured me did not know what he was doing, continued to ask someone else if he was 'doing it right' and made me extremely uncomfortable. At the moment I wanted to give him the benefit of the doubt that he would get it right. When I picked it up, it did not fit!! They go through a third party and did not have an easy way to remedy the situation. They had to ship a replacement to where I was going since it was an out of town wedding. I had to return it to another Jos. A Bank store because I did not want to go back to the RPM location to see the guy that fit me originally. When I returned I wanted to see what they could do for my extreme amount of inconvenience and they hassled me when I wanted a refund! I was going to use them for my bridal party tuxedos next year, but no way now. All the employees there just said they go through a third party so its no wonder their rentals are not easier! Ha! POOR EXCUSE FOR A GENTLEMAN'S STORE. Oh, and its very very expensive! However, Jack from the RPM store was very kind and helped to make a bad situation better.",negative
"My husband Rick likes this store for his business wear and some of his sports wear. He likes that there are salespeople here who actually wait on him, fit him, and make recommendations. He also likes the dress shoes here. We bought his last suit here on sale. It was originally $550.00, on sale for $199.00. And I gotta tell ya, it fits him so well and looks so good on him! I love being seen with my guy when he's wearing that suit! I work pretty close to the Downtown location, and since they're having a sale, he asked me to pick up a couple of dress shirts for him. The salesman there helped me pick out a couple of shirts that would go well with his suit. Yes, Jos. A. Bank's is a little more expensive than many places. Indeed, it is quite a bit more expensive than Target or Walmart. Y'know what though? You get what you pay for, and my guy is one of those who'd rather pay a little more and get clothes that look good on him, especially for business. He's one of those guys who wants his clothes to be well made and to last.",positive
"When the shoes for which I was looking weren't available at the Christown Journeys, the staff there located a pair at Arrowhead. When I arrived, I found the shoes I wanted but realized they wouldn't work with the outfit I'd picked out. Fortunately, there was another pair of Doc Martins available for an incredibly low-low price. The associate initially was looking at other locations to see if she could find my exact size (the remaining floor model ended up being only a little too big), but I insisted on getting the shoes there. She gave me a discount because the shoes were floor models, plus I had a coupon for $5 off. Color me crazy for walking out with a new pair of Docs for under $15. Werd.",positive
Be careful. This place sells used shoes. Unbelievable. I went in to get my little sister shoes for school. The lady brought out a pair that were scuffed on the sides and the front had a chunk missing from it. So I told the lady if they had another pair. She brought out another pair which were in better shape. You could tell they had been used as well though because there was a heel print Inside both shoes. Never will go back to this place.,negative
Husband found a great pair of new balance shoes and the customer service was great! The girl working there gabbed a lot of different styles and made the experience easy for us,positive
"Dani helped me out. She was super friendly and helpful. The store didn't have my exact size in a shoe that I wanted to purchase, so she gladly called around to multiple stores to find the right one for me. I appreciate the customer service at this location.",positive
"I am so please with the level of customer assistance I received at Journeys #917. A huge shout out to ZOE, who assisted me and my little girl with sizing and fitting of a pair of white low cut Converse shoes. Zoe went the extra mile to recommend socks which were cheaper and more durable than name brand socks. Zoe did not pressure for sales, she did however suggest we ""check out the in store sale items."" I only wish my shopping experience involved associates like ZOE. I will be a return customer, thankyou ZOE. Willa Smith of Holbrook, Az.",positive
"Awful customer service. I came up to the counter with a pair of shoes to exchange and both girls were lacing shoes, looked very annoyed that was bothering them and after an awkward silence one finally said ""hi"" without eye contact and an attitude. One of the girls was very vocal and made it obvious that they didn't have the pair of shoes I was looking for. However she approached this with ""nope. No. No we don't have those"" and walking away. The whole experience has made me want to never return to this store which is unfortunate because I love it normally.",negative
"These guys charged more to sharpen my scissors, than I paid for them in the first place, which I pointed out when I went in to pay for the sharpening. They basically said ""too bad, that's what we charge"" The scissors are now worse than they were when I brought them in. Terrible service and unfriendly staff! I don't see the point of going back, I strongly recommend that you find a better spot for your sharpening needs.",negative
"Kent of Inglewood is a combination barber shop (complete with waxed mustaches on the stylists), men's grooming supplies shop, and a knife (including straight razor) shop. It's an uber macho/classy/cool place to walk around, my only regret being that it really was time for me to get a haircut. And an old-fashioned shave on top of that? Why Not? Instead, I gravitated to the knives and spent a lot of time looking through it all. That included a neat collection of shaving blades, including a Japanese model from Knifewear across the street. The person at the counter mentioned that Kent of Inglewood offered lessons. I wasn't quite sure about that opportunity. I eventually found a cool little Japanese fixed blade at a reasonable price, but still wondered what I left behind. I know that this was a great place because as I was leaving, I circled back 3 times to take another look. Let's hope I get another chance to find my way back to Calgary and end up here again. And with an open mind and gift list.",positive
"Bought myself a straight razor here, and the staff were extremely friendly and knowledgeable. They were willing to answer all my questions and were willing to teach this novice how to use a strop and the straight razor. I have had the razor for 6 months now and it has been great. If you are looking for a razor this is the place to go.",positive
"A visit to Inglewood is simply not complete without stopping in at Kent of Inglewood. I was first introduced to this shop through a Yelp Elite event and I've been a fan ever since. I somehow thought that shaving accoutrements were only relevant to fellas. Well since trying out a yummy shaving souffle I can say I my stems have not had a closer shave in their life. The upside is being fair haired and minimally fuzzy I now shave even less often with the use of this lovely shaving souffle. At Christmas it was hard to stick to my budget as I wanted to pick up nifty and yummy selling stuff for all the fellas in my life. The staff are friendly, incredibly knowledgeable and definitely no pressure on sales. They use the products themselves and can speak to their performance from first hand knowledge. I like that! They are fantastic members of their community as shown by their participation in the window decorations for the holidays. If I recall correctly they won the competition. They also put out a calendar for charity which was slightly racey and even more fun. Love guys with moustaches and beards who have a great sense of humour. Do yourself a favour, check it out!",positive
"Kent of Inglewood is an awesome store! If you're looking for a battleaxe, you probably won't find that here, but there are plenty of actual axes it that's what you're into. They also have razors, seriously high quality razors. It's definitely worth having a conversation with them to find a great shaving tool. They certainly know what they're talking about. For me, I got a safety razor and have settled on Feather blades, but as they'll tell you, it's a highly individual thing. They have exemplary products and customer service. It is well worth a visit no matter where in Calgary you live.",positive
Limited selection coupled with outrageously expensive prices on mainstream shaving gear. Shop online for best selection and prices. This place is not worth anyone's time.,negative
"I'm learning that a man just doesn't wake up one day and find himself with a luscious lady-slaying set of fur on his face. If they found a magic tonic that could do this, I would imagine it'd be an instant Nobel price winner, over some research done on cancer or whatever. I'm currently in a quest to reach the highest mustache and beard potential, a.k.a. The Nu-Manchu and it's been a hard journey. Everyone's been calling me Manny Pacquiao which I suppose is better than someone getting pest control to catch the muskrat growing on my lips. Which led me to my visit to Kent of Inglewood, a men's grooming and shave shop. It's not a store dense with shelves of product, but they have a lot of selection depending on what you're looking for. In this instance I needed something to soften the scruff, but accentuate the ferocity of my Nu-manchu. I had no idea what I was talking about or needed. Lucky for me, they were helpful enough to let me know on the things I'll need and were reasonable with what I should spend on and don't need to spend on. There were even some encouraging and inspirational words letting me know that ""you're almost there, you're on the right track."" And this coming from someone who had the jaw of Earnest Hemingway? #inspired #staythecourse #amoveablefeast Sure the products might be a bit pricey, but for the knowledge and the quality, it's more than reasonable exchange of value. One could walk into a supermarket and opt to slap on women's hair product on your face, but I'm quite sure women won't make out with a guy who smells like their girlfriend's scalps.",positive
"I absolutely adore this store. They have amazing clothing that works for a large variety of body types, not just one. The clothing is of extremely high quality and design. They offer styles mainly from the 50s and 60s, though I have seen some styles that look more 40s before. The service here is PHENOMENAL. Some of the best service I have ever gotten. This is the place I go for all the fancy dresses I might need! And let's just get back to the quality of these dresses! I have beaten the ever loving crap out of my dress and it still looks just as good as the day I bought it (though being rough on clothing provides different experiences for all, you've been forewarned.) This store will forever have my loyalty. I do not plan on going to any other place for retro clothing. Ever. Thank you Kitten Retro for being my store. Thank you also for giving me some confidence back. For a long time I would try on dresses in stores and they make me look lumpy. I am a curvy girl and I put on the dresses here and they fit like they were tailored to me and make me look fantastic. Thank you thank you for being so amazing.",positive
I was window shopping while waiting for my hair stylist. An adorable dress in the window caught my eye. After my appointment I popped in to try it on. I have never felt more welcomed then I did walking into Kitten. Jennifer the owner was there and was one of the most delightful people I have ever had the pleasure of meeting. The clothes are extremely adorable and affordable. The dress I bought was exactly what I was looking for and fit like a glove. There were so many adorable things. This vibrant boutique is a must try.,positive
"Kitten Retro Glamour is the best shopping experience you'll have in the valley. Pimms and her staff are wonderful and make shopping fun. Everyone is always smiling and eager to make their customers happy without the pressure of making a sale. Going here is like playing dress up- see a unique design? Try it on. See something that looks odd and that you know you won't purchase, but you're curious to see how it looks anyway? Try it on, you may be surprised. The clothing is adorable and there's always something new to be found. I love that the store includes jewelry and accessories from local artists. Be sure to check out the handmade dessert necklaces! The first time I checked out Kitten, I was at the Melrose location. While I was shopping, a trans woman walked in the store and Pimms greeted her with the same enthusiasm as all of her other customers. The woman tried on a few outfits and Pimms clapped her hands with excitement and made her feel welcome. Kitten does not discriminate and embraces everyone. I already loved the clothes and the shopping experience, but seeing Pimms interact with the trans community made me a fan for life. Yes, the clothes can be pricey, but bear in mind that this is a boutique that carries clothes from all over the world. The prices are comparable to a site like Modcloth, Sourpuss, Pin Up Girl Clothing, etc., but you are able to try on the clothes in the store and don't have to deal with pesky shipping fees. Better yet, Kitten carries a variety of sizes, from XS to 3X! Vintage sizing can be a pain, but the staff is extremely knowledgeable and helpful. If your size is not available or out of stock, the staff goes the extra mile to special order what you need It's impossible to walk out of Kitten without an air of confidence and without catching Pimms' contagious smile. Kitten Retro Glamour is an absolute must for fans of all things vintage, pretty, and kitsch!",positive
Pretty cool boutique with lots of fun items! Was here during their grand opening in Old Town as they just relocated from downtown PHX. I think a bit more inventory will definitely do them good in the long run. They have a beauty bar now where you can get the complete vintage pin up girl look from head to toe! So fun!!,positive
"The owner of this store is hands down the sweetest human I have had the fortune of dealing with. I can't express my gratitude! Due to a shipping snafu, I had an issue I needed resolved, and Jennifer sprung into action. Not only has everything I purchased through here been gorgeous and promptly shipped, but Jennifer's willingness to fix a problem should be properly commended. I live in San Diego, and will still prefer to purchase dresses through here than in any local shop. Thank you lovely!!!",positive
"I love this place! The owner is super sweet and has a great selection of vintage inspired clothing and accessories. Her prices are great too! Make sure you check out her store, you won't regret it!",positive
Yes!!!! No more hunting through the Internet trying to find that perfect dress!! This is a gorgeous shop and the owner has great style & taste. She's super sweet and will help you find something you will love! I keep recommending Kitten to my glamorous girlfriends and not one has been disappointed. You won't be either!,positive
"My wife and I went here today. She was looking for something to wear for some maternity pin up pictures and was very happy with this store. The girl we believe that was the owner, was awesome. She was very helpful and attended to my wife fantastically. They had sizes big enough for a pregnant girl. My wife will definitely be going back after the baby is born.",positive
"I'm going to be honest. I've avoided this place since they opened in July because I was afraid of sticker shock. My fiance gets his haircut next door every month and I'm usually with him. Last weekend was the Pinup Pop Up event and I was getting antsy waiting around so I reluctantly went in to Kitten Retro Glamour expecting to be let down when I looked at the price tags. I TOTALLY wasn't! For vintage inspired QUALITY clothing, this place has some of the best prices I've seen! I found a brown faux fur stole that the owner generously placed on hold for me for a week so I could come back to try it on with my wedding dress and it was perfect! I plan on coming back after the holidays to try on a few other items! Kitten Retro Glamour won't let you down!",positive
This little shop is absolutely adorable and spot on!!! Love love love this place!!! The owner is so sweet and welcoming!! Can't wait for more new items to arrive!! The clothing is of the best quality I have ever seen!! Not cheaply made as I have experienced from other stores.. I will def shop here and invest in this locally owned shop!!!,positive
Had a return and exchange at customer service. Murria seemed unhappy to help me and chatted with another associate about the missing Fitbit keys the whole time. And when my exchange ring up a different price than the rack it was wrong she didn't check. She just basically said I was wrong. I'm glad I don't have a Kohl's card. 2 stars because the products at kohls are good quality.,negative
"What great Customer service! I knew the day I let my wife talk me into opening a Kohls' account I would regret it. So a payment is over looked, they are so nice to call and inform you of the oversight after they report you late to the credit bureau. BOYCOTTED for LIFE!",negative
"It sure would be interesting if Kohl's would have more than ONE register open !!! No wonder there are very persistent rumors that Kohl's is on the verge of bankruptcy ! If I could give zero stars, I would....",negative
This store is very disorganized in its clothing section. Good luck finding the correct size considering the size on the hanger does not match the clothing or tag. It is taking longer than expected to purchase what I need.,negative
The store is almost empty and yet you can't get anyone to wait on you. They look the other way when they think you might need help or else they say they are going on a break. How they continue to stay open is beyond me. They don't have any good deals like they did years ago and they have poor quality merchandise. Customer service is non-existent.,negative
"This place is so huge! All female wears are on the left side of the store and men wears are on the right. Kitchen accessories are in the back of the store. Jewelries/accessories/purses/sportswear are located in the middle. Overall, the store is relatively organized and staffs seem helpful and friendly. However, clothing styles are somewhat old fashion (or old school) and seems more suitable for customers from 40s and up. I was hoping to find good kitchen accessories at a good deal, but prices are somewhat similar to prices at regular store. Nevertheless, they do have good selections for what you might need. This store might not be for me, but I think it's good for general public.",negative
"I was so upset by the staff here!! They were RUDE and unhelpful! I asked a question to more than one sales associate and they responded back with short, curt answers and went back to complaining about their job and other employees. I will NOT return to this Kohl's!",negative
"I just had a fantastic experience here. I usually shop this kohls, and like it, but the clearance sale they are having now is unreal. $6 for a tek hoodie!?!? Yay!!! The store was super clean and organized. The girl at the register was super sweet and friendly and efficient ( I forgot to check her name). Then, after I checked out, I realized that I forgot to use one of my coupons. She directed me back to customer service where Hamid helped me. He was able to credit the money I was supposed to save from the coupon back to my credit card easily and was so pleasant about it. I love this store :-)",positive
"I like Kohl's. They have very good sales, and when you go with a coupon you can save a lot. I really appreciate the Kohl's cash. I've saved a lot when I go there. I like their selection of jewelery. I can always find a good deal at Kohls!",positive
Nice enough store. But there was no sales people to be found when I needed help looking for a specific item in house wares. Prices were decent.,negative
"I agree with dam near every review for this place. Employees look miserable, and by selling over priced items made by b list celebs like ""marc anthony"", they give the illusion of a great sale. There dress shoes are priced around 90, worth about 40, and hit ""sale"" for 59.99. Its very hit and miss when it comes to sizes, esp. At this location. It seems like theyre answer for everything is online delivery, instead of directing me to a store that has my size by doing a simple stock check. Then again how much can one really expect from a department store as old as jc pennys. There only saving grace is the coupon stacking that someone mentioned earlier. Most places restrict a single coupon per purchase, but ive stacked and left paying 25 bucks for a pretty decent pait of work boots. If you dont have coupons, id go somewhere else.",negative
"Make sure you signup for their email list, you'll get 20-30% off coupons each week, then it makes going here a great deal for name brand clothing.",positive
The service at this location is pitiful. Not one person smiled or even acknowledged my existence. I needed to make a return and made it through the entire store with no interaction. Once I made it to the customer service counter the woman was incredibly rude and said maybe two words to me the entire time. The only reason for the 2nd star is for how easy it is to return items at Kohls. Skip this location!,negative
"On black friday i had to work but got off in the afternoon and raced to 3 diff Kohls to get my sizes in these cool cashmere sweaters that were 100 bucks but marked down to 30.00....i was so happy, i think ALL the cashiers and dept people are real sweet at Kohls too, they are really nice on the phone and go get/hold a size for you then they even find another color to throw in for you...they take it a step beyond and the manager helps out too and they even told me to keep my 32.00 receipt when i get to the next Kohls so they can add it in and give me that 10.00 Kohl's cash since Im buying more and every 50 spent gives you a ten coupon...I LOVe the makeup line there called Flirty..lipstick colors nice, special white one called Angel and Cherub and the lip gloss has a thick brush so you can mix/spread your lipstick & gloss around prettily...so that reminds me, I need to get to Kohls this weeknd to get those other makeups I saw since the Kohl's cash does have an expiration date. Happy Shopping! I also like the Chaps brand there,,,its kind of a copy of RL and Talbot...its pretty. The new Kohls at 101- Northern is really interesting.",positive
My review here is very neutral. Well I was walking on Stephen Ave and I saw this store. Well I am in Calgary! This store will come handy during Stampede time. They have lots of Cowboy Boots. Lots of Cowboy Hats. Lots of Cowboy stuff. Friendly staff too.,positive
"Hooray for cowboys! This is the best place in Calgary to find cowboy boots weather you are new to the city or a country veteran. Tons of western wear available here, it isn't just cowboy boots! The staff are so friendly and willing to look up other locations that specific boots are available if their store doesn't carry them. I love that all of their boots are out in the open available for you to try on! Decent price for leather boots!",positive
"This year I had a different job at a new company that was going to provide me with the need to get decked out on an almost daily basis for Stampede. So, being the procrastinator that I am, off I went to Lammle's the day before it all started. OMG was it busy at this location! I was almost overwhelmed by the people, the line, the selection until I realized how quickly people were finding things and being helped. The line was moving really fast! I picked up a shirt and a hat in record time...they had a lot of choice in terms of styles and size - something everyone could feel comfortable in whether you are a conservative dresser or like to let it all hang out for Stampede (for the record I'm the former more than the latter). While some stuff seemed expensive to me, the quality is definitely there and the prices for clothing at least, were on par with some online sites I had been to. Bonus: They were collecting donations for the recent Alberta flood at the till and asking everyone in a classy, non pushy way. They were also very upbeat and friendly despite how insanely busy it was. I'll definitely come back to beef up the Stampede wardrobe...and perhaps not do it at the last minute.",positive
"There's a lot of Western wear stores to choose from in Calgary, but Lammle's is a traditional favorite. I don't think I've set foot in one of these shops since the last time I was on a horse, which was ages ago, so it was nice to revisit my equestrian and Albertan roots! Lammle's has a huge selection of everything: shirts, boots, jeans, hats, belts, and yes, tack. I only went in for a hat and pair of cowboy boots, and was totally overwhelmed by the selection -- but it was easy to find something I liked. The staff is very helpful, which I appreciated because the store was exceptionally busy as it was the first day of Stampede. I think the prices at Lammle's are reasonable because all their product is good quality, but you will find a range of affordable to expensive pieces depending on what you're looking for. I'll always be a fan!",positive
"I have purchased pretty much every stitch of my western wear wardrobe here. My cowboots? From Lammles. My cowboy hats? From Lammles. My very nice looking western shirts? Lammles. I've bought books here, I've bought jeans, I've bought bolo ties. I AM A FAN! Every time that I enter this store I am greeted in a very friendly manner. There are always enough staff on hand to help me out. I especially love the service from Michelle, a very bubbly complimenting gal! I'm on a first name basis with most of the staff, but if Michelle is working she's the one that is going to be helping me. So if you want tremendous service, selection and western hospitality you have to shop here!",positive
"There are visions synthesized in heads of fellow Canadians when you mention the city of Calgary. Indeed one of these associations must be the ode to all things cowboy/cowgirl, the Calgary Stampede. From what I have gathered from my time here, the Stampede appears to be some preserved tradition that celebrates the spirit of the city and its preservation has nothing to do with the dollars it brings in year after year into the city. In celebration of the wild west, some of us don our cowboy/cowgirl finest much to the delight of some and simultaneous chagrin of other Calgarians. For a long time I despised the cowboy theme. Perhaps it was because my roots belong to that rival city to the north where anything Calgary is shunned and despised. However, as one settles in this city and time flies by the next thing you know you start trying on western wear as a joke or for fun. More time passes and you begin to realize how comfortable cowboy boots can be and you find yourself at Lammle's eyeing the latest pair of python-skinned man boots and trying to justify the $250 price tag in your once logical mind. The selection here, and at most Lammle stores, is pretty amazing. Enough cowboy hats to supply a Stephen Ave confederate arm...er... police force. More pairs of cowboy/cowgirl boots than at a country and western bar. The service is great, pleasant and very patient. The price is ridiculous, but then again what do I really know about cowboys. Maybe this is the price that the market will bare, after all this is the wild west! However, I do know this. If you are looking somewhere fun to window shop or for great Stampede wear or if you want to look like Mantracker, Lammle's should be on your list of places to visit. 14/30 - Yelp 30 Day Challenge",positive
"This is my absolutely favourite place in the city to buy gifts and treat yoself (myself). Heidi and Nikki are two amazing owners who really strive to make their store unique and inspiring! With many Canadian-made options from jewellery, greetings cards, wine shhhhhtuff, shtuff for our men and even baby and pups! They host amazing events, and they are far too generous with their giveaways! Last Christmas they did 12 days of giveaways and at one point the giveaway was an amazing door mat!! Not only can you feel good that you are getting friggin cool accessories and unique items but you can feel good supporting two amazing women who's dream is to give Calgary and awesome boutique. Also, their Instagram stories and videos are worth getting up in the morning, trust me.",positive
"Calgary's East Village is an up-and-coming neighborhood. It's development has been slowed down by lower oil prices (the big industry in these parts), so who knows what this area will look like next year. In the meantime, there's enough construction here to imagine the possibilities. That includes the retail outposts like Liz & Lottie who have staked their success on their stylish taste and the promise of a lot more foot traffic past their shop. I wandered on a recent Friday afternoon and thoroughly enjoyed this version of retail therapy. Liz & Lottie is more geared perhaps to those who are ""sugar and spice and everything nice"", but for folks like me (e.g. snips and snails and puppy dog tails), there some interesting things, plus loads of gift opportunities. I also enjoyed their nice selection of local and Canadian items and their good taste in selecting and displaying their wares. Liz & Lottie was definitely worth the extra bit of East Village discovery exploration. Best wishes for your continued success.",positive
"Nikki and Heidi are my favs!!!! Also, their shop is amazing! Filled with the most current, trendy and ridiculously fun gadgets and gifts - this place is the perfect stop for the hard to shop for person. Also, the perfect place for everything you want yourself. It's tidy and perfect! If their witty Instagram doesn't pull you in - their amazing personalities will",positive
"Love this little shop, it's the perfect place to pop into if you need a gift for someone or your just looking at spoiling yourself! If your unsure of what this place has well a little bit of everything! It's great if your looking at adding some cool glass wear to your collection or needing a little oneise for a baby shower! The owners, Nikki and Heidi are amazing and super helpful! They picked out everything you see in the shop, and they have a great sense of humour added to the space and the pieces you can find. I have to control myself whenever I walk in because I want everything! The shops easy to get to right off of downtown, and they have PARKING right out front! I suggest you head down and check out the space, I'm sure you'll leave with a bag in hand!",positive
"You've gotta love a gift shop where you can go in and find beautiful things for everyone on your list (and a gift or two for yourself!) My super stylish and in the know sister in law has been finding awesome gifts at Liz & Lottie for everyone in the family since they've opened and I have been following them on Instagram to keep tabs on the new items coming into the shop. The two owners are super kind and helpful, I've messaged them on Instagram with shopping requests/items I am looking for and they have sent me back pictures of products they have in store that match the request -- how nice is that! I often visit on my lunch break as they are tucked into the East Village at the bottom of one of the high rises but it's easy to get there either from walking through the river walk, taking the train to the end of the free line then going for a short stroll or driving right up there. On this visit I walked away with gift for four upcoming events! A sassy and slightly inappropriate valentines card for my husband, a baby shower gift, a gender reveal party gift and a birthday party gift. Trust me I could have kept shopping! Great place to find all sorts of treasures including local and Canadian makers which is so great to see.",positive
"I love Longchamp, having first discovered the brand in Paris with a lovely little bag I owned for many years, and which I rediscovered recently with one of their beautiful leather totes. It's the perfect bag, honestly - well made, beautiful, and highly functional. Sooo when my friends and I walked by this store in Caesar's, I had to stop in. The saleslady was very attentive, and though I'm sure having a Longchamp bag slung over my shoulder didn't hurt, she absolutely noticed what I was looking at, noticing, and responding to, and so was incredibly helpful. I wanted a wallet, but slightly larger than my current one, and she immediately honed in on what my needs were and especially what colors I liked. When I had narrowed it down to two wallets, she could absolutely tell which one I kept coming back to - I wanted to like the pink, but I actually liked the blue more. I'm thrilled with my wallet and the color choice. I enjoyed the store experience overall and the sales help was first-rate. I cannot wait to stop in again. It's expensive, to be sure, but when you have the money for one of their items, it's a purchase that you won't regret.",positive
"The bad experience in this shop! The sales ignores when people walk in the shop and asking her details about bag. Finally, bought three bags from this shop. Thank you for your service!",negative
"Sadly, no awesome Asian-lady salesperson to help me. Got another girl who was very rude about my exchange. Gave me a funny look when I asked about an exchange and her tone assumed I was trying to exchange used merchandise. When I told her I just came back from another Longchamps store in another country two days ago, she quickly changed her tune. Considering I bought a total of 7 Les Pliages large bags, I thought she'd be a little lenient in allowing me to exchange two bags from last season; a fact not relayed to me by the salesperson in the previous store. I bought the bags for my siblings but a few of the colors didn't work out. Nonetheless, she was completely unsympathetic and treated me like I was out of place. It was quite offensive frankly, and I would have loved to just return the whole load with the way I was treated but their no returns policy was pointed out from the get go by the snooty salesperson.",negative
"I love Longchamp totes. Ever since I bought my first one 4 years ago, I can't ever use a different bag. It's light, roomy, stylish, durable, and very affordable. For about $150, it's an absolute steal. I've used my large Le Pilage tote as my: everyday purse, work bag, overnight bag, gym bag, laptop bag, travel bag, etc. basically, I use it for EVERYTHING. As a result, I was thrilled to see that The Forum has a Longchamp store! There are so many steps and colors to choose from! In addition, the customer service is top notch. The employees are friendly, helpful, and non-pretentious unlike the employees at some other handbag retailers at The Forum (*ahem* Louis Vuitton *ahem*). They also have a great sale section! I picked up 2 totes the other day for about $30 under the retail price. This store is definitely one of my faves in Las Vegas and that says a lot!!! Definitely a must stop spot out here!",positive
"Was window shopping while husband was at the casino. Came in to the store and was greeted by a pretty asian SA. She was very attentive, and very patient. I wasnt intending on buying another Longchamp (I have almost a dozen), but she was so amazing that I ended up buying a large le pliage cuir in pebble. Thank you Ms Yuko.. Youre amazing!",positive
I think the Le Pliage totes are overpriced but I was tickled to see that some of their Le Pliage totes were going for about $30 below retail which is nice because they are overpriced to begin with. This store is pretty nice. If I feel like dropping $200 on a purse or so I wouldn't mind going here. The atmosphere is quite pleasant.,positive
Service was great here. The asst. manager helped me and I could not be happier. I will place future orders from this location to be shipped to me. Thanks again.,positive
"True, how can a nylon looking bag can be so expensive...that's what I used to think about Longchamp bags. However, after seeing my friends carrying the bags for functional purpose, stuffing the bag with their laptop, books, etc, I decided that I want one for Christmas. I dropped by Longchamp store on Tuesday afternoon to exchange my Planetes bag for a size up. The staff were very helpful and friendly. It was a no-hassle exchange. The bag is very durable and serves more for functional use than for looks. When I am in need to a wallet, I will return. But for now, since the wallet is almost the same price as the bag itself, that can wait.",positive
"this store sucks! Customer service is severely lousy. I sent in my bag for repair but they said that the bag is not repairable and therefore it is throwable. The manager and the associate just emailed me and told me that they cannot replace it it is not repairable and I can call customer service and that is it. Now where is customer service there? No suggestions on what to do, no after care service. The bag is over rated to be durable and long lasting, I had mine for 2 weeks only and now it is for repair but actually it is for disposal since Longchamp does not want to fix their mediocre bag, what a disappointment!",negative
"I strongly dislike those canvas totes in the 'Le Pliage' line with leather trimmings that seemed to be a recurring trend around 09/10, another laughable way luxury companies tempt aspiring customers into their brand through the cheapest means possible. Since when is canvas luxurious? Ditto with their 'Ceci N'est Pas un It Bag' bags. They're cute, but I'd never spend more than $20 on one of them. Still canvas, Longchamp. I do, however, adore their leather goods. From experience, they're worth the price, and are a classic luxury purchase. Longchamp is one of the few accessory houses still family owned and operated. This brings you quality, and consistency over mass-market appeal, penny-pinching design and quality flaws. This location has excellent, unpretentious service. I heartily recommend!",positive
"this place deserves a negative review. Came here to get my folio case looked at because the glazing started peeling after only a month of use. The SA Anthony and some random manager looked at me and my case and told me that there was nothing wrong with it, even though there was clear cracking and peeling. I tried to explain the issues and showed them the cracking, to which they replied that it was normal wear and tear, and asked me what I wanted from them like I was looking for a freebie. I told them I just wanted to make sure that this wasn't a defect. Not the experience I was expecting from Louis Vuitton. I went over to the boutique at Wynn and they were much more friendly. They acknowledged my concerns, and agreed to send out my case for reglazing. The store at the Wynn is 100000x better.",negative
"I brought my Emilie wallet for hot stamp my initials, MISA was very helpful and friendly. She even call me later in the afternoon to ask me what colors i want for the Chinese logo that I choose. Very nice of her! I recommend her and of course i will make my future purchases with her.",positive
"Favorite LV location in Las Vegas. Super convenient to stop by and lots of merchandise. I met Misa here on my first purchase which was the Pochette Metis. I went in on random day trying to find a bag that was sold out everywhere and even had a waiting list (was the pochette mettis). Asked her if they so happen to have it, and she said ""as a matter a fact we do, we received one this morning"". My heart stopped for a bit of how excited I was. Talk about faith. From there on, I only shopped with her. Misa does a great job providing excellent customer service. She's super sweet and very honest which I love. Can't wait to keep my Louis Vuitton collection growing with her help.",positive
"Great service from the staff at this location. My wife and I visit several times a year and enjoy the knowledge and attentiveness the sales professionals provide. Some of the other reviews complain about the selection but there has never been any issue purchasing what we need regardless of where it is, they make things happen.",positive
"The experience in the store was short lived. I wasn't greeted when I entered, but that was not a huge issue. The main issue was the fact that my cousin and I were instantly degraded. We just got done with a quick work out and decided to look around the mall. We chose Louis Vuitton because I was planning on getting my mother a gift for the holidays. One of the sales associates was rude and was following us around the store as if we were ready to grab something and run. He barely spoke a word to us. After noticing that my cousin and I were actually interested, he asked, ""do you need help with anything?"" It was very quick and stern. As my cousin and I realized that we felt very unwelcome, we decided to head out without another word. Right as we left the store, I turn my head to see that the same sales associate followed us all the way out. It was a little humiliating and quite rude. But I'm not even mad though.",negative
I had a bad customer experience. Walked in and was barley greeted. All the employees were busy helping the few customers in store. I already had an idea of what I wanted to go in and get. When I got a chance to I asked the sales lady i wanted to look at the Neverfull MM in Damier and she got it for me and walked away for like 10 mins as I stood there waiting to be helped nobody approached me. When she came back I told her I was ready to cash out and she quickly cashed me out. I didn't get the 5 star customer experience I expected walking into a luxury store to purchase a high priced item. I understand that they might of all been a bit busy helping customers but the fact that nobody would acknowledge me or make eye contact to assure me that assistance was coming was very disappointing.,negative
Came in and didn't have the bag available in the color my mom wanted. Reserved the bag & was able to buy it a day later. Amazing service on both days I went. Very accommodating and quick. The staff was so friendly both in store and on the phone.,positive
Don't shop here!!! My daughter saved up her money And bought a bag here the first week of March. She had them ship her one to her house so no sales tax. Of course that one was not the one she looked at. We were on vacation for 2 weeks and she started carrying it last week and noticed it has a cut in the leather. She was devastated and crying! Customer Service said they would have the store manager contact her and set up an exchange. The store manager called her and said..no way...not exchanging...don't care how much money you spent! Pretty much accused her of cutting it...which she would so do so she could send back for the same purse in exchange...dumb a**!! I was getting ready to order myself another bag this week and I have such a bad taste in my mouth I will NEVER buy one again nor carry the ones I have!!! What happened to their reputation? Down the tubes......,negative
"The staff is super nice here, took time to show me different kinds of purses, I came in for a small handbag and found the perfect one! I'm in love!!",positive
"This store carries a wide selection of handbags and accessories to choose from. The staff are also very very friendly and helpful. I dropped by the store last night just to browse around and Jill Monzon was a great help. Unfortunately, I was unsure of the handbag I really wanted. But came back the next day and made the purchase with Misa. She was also very sweet and took her time with me. Overall, it's always a pleasure shopping at this Louis!!!",positive
"Terrible. Defective products. No customer service. I've purchased four bags and four wallets for myself and friends. These seemed beautiful and lifetime quality... at first. Several months down the road the Vernis finish on the strap of one of my bags started to peel off, then off the other bag. I brought the bags in and asked them if they could repair them or possibly replace the straps. They wouldn't do anything. They literally shook their heads at me. It was weird and awkward. Needless to say I don't go in there anymore and have nothing to do with that product. Terrible customer service. I even cringe when I walk past the store at the fashion show mall as it reminds me of this.",negative
"Not So.. ""Holly Jolly Christmas"" I decided to treat myself to a designer wallet after finishing up some last minute shopping Saturday 12.24.16 When I walked in I was given a ""My shift is almost over and I despise my job"" greeting from a young male associate. I asked the young man if he could direct me to the wallets and he pointed to the right and said over there. My immediate reaction was pretty shocked and surprised that he didn't escort me ""over there"" to the wallet section but none-the-less I found it. To my surprise after a short wait the same gentleman came over to ""assist"". I asked for a specific wallet (Josephine) and he pulled out two different wallets. Another sales associate interjected and directed him to the correct wallet. The display was the remaining wallet left and I asked if he could check an alternate location. The gentleman gentleman quickly responded, ""There's nothing wrong with this one."" I should have left the store at that point but the didn't. After checking the wallet for imperfections I decided to proceed with the purchase. The gentleman seemed a bit delayed and actually shared that his brain was fried today. After purchasing the wallet and waiting for him to deliver it to me the gentleman realized I didn't sign the receipt and circled back. Just when I thought things couldn't get any worse when the gentleman finally brought the wallet out there were police offices inside the store. Instead of asking his manager why the police were there he asked me, ""Why are the Po Pos here?"" I thought to myself this gentleman lacks professionalism and should be unemployed. I'm confident this young man would not have used slang if he didn't think he could ""get away with it."" Mr. Anthony Gomez you are by far one of the worst sales associates I've ever encountered. I recommend you take your job more seriously all the time instead of when you feel like it.",negative
"Quickly update for new arrivals,and giving nice services. Associates are really helpful and kind. I already looked up in online Louis Vuitton site,and told them I know what I want,and I was in bit of hurry. But they helped me really fast with professional services. I always visit this LV store. Better than other stores in Vegas!",positive
"Wow!! Yes, the service is excellent when you are BUYING not so much when their product fails bc of inherent defects. Adorable bags but they DONT stand behind their products. I have several LV accessories, and I took my bag in bc it developed a tear where the canvas naturally folded down. They refused to fix it telling me that a purse ""won't last forever""! It was 4 years old. How much do you think it ACTUALLY costs them to fix one of these cheap canvas based bags?! $25?? You are paying for the name, not the material!! Ummm excuse me, but I have lots of luxury items and they actually stand behind their products (Tiffany, Rolex, Chanel, Gucci, ssl, Tory birch, D&G). So, before you buy this brand, know that they will arrogantly deny fixing anything lest it happen within the first year of purchase- and only then if you are lucky. #lastLVpurchase #wasteofmoney #unsatisfiedLV #spendyourmoneyelsewhere if you want to be treated like a luxury client, or simply with respect, I highly suggest you seek products elsewhere. LV just doesn't offer the value it used to compared to other retailers, many of which actually HOLD their value.",negative
"This is my favorite Louis Vuitton location in Las Vegas. I shop here often and everyone is very friendly, attentive and professional. Love the selection and ease of walking in/out of store. I do not like walking past tons of tourists just to go shopping, I love being able to shop in peace. I truly love customizing my luggage pieces and my pieces always arrive on time, as promised. During one visit, I bought three luggage accessories for my luggages (they found at the Aria location) but brought it to their location on time for me. I appreciate their punctuality and commitment to their valued clients. Keep up the excellent service, I'll continue to purchase in this location.",positive
"This is my favorite LV store in Vegas! The staff is great and very accommodating especially Niko!! He always goes above and beyond to make sure I get exactly what I want, and does it with a smile and positive energy!",positive
"I'm officially done purchasing LV products after today! I went in for a repair on a purse and was told that because it had a crack that they could not repair the strap, rendering my purse unusable. It also took several times to even get a semi-logical explanation from the manager. Neither she nor the clerk was capable of explaining why it could not be repaired. The only logical response though would have been that they can try to repair it, but cannot guarantee the repair. Instead, I was told to take it to a local shoe repair shop. Done! I encourage my friends, sorority sisters, family, etc., to be aware that LV does not stand behind their products. Select a different ""luxury"" bag.",negative
This is one of the worst place I been too - I can't believe a manager at Fashion Show Mall - Karen Mesa - she was not willing to give any solution on a wallet that I spent over 400.00 dollars... When the thread is coming out! She was the worst manager for a high end retail company.,negative
"My husband suggested we visit this store so that we can scout out some purses for my potential birthday gift. I had a vague idea of what I wanted since I have kept up with the models, and have purchased from them before. (YOU'RE WELCOME MOM!). The store is relatively compact, yet has most of the popular models, sizes and patterns. We were greeted at the entrance and did not experience any snobbery from the staff. I do suffer from what the kids call RBF (resting b*tch face) so people do tend to think I am aloof. I was immediately approached and offered help. The lady helping me was very accommodating and patient. I had her showcase three different purses I was torn between, and even had her bring them out in different patterns and sizes. Pro tip: damier azur pattern tends to transfer color from dark outfits, especially denim. The stains/darkened patches cannot be removed or cleaned. It is something to consider if you're thinking of opting for that pattern. There was no pressure from the sales team to purchase anything on the spot, and I was glad I did scout out the bags in person because what I thought I wanted, I ended up not liking. I left the store with some enlightenment and a few new tips I was not aware of before. I would go back here to complete my purchase.",positive
"Absolutely horrible service! I went into exchange a pair of sunglasses I got as a gift. I wanted to exchange for a wallet because my parents have gotten me sunglasses for the last 5 years. I gave her the glasses she pulled them out to check them and do the return and said the glasses had a scratch but wouldn't show me where. She then proceeded to bag the sunglasses up, and tell me that they were eligible for a return. I am totally unsure how they have a scratch when I literally only opened them and boxed them straight back up. On top of thAt they have a sunglasses bag, case and a box. How do you even manage to get them scratched horrible service will not go back!",negative
"One of what must be 700 LV boutiques in Vegas, the Fashion Show Mall location is decent sized, carries a good range of most LV products. They've got a much bigger selection of women's accessories - as is the case with most LV boutiques - but options for men's are still plenty. Service wise, I've had fairly good luck here over the course of a few shopping trips, with one especially great experience with Danna Cruz. On the hunt for a few small gifts for friends and family, she took the time to listen to my needs, then suggested appropriate items, wrapped them up, and even called a couple of the other other local LV boutiques when they didn't have the style I wanted. Not all LVs deliver an excellent experience - and to be honest, very few do it consistently - but this one is at the top of my list.",positive
"When my mother in law comes into town we always have a good time and on this visit we spent the day shopping. Since we both own a few LV we can appreciate the brand but not the hike in prices that have skyrocketed over the years. We asked the saleslady a few questions about specific pieces we owned and what the value is now-and honestly they've almost doubled. My mother in law was regretting not buying the bag she wanted a few years back. I was grateful I bought my doggy bag and other pieces way back when too. She looked at a few bags and the saleslady was very patient. Nice place to browse and shop for that special gift if you're wallet is big enough! You can find shoes, luggage bags, sunglasses and accessories at this store. Located on the second floor across from Tiffany & Co another favorite high-end store.",positive
"Salespersons LACK customer service...very judgmental and snobbish. These workers believe they are somebody because of the nice suits they wear, when in fact they are just NOBODY (located at Fashion Show Mall)",negative
"I'm only giving this store two stars because the sales associate that WE had to approach was helpful and very patient. First off my girlfriend and I along with her two sisters walk into the empty store, not one out of the 4 associates, greeter/guard, and bald douche bag manager even bothered to acknowledge us. We then stood in the middle of the store for about 2 to 3 minutes trying to find the list of bags we wanted to purchase, everyone there continued to bullshit around (two sales associates were standing and talking not even 4 feet away from us). WE had to finally approach a lady behind a counter for help, god knows how long it would have taken if we waited for someone to approach us. After we finished paying we were waiting for our purchase to get boxed and bagged up, the bald douche bag felt the need to make rounds around us thinking we were going to steal something. If that was the manager seriously shame on him and that sorry excuse for customer service, I've seriously had better service at fast food joints. Then the cherry on top was after we were about to leave we briefly looked at a wallet case near the entrance and one of the two associates that were having the conversation earlier finally asked if we needed help after she notice the large box/bag we had. I don't normally bitch about customer service, but this store stereotyped the shit out of us. If you want a pleasant shopping experience I suggest you skip the fashion show location and go to the Wynn or Forum Shops. I've never had a problem with either of those locations. End Rant",negative
"WHERE: Located inside the Fashion Show Mall. WHEN: 10am-9pm, Monday through Saturday. 10am-8pm, Sunday. WHY: To get your Louis V fix on. WHAT: Firstly, I would like to state that this is one of the smaller Louis Vuitton stores in Las Vegas. There isn't a huge selection like there is inside the Wynn and the Forum shops, but it'll do. The advice I'd give is, if you know what you're looking for, call them in advance to check if the item you have is there. That's what I did, and when I showed up to pick it up, I was completely satisfied. As my mom and I walked inside the store, the doorman greeted us so kindly. One of the employees immediately asked us if we needed any help. I knew what I wanted, and he gladly helped me make my decision. He gave such wonderful choices and knew about each of the pieces I asked about. I love someone who knows their product! So, to end this in a good way... CUSTOMER SERVICE WAS GRADE A, FIVE STARS, AND A THUMBS UP!! =D",positive
"I thought maybe the LV in this mall would be a little more ""wow"", but it isn't. I'd have to give big props to the Wynn which has the coolest LV boutique in Vegas.",negative
"Lucky you! This location at miracle mile seems to be better stocked than the fashion mall location. The sale rack had by far much more selection. I found two tops that I had been eye spying online that I could try on in person and purchase just the right size. The sales people were helpful and gave their honest opinion on the exact, perfect fit for me. Happy with my purchases and feel like I scored!",positive
"I like the brand itself a lot, but a couple of the sales people were really off putting. One made some age crack trying to be funny (it wasn't), and the other who cashed me out was about as apathetic as possible. Definitely won't be back.",negative
"Great service, great clothes, reasonable prices. I'm a guy in my forties and my sales pro got me into a perfect set of jeans, upsold me a nice shirt but didn't overdo it. I will definitely be back.",positive
"I have never really shopped at Lucky Brand but after this Vegas experience, they have a loyal customer. The guy that worked their was so friendly and helpful. I would have bought ocean front property in Vegas from him. He made great suggestions, helped find several styles of jeans that would work and very knowledgeable about each style (including how they will stretch out). They had some great deals! $40 off of jeans (still expensive, but now a much better deal) and 40% off of clearance. I felt like everything in the store was stylish and high quality, but you already knew that! :)",positive
"I love the every time I've walked in to a Lucky store, they always guess the exact size and style of jeans that I'm wearing. This time I also bought a bunch of shirts. The staff offered advice and opinions and was very helpful through out.",positive
"My DH is the most impossible person to buy jeans for in the entire world! Whenever we find a pair that fits and he likes them, we buy at least 2 pairs. He has been in desperate need of jeans for a few months now, so when we saw the Lucky Store in the mall we decided to go in. The guy that helped us out was really nice and kept pulling different styles and sizes for him. We scored when he found a pair that he likes...and it was buy one get one 1/2 off!! You can't beat that!!",positive
"I will never buy another brand of jeans after finding Lucky about 2 yrs ago. Ive talked friends that would never dare spend that much on a pair of jeans into becoming true addicts like me. (some joke that i should be their spokes person) Their tshirts are a bit expensive for my taste, but as soon as you put them on you can see why. their the softest most puuuurfect fitting tshirts Ive found (even talked mom, the clearance rack queen into buying some). The most important thing that keeps me back is the service...I go to the fashion show A LOT. Lucky is the only store that always greats me with a 'honest' friendly hello.. a few of the guy remember me and have learned my taste so they're very quick to show me the new stuff that they just know ill love..and i will..cause I'm such a sucker in that store. ;)",positive
"Ok so I love Lucky Brand. If you've never put your ass in Lucky's then you would not know what I'm talking about. Lucky's just feel good. Like jeans that have already been broken in...but NEW. It's got that old rock and roll style with a little Ibiza Hippie in it. Everything is just SOFT! I got into l Lucky's years ago and from that point on I was hooked. 95% of my jeans are Lucky. All my cargos are Lucky. 80% t-shirts...LUCKY. I even have my own personal shopper at Lucky. Erin's the Manager at this Lucky and she's always been really good about helping me. Brad is my personal Lucky Shopper at Fashion Show mall. He usually informs me of sales, and special Lucky events. Yea so if there's something I splurge on....It's Lucky. This store is a little bigger than the one at Fashion Show. I kinda like the Desert Passage a little better. Plus there's this Lucky Buddha in the front of the store. This Lucky is more brightly lit than the one at Fashion Show. I'm starting to get sick of saying the word ""Lucky"" but it's ok. Because I love Lucky Brand. BTW There's a Lucky shirt that has Pignose Amps on it. You should buy it. Because it's my Uncle's company and if you don't know Pignose. Then you don't Rock!",positive
I adore this location. The staff are extremely helpful and super friendly. Same prices as everywhere else but the customer service is phenomenal. I will 100% return to this location.,positive
"Amazing Service! I absolutely love this location. All of the employees are super friendly and helpful. They are patient and will keep bringing you styles until you find something great! I was in the store for about an hour after they officially closed and the staff were really cool with it. I kept apologizing and they said, ""Don't worry! We're still here!"" I will definitely make this my go-to Lulu store. Note to head office: Please bring back the groove pants with a bootcut or a similar style pant. Those styles look the best on me. The skinny ones weren't too amazing on my curvy and petite frame but I bought it anyways... Thank you! One of your loyal customers. :)",positive
"I like the concept of Lululemon. They inspire you to go running, do yoga and look good doing them. I visit their website often to get motivation. I have been to their free yoga class once and I loved it. I have not regretted buying a thing from this store. I use my sweaters, shorts, sports bra and tank top that I purchased over the last 2 years regularly. They are still in good shape even after hundreds of washes. The staff is very helpful.",positive
"This Lululemon's location will always be special for me. I participated in their annual Parkinson Yoga thorn every year for the last 3 years. Make sure you get those raffle tickets! The price is just so awesome: Blue Jays tickets, Lulu's top, cook books..... and all for a good cause!! I led my first ever Community Class in this location. My first class in a store with mix level with over 30 yogis! That's memorable! The staffs always so kind and supportive and friendly. This lululemon is more than just another yoga clothing store for me!!",positive
"I go to this location quite often as it's very close to my regular yoga studio. The staff here is always very friendly, helpful & enthusiastic. I find the common sizes are gone fast here so you have to hurry & call if you want smth. They have no probs reserving an item for you as long as you're there by end of day. There's always a small markdown section everytime I go in.",positive
Disgusting service. I was in the store for almost 30 mins and not one person said anything to me. The associates were too busy talking about a trip to Miami ! You're an outlet store ... could you be any lower on the food chain?,negative
"I am so happy that I came across this place. And at the same time, so so sad that is in Arizona and not in Santa Barbara. They are organized by size which is genius. They have eliminated the time consumed by pawing through a million different racks of clothes to find a damn size eight. Three pairs of lulu's for what I would pay for two. Yasss. So much joy filled my heart. This place is a gem & I will be visiting again on my next trip to AZ.",positive
Nice shop with great customer service. You'll enjoy the lower prices of the outlet. They do have a limited selection compared to their Scottsdale location. Their employees call you by first name and give you all the attention you want.,positive
"The Lululemon outlet is always a must for me during any trip to Phoenix. In Los Angeles we don't have any Lulu outlets and most of the Lulu storefronts barely have a clearance rack, but this storefront is a dream. When you walk in, men's clothing is at the front to the right and women's clothing takes up all of the back and the right. You never know what to expect when you get here (I've had days that are both hit and miss), but that's the charm of this place. They usually have special deals that are bigger than others ($29 sweatpants, $39 jackets, etc.) as well as a store-wide deal (additional 15% off everything, extra 25% off all bottoms, etc.) which usually drive my focus. The staff in the dressing rooms is incredibly helpful in terms of giving you feedback if you're shopping alone or making sure you find that perfect outfit! Just one word of warning - there are no returns for purchases at this location so make sure you really want something when you get it!",positive
I always have to stop by this store when I come in town. They change the deals everyday that is posted on the board right when you walk in. The employees that work here are always sooooooo sooooo nice. They are helpful and sweet. I wish most places would get this kind of customer service to make every shopping experience great. I have referred many friends to try this location out not only for the deals but for the experience you get when you come here. If I lived close by I would be here every week. Fortunately for my bank account I live a few hours away,positive
The prices aren't super discounted compared to surrounding stores but you can still get some good deals! They had super cute clothes unfortunately very few options for sizes 2-6 which I believe are the most common :/ and you can't just order them online in your size and get the same price. I did pick out 3 pairs of leggings and 2 sports bras and it came out to a little under $300 but still around $100 cheaper than retail!!!,positive
"This store is well worth the drive from Gilbert. While I love Lulu, I haven't always been met with the same friendliness at all nearby locations. This one, however, is delightful. The prices are very reasonable and I look forward to many more day trips to Glendale.",positive
"When I saw that they had an outlet store for Lululemon, I was so happy! I've heard so many wonderful things about this brand but when I saw the prices (online), it made me cry. My friends that have the clothing say it's totally worth it. So I wanted to get it out for myself. But with this being an outlet, the prices are lower than what I saw online. When I walked in, I was greeted with a price list. So the prices on the tags were higher than what they had on this list. So I seriously felt like this was a great deal! The store is organized by size and it seemed a little chaotic with all the people. The store is small so you definitely bump into people while looking for a size. I was able to find exactly what I was looking for, but there really wasn't too much of a variety. I could've easily spent more money at this store, but held back being this is my very first Lululemon purchase. I wanted to see if it what I had purchased, lived up the representation. It has so far. The employees were very friendly. I recommend stopping at this store if you're in the area... or not in the area!",positive
Nice store and friendly staff. I wish there were more items in my size though. It is nice to have another option instead of having to check the retail stores sale rack daily. I love their clothes to workout it in because they don't feel sweaty and they don't ride up or get stuck like other brands.,positive
"This review is for the customer service. I was visiting from out of state and noticed they had a sale. Even though the store was crowded, everything was organized and I was asked by every employee if I needed help. Once back at my hotel that night I realized my diamond pendant necklace was missing from my neck. I was panicking because I had visited a gazillion places that day across the state and had no idea where I had lost it. I called this store and yes an amazing employee had found it on the fitting room floor and they had it. So thankful for their honesty and professionalism. Will definitely be back here on my next visit to Phoenix!",positive
"I stopped here on the way home from the zoo hoping for some bargains but truth be told, you'll do better price wise on the clearance racks at a regular retail Lululemon store or on line in the ""We Made Too Much"" section. For example, they had a white pacesetter running skirt for $49. I bought mine on clearance at the Chandler mall for $39 and it's currently on sale on line for $34. They did have a large quantity of sales items, the whole store is sales items and the store is divided into sizes so that's handy but prices were more than I expected.",negative
"I have come here about ten times now since I first discovered it, and I have yet to be disappointed. I got all of my Christmas gifts for friends here and I don't think I have been to the actual Lulu store since I found this place.",positive
"I came here the first part of August and found some great bottoms and tops. Store was very busy, tons of help and best of all they did a flash sale, 3 bottoms for $100!! Today I came and it was horrible from beginning to end. To start, there was a football game but other than traffic I really didn't think parking would be an issue. They tried to charge me $10 to park which I flat out refused to pay, even after I was told it could go towards my purchase. I parked for free. Upon entering the store I was greeted and told where the sale items were. I went to the racks where the pants were. Not only were they very ugly (outlet store) they were all priced at $89 or more. Seriously not much less than going to the normal stores and getting great merchandise. The help wasn't any better. In the back they were dancing and all the others were having private conversations. Oh and did I mention that I was the only one in the store. It was pretty pitiful. I'm not real sure if I'll ever be back.",negative
"A few weeks ago I Googled ""Lululemon Outlets"" on a whim to see where the few chosen locations in the country were. I figured my best bet to catch one would be on a future road trip out to California or something. Imagine my immediate HEART ATTACK when I saw Lululemon Westgate ""opening soon""...WHAT! You better believe I hauled my cookies way out yonder to check out the location. There's not many things that prompt me to drive 40 minutes to Glendale, but yes, the Lulu outlet is definitely one of them. I love that it's organized by size. Makes hunting down your styles super easy. I've read a few people on their Facebook complaining about the selection of shorts, but I thought they easily made up for it in the pants section, at least in the 6 and 8 sections I fall into. Employees were super friendly as usual. If anything, I'd say the store went a little overboard in stocking outerwear, but I'm sure they can't pick and choose what they receive from HQ's ""We Made Too Much."" Not necessarily a huge need in the Valley, but I can see how this would be an insane find for people visiting from colder climates. I walked out with a pair of full-length Wunder Unders and two tanks for about $60 less than I've paid for at a regular Lulu. Absolutely worth the trek! Yay!",positive
This is one of the better locations in the area. I love that they offer high end designer clothing for discounted prices. Not all Marshalls' have super high end designer clothing offered. Today I bought a Derek Lam dress for $150. They had Herve Lever for $400. They have a lot of the smaller design houses too - I'm impressed. What's not so impressive is their home goods section. It's lacking. Stick to the clothes and the beauty section - they are generally pretty good at this store. I'll continue to shop this location!,positive
"This isn't my closest Marshalls but it will definitely do! I shopped around. Looked at shoes, houseware and a few knick knacks. Overall, the store was pretty organized. I did get a pair of kate spade sandals for $18 what what!! I got a few pillows and some things that I probably didn't need to spend money on. I didn't wait long to check out and the clerk was pretty friendly. Overall, the experience was good!",positive
"I love this location. There are lots of homegoods options and a large selection of clothing. Their intimates section appears to be double the size of most stores. The checkout line was full when I visited but they moved people through quickly and when the line was long, other staff came up front to open more registers. Everyone I interacted with was friendly and helpful.",positive
"It's hard not to leave without a careful of stuff, but it's definitely worth it. Shoes, clothes, furniture, pet stuff, food, gifts, it's amazing! This is one of my favorite stores because it's easy to see everything and not as cluttered as other Marshalls. While I love their English mugs (hard to find) and clothes, my favorite find is the Carlsbad Oblaten cookies. I know what you're thinking, just cookies? what? NO YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND, these are my favorite cookies on earth and I cannot find them ANYWHERE else. They are very expensive on QVC if you're lucky enough to catch them, but they're only $7.99 at Marshalls. I check back constantly to snatch as many as I can find, but recently it's been very hard to find a box of them. I hope they order more for the holidays because I just don't know where else to get my precious cookies!",positive
Clean and organized. A great treat to visit when I am on this side of town. I appreciate the friendliness of the staff especially the older lady that works in the dressing room.,positive
Love that I can find a good selection and some great name brands. I like to stop in just to see what they have from time to time,positive
"What's in Store for Men Today As of this morning, Boss, Brooks Brothers, Brunello Cucinelli, Corneliani, Diesel, Eton, Gucci, Marmot, Ralph Lauren (green, purple, and black labels), John Varvatos, Just Cavali, Theory, Versace, Vince, and Z Zegna were interspersed between dozens of lesser known labels and lots of 'Christmas' sweaters. However, in comparison to other Marshalls, the men's selection here is better, which makes shopping this location most interesting. While there are many racks containing a 1/2 dozen of the same sweater, Polo shirt, or tie, occasionally, you'll find that unique and well made item separating itself from the fashion drones. Prices for ""designer"" or better maker items can range from $60 to $600 for an Italian made cashmere pullover. Better maker winter coats have a range but seem to top off at $1300. In general, Marshalls has a tendency to dress men casually from the waste up. This one is no exception. You won't find men's shoes, or quality men's trousers. However, Van Husen, Hagaar, Dockers and the like are plentiful if you desire nothing fancier. For better, a trip to your favorite department store, or clothier will serve you better. Before you go dashing to the men's section, to have a look at all of the above mentioned labels, you should be aware of its limitations. 1) If you're the type of man who likes a 10 min or less shopping experience because by Job, you're a man, and stabbing a thing, tossing it over your shoulder and taking it home is what you are born to do, this location is not for you. It's cramped in a claustrophobic way. The racks and tables are disheveled. It's poorly organized. The lighting is bad, and you're going to have to turn your inner hunter into a gatherer...leaving no t-shirt unturned. 2)That purple Versace zip up could only be pulled off by a couple of guys with Caribbean heritage, Liberace, or Sir Elton John. There are dozens more designer items falling into that category. It appears Marshalls buys overstock, but they also buy menswear for that special invitation to Pee-Wee's Big Adventure, or your own. Overall, I'd recommend it for spare time browsing rather than for when you have a specific article in mind.",positive
"I came to Charlotte for a business trip and being the avid TJ, Marshalls, and Home Goods shopper that I am I had to see what the Charlotte location had to offer. Seriously, I have been to stores all acorss the country and this is hands down the best one I have ever been too!!! Three racks of designer jeans Joes, Citizens, Rag & Bone, Paige just to name a few all priced $59-$79. Found a Clover Canyon jacket that I didn't buy and now deeply regretting it can't find it anywhere online cheaper or in stock! Crying!!! I want to go back and I bet it is not there now anyway. High end pieces their still pricey but are deeply discounted. Big home area as well, the whole store was fully stocked and everything was neatly organized. Supposed to be back in Charlotte in 2 weeks you can bet I will be back!",positive
"Before you judge me on my two stars, hear me out!!! The store was semi-disorganized and it made me feel chlosterphobic. I was there in search of sandals at a decent price. And when I say decent I mean under or right at $20 bucks. The shoes were displayed neatly but the boxes underneath them?? All over the place. some of the shoes were put back in the wrong spot. Frustrating. I hate having to hunt for red october and locate items in random places. Needless to say I was over hunting for shoes under $20. I moved on to slippers. Found some for under $10. Score! That makes up for the shoe fiasco. Moved on to jean shorts and was immediately turned off by the disorganized clothing racks. I took my $7 slippers to the counter and checked out. I was over it by this time. Maybe I should give myself 1 star and not the store. I just hate going in here because it's never really organzied and I find myself wanting to clean up instead of shopping. I have issues.",negative
"I love Marshalls but this location was just to cramp! I guess Marshalls has to have a quota of items in every store or something but this location was had no elbow room. I also didn't find as many things as usual at this location. Even though I love these stores and this one is located next to a lot of other great shops, I won't be back just because I got sick of saying excuse me fifty times while squeezing through the spaces between display racks.",negative
"One of my top two favorite Marshall's in Charlotte. - carries higher end line if clothing - has more selections to choose from - conveniently located with or neat shops in the area like Bath/Body, Ulta, Books-a-Million, Harris Teeter, etc...",positive
"INSANE amount of shoes, and good size selection as well! As far as marshall's go, if I'm looking for anything other than clothing, I choose this one. Yes, they do have a small contemporary selection and some decent higher end denim options, a little bcbg, a little michael kors... but it seems like everyone knows this already, and for me everything after that little bubble was just boring. But, the shoes? holy crap. Their boot selection rivals a shoe warehouse's and they have a ton of shoes on clearance. The home goods, awesome. A surprisingly large collection of cook books, have even found a fiction book I was planning on buying as a gift off amazon. I was actually surprised how many gourmet food items they have, and the selection of really nice kitchen wares (even most of the line from the Palm Restaurant). If you need a green olive stuffed with anything other than a pimento - you can find it at this Marshall's! Tons of kids toys, children's clothing, and a good selection of electronics accessories (ear buds, head phones, etc) as you check out. Not much help as far as while you're shopping, but the cashiers are usually super friendly. It's clean, its nicely set up, and if you didn't prepare yourself to spend an hour sifting through the racks, there is a well kept bathroom in the back left corner.",positive
"This is a great Marshall's -- with everything from super ladies shoes to soaps to housewares and great clothes, this store has an awesome selection of everything! When the holidays roll around, this is a great place to search for great gifts for everyone on your list.",positive
"Let me say that I consider myself somewhat of a Marshalls/TJ Maxx connoisseur. If I spend more than two hours in a store my roommate has the uncanny ability to know that I must be shopping at Marshall's. This is the BEST location I have found, period. The clothes are a bit higher end as Nicole mentioned, but all in great condition and really you can find something cute with minimum digging. My last trip I ended up with an Italian-made sweater dress for fifty dollars, and a Cynthia Rowley shawl for thirty! It is also a great place to stock up on inexpensive basics - two pairs of Betsy Johnson tights for $10, $4 camisoles, $16 knit scarves, yes please! TONS of shoes for you collectors out there too! One of my favorite things about this store is that they carry a huge selection of higher-end beauty products. Joico, Wella, Body Shop, Wildaid, Nexus, clinique etc.. They also have fantastic deals on specialty food items, pots and pans (discounted Calphalon), and other home-wares. Plus easy parking, Ulta and Petsmart right next-door!",positive
I have never been a fan of Marshall's or TJ Maxx until this one changed my mind. Amazing merchandise. Even carries niche fashion brands that are hard to find in the QC even at Southpark. Big fan.,positive
"I love to shop, but even I can get a bit overwhelmed with the discount retailers and their racks and racks of unorganized clothing. But I do love a deal, so I always try a discount retailer at least once before crossing them off the list. I happen to live in the Cotswold area and love this Marshall's. It's clean, has a crazy ton of great shoes (my weakness), and is pretty well organized in terms of these type of stores. The clothing selection is always well stocked, and this is my first stop if I'm looking for great workout clothes on the cheap. I've purchased Nike, Adidas, Under Armour and Puma gear here. I've noticed (but have yet to purchase), multiple top name designer clothing items as well. I've also picked up a great yoga mat, gifts for my friends kids and my nephew (great selection of hard cover books for much cheaper than retail prices), packets of cards for the notes I like to send, and even a duvet set and sheets for our spare bedroom. The kitchen section has a great selection of pots and pans, as well as other miscellaneous kitchen items that you didn't even know existed (which, of course, you immediately MUST have). There are always a ton of cashiers on hand, so even if the line looks long, it'll be a short wait. Ultimately, for a last minute gift or just to peruse what's available, this Marshall's is a great bet if you're on a budget.",positive
"In the world of copious ""dress for less"" stores, i.e. Ross, Marshall's TJ Maxx, etc. this particular store and location is one of my faves. Why oh why is this Marshall's so spectacular? Well, let me count the ways: -Tons and tons of designer jeans. I'm a total jean fanatic so this can present a problem and a solution if you know what I mean. I've seen Rock and Republic, Joe's, Sevens, Citizens, etc. They aren't super, super cheap but at least 50% off their original (insane) prices. -The most amazing shoe offerings I've ever seen at a Marshall's. It's a vast collection and I've seen some swank-ay designers within here - I'm talking Prada and D&G. For realz. -A pretty decent selection of workout gear and clothing. Tons 'o Under Armour and some Nike. There are also plenty of clothes and shoes for the dudes and the kiddos, just make sure you schedule enough time to look around! Happy shopping, to all!",positive
"I love this Marshalls!! Clean, organized and a great selection of stuff... I go into Marshall's or Tj Maxx to just look for different or unique things and usually always find it.",positive
"Selection in all sections of the store were sparse. I found a pair of shoes I liked but as I looked closer the heel wedges had dirt the shoe beds had dirt on them and a major metal embellishment was partially broken off the top part of the shoe which was glaring noticeable. They had been marked down in price but with all the mars the price was too high in my opinion. The shoes were cute so I put them in my cart. There weren't many items I was attracted to. After about an hour I did find a cute dress on sale for $9.99 - score! I took my items to check out. I reviewed the shoes with all it's issues with the cashier which to me were most likely unsellable and asked if they would reduce the price at all. The sales associate looked over the shoes and said she'd take off 10%. In my opinion that was beyond a ridiculous offer. I declined and did not buy the shoes. The place was clean. The sales associate I spoke with, asked questions and checked out with was very nice and polite. I don't know if I would go back there with the less than desirable selection. I understand one has to spend time and look through many items to possibly find something in these type of discount stores. I don't know if I want to take the time here. I prefer Ross. Unfortunately they don't have them around here. One last note. There was a teenage girl with her mom trying on shoes while I was looking at shoes. While mom was looking in another aisle I asked her what she thought about a pair of sneakers I was trying on she nodded yes and said her best friend had a pair. She took off the pair of heels she had on as her mom went to another aisle as I was taking off the sneakers I looked over and she had tried on another pair of heels, black bootie type with peep toe and tassle, so cute and looked great on her. I told her how cute they were and those were the ones! She went to show her mom and said she loved them but would have to change her whole outfit. Ah the things we do for the cute, perfect have to have shoes",negative
Will never return to this location wow really what a complete Joke and of course no Privacy. The Bathrooms stalls had no doors in the Men's bathroom. Its real sad i hope it was not this way in the ladies bathroom. But something needs to be done. i am shocked management would not close the stall down or something. What is a Handicap wheel chair person suppose to if he needs to go to the bathroom... I spendt 15 minutes walking around trying to find a manager or employee about this matter and not one employee was around that can help me. Do not return to this store....,negative
This place is a little gem. I took my grand daughter shopping for school clothes. She is 16 and was able to find a lot of styles she loved. I shopped as well but found they did not have as large a selection in my bigger size. Prices were really reasonable and there was a lot to look at. I had only stopped there once before briefly but will definitely go back.,positive
"I like Marshalls because they sometimes have very good branded stuff for very low prices. This particular store is nice but not as organized as others I have been to in the past. I like their location and proximity to some of the grocery places I frequently visit. I could not find what I was looking for here and that might be just co incidence. Now that I am thinking about it, I have never found anything interesting at this store during my many past visits. There has to be something good about this place that attracts me here every now and then.",negative
"So, my dogs ate my sandles this morning anx I needed to wear my boots. I did look pretty silly in shorts and a pair of boots. So, I walked in and went straight for the sandles. Found so many pairs that I wanted and ultimately settled on a pair of yoga slings. I'm obsessed with this brand. So much cheaper at Marshals. I got two pairs. The store was packed but, very clean and the check out lines moved very quickly. I'll definitely go back.",positive
"Other than the fact that this Marshalls is a little on the smaller side, the store is very nice and in typical fashion, aplomb with great discounts . Love the clearance section and the fact that it is lever super crowded- like some of the other stores in the area.",positive
My favorite place for clothes and goodies. Best brands and best prices. They actually have an awesome beauty section with a lot of cool and unique items. Tip: get the TJX card for coupons every time you shop.,positive
"Love Marshalls!!!!! Such affordable clothing and you can find everythig from Abercrombe to Polo, shoot I even found Armani that got snapped up faster than the speed of light!!! If you are a bit of a cothes horse such as mself Marshalls/TJ Maxx is the place!!!!!!",positive
"Am I turning into a girl or what? I like to think my masculinity is intact, but after the following admission, I may have to re-evaluate: there are definitely worse ways than spending your lunch hour bumming around Marshall's. The whole vibe of the place is an upscale Big Lots, but thankfully without the sketchy food items. There are pretty cool deals on clothing, but if you're a dude like me, you'll mainly check out the sales on electronic crap and (even though I'm 31) the toy section. They also have a great selection of random tchotchkes, so if you want a set of Doberman-shaped salt-and-pepper shakers, you know where to go.",positive
Quick and done right. She took an inch off of the hem of my jeans and you can't tell they've been altered (which is what I wanted). The price was reasonable and they were done on the date promised. Hours of operation are convenient.,positive
"Daughter took wedding gown to be cleaned and preserved. When we picked it up, it was just folded up and put in a box. So disappointed.",negative
"My daughters alterations were perfect! Prom dress fits like glove! So happy. I finally have found alterations business who take pride in their work, attention to detail is phenomenal. We will be back.",positive
"If I could, I'd give this place a 10-star rating! I've had a number of things altered here! They have also altered (let out) a suit for my husband, & changed the hem on a formal for my daughter in college. The price is ALWAYS very reasonable & I have NEVER had to ask for speedy delivery; the work is always completed in such a short amount of time. The prices here are so good, that I have even brought shorts & jeans up to be hemmed! She can do ANYTHING! I needed my full length, lined London Fog coat to be shortened due to moth damage. When I got my coat back, one would have NEVER KNOWN it had been altered. This was a huge savings, as it kept me from having to buy a new coat! BRAVO!!!",positive
"I have used Matthews Alterations for several years now. I am always very pleased with the service. I have been sewing of over 40 years and could do my own alterations, but don't really have the time. The cost of getting them done here is very reasonable. My alterations are always done perfectly. The owner is an expert in what she does. She has suggested additional alterations to a few of my garments that have made them look custom made. She completes the work in just a few days. I highly recommend this alteration shop.",positive
"Laura is great with alterations! I have gotten jeans hemmed, a dress with boning taken in, and a silk tweed suit hemmed and taken in. Everything she's ever taken in for me has fit perfectly. I'm getting married in a few weeks, and after getting frustrated with the limited availability, projected number of fittings, and projected cost at the bridal salon where I bought my dress, decided to go to Laura. I live out of town, and she was very considerate of my limited availability. I think I called on a Friday, and she told me to come in any time the next day. She pinned my dress up in about ten minutes, and told me to come back in two weeks. My dress is trumpet with lace overlay. She took in the sides, cut down the train, hemmed the bottom, and added a bustle--for HALF what it as supposed to cost at the bridal salon. Also, she did a great job. The hemming involved removing lace overlay, cutting down the length of the dress, replacing the lace overlay, and hemming all the underlayers. For the bustles, she put in several ties and paid attention to making sure it worked with the flow of the dress. She also made sure the bustles fell so that they would not show the underlayers of the dress. People talk about going in for multiple fittings, but with Laura it was one and done. It took a lot of stress off of me to not have to worry about it, and I felt a lot of pride at not getting suckered by the bridal shop with its high cost, three fittings, and appointments that have to be made weeks in advance. I would highly recommend Laura to any bride!",positive
"We had the worst experience with this place! My husband's alterations were dropped off and paid on July 2013, additional alternations were needed, and therefore he left his suits to be picked up on a later date. First Trip: My husband works abroad, therefore I went to pick up the alterations on August 2013, with a receipt marked PAID. The lady (owner) stated the alternations were not paid and refused to relinquish my husband suits, even with the receipt marked PAID. Her theory: if the other two carbon receipts were not marked PAID, the transaction did not occur. Second Trip: My husband was very adamant about the fact that he paid and he reassured me. I went back to the shop and asked if she could research her records plus the receipt was marked PAID. She refused to relinquish the suits; she was very rude and basically ignored me. Third Trip: Now, I am second-guessing my husband, because this is asinine. However my husband has a great memory and he deals with numbers all day therefore I attempted to visit the shop again. She still refused to relinquish the suits. I asked again if she could ""please"" check her financial records, check the register...anything... I just want to pick up my husband suits. Still no suits...my husband spent some time checking our bank statements and there was a payment of $114.00 made on July 5, 2013 with a reference number from Matthews Alterations. My husband immediately called the owner, she told him, the police had his suits. I called the lady and stated we had proof we paid and I can swing by and bring our statement...she immediately cut me off and said she was going to call the police and that his suits were at the police station. She also mentioned we didn't want to pay for the suits we just wanted a free service. After the phone call, I had a police officer call me and asked if I could meet him at the shop. I arrive at the shop and there were two squad cars. I showed the police proof of payment as well as well as the owner. She then tried to say my bank statement wasn't real, wanted to copy my bank statement (which is illegal) and just because the word ""PAID"" was not written on her calendar marked July 5th the payment was not real. The police officer had to reassure her the bank statement was legit. Long story longer...the look of total humiliation on her face was indeed priceless. At each attempt, my husband and I were never disrespectful, and kept every visit professional. She was very rude, unprofessional, voided my existence, and lied about the suits being at the police station. Her bookkeeping is antiquated and suspicious and the shop is filthy! This could have been resolved in a timely manner, saving me gas, my time, and wasted tax dollars for calling Matthews Police department if she just would have provided me with Customer Service 101 by researching her financials. She needs to be audited by the IRS!",negative
"Why does this place not have enough reviews?? I just have to rave a little bit about the service and great work this place does for alterations. I went on a whim on Blanka's review below... bought a super expensive wedding gown, so I was a little hesitant taking it to a local (non-bridal) place for alterations for my wedding gown. Laura couldn't have done any better...I had her do a bustle, bust adjustment, hemming, and she did a GREAT job at a very reasonable price. It probably would have cost me a lot more if I took it to a bridal boutique for alterations. Don't hesitate to try Matthews Alterations & Cleaners :-) :-)",positive
"I would like to first make note of my FIVE star rating. I am not easily pleased as I truly believe and feel that businesses have to do what they are there to do which is PLEASE the CUSTOMER (as long as the customer is not an IGNORANT individual trying to give them a HARD TIME, I commend those who are still good with these people as well. NOW TO THE REVIEW: I was the Matron of Honor in a friend's wedding on March 9, 2013 in Dallas, TX and my husband and I are new to Charlotte, NC so we have to start all over to find a cleaners, tailor, doctors, etc.. (you get the point). My dress was ""custom"" from a boutique in Dallas, TX where they made the dress according to your measurements which mine are very UNNORMAL 36-26-42. The dress was $275 with shipping and when it arrived it smothered me (they sent a size 16 and I have NEVER worn a 16 in my LIFE). I went to SEVEN - YES SEVEN tailors in and around Charlotte and was told that the dress had to be taken apart and put back together in order to fit me because they needed to take about 16 inches from the dress from different areas in order for the dress to fit my Original Coca Cola bottle figure and the cost would range from $225-$300 which would put this HORRIBLE dress in the price range of $500 - $600. My LAST and FINAL stop was to Matthews Alterations & Cleaners (my husband suggested we try them because we see the place every time we go to Costco). I didn't express to them the price I had been given at the SEVEN other alteration shops I just tried it on and spoke on the HORROR the dress is causing. Laura Tran was so Funny, NICE and understanding. She laughed with me when I put the dress on and it fell to the floor when I stop holding it up. She put pins everywhere and told me to come back next week which I did and tried it on again, it had to be worked on again and I came back the third time and you would have NEVER thought it was the SAME DRESS it was ABSOLUTELY PERFECT and after all that work I didn't care how much it cost and OVERALL it only cost me $60 I could not BELIEVE it. I gave her a $40 tip because I just couldn't believe that she took my dress apart and put it back together so PERFECTLY and HUMBLY and was so NICE to me and my FAMILY in the process. This is my family NEW Alteration shop DEFINITELY!!!!",positive

"I am writing this review based on customer service. Maria Zaldana helped me in the process of selecting a beautiful ring. I must say, she exhibited top customer service and professionalism. I believe in my heart she was honest and gave me a fair deal on my ring........MTF Maria and the ring are a winner ! Thanks Maria !!",positive
"I went in today to get rid of a few things I had in the back of my closet. Upon entering I was greeted by all the staff there. Steve was the rep that help me with my transaction. He was very personable, knowledgeable and professional. He walked me through all the steps, and advised me how much I would be getting. If you want to be treated fairly make your way down there. If I have anything else I want to get rid of, I will bring it to Steve.",positive
"I purchased a coach purse here after hearing great things about max pawn, hearing them on the radio and a lot of other things. They did give me the yelp discount. I went to LA and the coach store the next week. At that store I was informed the purse was a fake. This surprised me greatly, I really liked the purse. So I had to drive the 45 minutes from my home in Henderson to come up there. Yes they did refund my money, but not my time nor an apology from them. I was shocked and upset, they basically said it is a so what someone got one over on them.",negative
"Do not trust anything that they say, any advertisements that they put out. They lie and they will not honor their word! Watch out for this place. They act nice and then they lie to you!",negative
Max Pawn is very unique pawnshop it's nothing like your normal average pawnshop they go over and beyond to find you anything you can imagine.Dawn at Max Pawn will literally find you anything you can want from the Watch you have always wanted but didn't think you could afford to the Purse your wife always wanted .They have a great layaway program . And if your ever short on cash they will give you a loan on almost anything .Michal will always greet you with a smile as all of his staff will.,positive
I have been too a few shops in the valley.This shop by far offers the best amount for items you are trying to sell. Very good customer service overall great experience.,positive
"Friendliest staff ever. Variety of merchandise is amazing. Got a small loan and they waived the interest for the first 30 days. Far from where I live, but I'll definitely be back.",positive
"Wanted to sell a few items without hassling with eBay so I decided to give this place a chance. Walked in and had my items appraised by an older, odd looking guy. I brought in a Certina Italian divers watch and this he began ""appraising"" it. First, this person had no idea what he was doing, he said the watch is not working because the seconds hand would skip(as anyone who knows anything about fine watches knows, this is just a sign that the battery is low) but this guy had no clue and just said the watch is ""broken"". Next item, a Longines Dolce Vita Men's watch, which sells on eBay for 600-800 dollars(pre owned). He looks at it and offers me 80 dollars. That's when I knew this place was a waste of time. This ""appraiser"" not only looked slow but also was clueless and slimey. This is not a legitimate, honest business. SEEDY AND DISHONEST is all I have to say.",negative
I was just their today. James and Maria are excellent . They help me with My rMerchandise. I bought Micheal kors Purse and 2Mk watch. .love it and I will be back . I look them up on line and check them out . .Love the place.. they gave the best offer. Highly recommended . I'm happy . I'll buy more and will ck on -line since they are really so nice and Excellent Merchandise .Must go. Thanks again Liliag,positive
"HeyMichael Mack, Its business, i just wan ti be fair, with this happened, i feel i i lost about $200, if you give me refund, you dont have to be sorry,",negative
"I just moved here from California and wanted to get rid of some items. Steve helped me out without any issues. I had my grandfathers handgun that had been sitting in a box for I don't know how long. Understandably, the firearm was too damaged for them to buy and resell. But, there was another man there who was interested in taking it off my hands to restore it for his own personal enjoyment, and that made me feel good. Although I don't know anything about guns, Since it was my grandfathers it was kind of sentimental to me. I don't like to keep things laying around, especially a gun that I will never use.. So I'm happy that it went to someone who can get something out of it. Thank you Steve and Max pawn for making the experience good! I wil def be back!",positive
I came to get a price for my LV wallet but they pass on it because they said something about the serial number too small they mentioned that if I have the receipt for it they could probably match the numbers and since I know the receipt of that wallet and another purse are actually in pawn with them I ask them to go and get it for me but I guess they just don't feel like Goin back and get it I don't know if is because is Saturday and they just don't want to give that Xtra help.they said that i needed it to pick up the purse in order to get location of it... what a bssh***. thank you to the redhead and curly Spanic girl managers on duty that day. ( oh by the way the black lady that was helping me question why I don't take the wallet to the pawnshop I work?) Like really!! Maybe because sometimes I'm lucky and find good help with maxpawn!!,negative
"I have never had such a wonderful experience buying purse for my wife. Ydo was a tremendous help and is much appreciated. Ydo, you are reason enough to visit the store again. Thanks a bunch!",positive
I love this place Tanya and phill are the best they always get me the best deals and always let me know when they have the best shoes as well!,positive
Went into Max Pawn looking for a few things and was greeted right away by Jay who was very helpful and friendly. I'll definitely shop here again!,positive
"Very trusted seller. I just purchased a LV bag on Tradsey website, and i'm happy with my purchased. Well describe and easy to communicate with. Will do business with Max Pawn again. Highly recommended!!!!!",positive
"I looooooooove this place! Simply the best shopping in all of Las Vegas!! I have never received customer service like this before. The quality is top notch! I buy designer bags from all over the world, once I discovered this place/ It all stopped. Carmen, James, Steve and Michael (The whole staff) is the most caring and considerate to your buying needs.",positive
"This was one of the most wonderful shopping experiences I had! The first thing I noticed what the top quality products displayed all throughout the shop. There were a variety of designer brands and valuable merchandise visible in display cases and all over the walls, from Chanel and Louis Vuitton bags to autographed photos of John Lennon and Elvis Presley to Playstation and Nintendo Wii. I wasn't quite sure what I wanted to get when I initially came in but so many things caught my attention right away. I'm not one who likes to spend a long time shopping but I could've stayed till closing. The amount of care put into Max Pawn is apparent and the customer service matches the care put into the store and the many customers it attracts. All the store associates had positive attitudes and were eager to help. Ivan answered any questions I had, handled my purchases (a certified, framed genuine animated cel of the Disney movie Dumbo from the early 1940s and Rayban glasses with a case), and wrapped them safe and securely for my car ride back home to L.A. Michael Mack was front and center and greeted his customers personally; he takes pride in his shop and strives to make all his customers happy. The whole staff reflects this attitude as well which leaves a collective positive vibe. And of course, the deals were unbelievable! Good luck trying to find better deals on designer brands than Max Pawn. Everything is certified to be authentic and is top quality. Literally everybody was happy with what they were purchasing to the point where people were screaming with joy. One woman actually danced out of the store! I'm very pleased with my purchases (I couldn't help myself, I had to purchase more than one thing!) and would definitely come back! See you guys next time when I go to Vegas again!",positive
"Great experience with Max Pawn. I went in to sell some jewelry. They had a machine that figures out the metal content, and they weigh and quote a price right in front of you. Very efficient and upfront. I also found the staff friendly, and felt no pressure to sell. The price was right, however, so I did sell and would come to them again. Thanks to Jerry, who was wonderful!",positive
"Phillip is wonderful. Very professional and helpful. I brought in a lot of unwanted items and he gave me fair price for each one. I even brought in a 10 year old ""vintage"" gucci purse that belongs in the garbage but Phillip still took the time to appraise it and was very polite in the decline. The owner is a great help too. You can text him pictures of items and he gets back to you asap on ballpark price. No run around, no low balling, and beautiful items for sale. I won't ever pay full price for Chanel or Louis Vuitton again, they have a huge inventory of luxury items in perfect condition. Thanks for the help Phillip, pleasure doing business with you.",positive
"I tried selling a couple of my Louis Vuitton pieces here and have gotten low balled each time. To the point of walking out offended. I understand that they need to make a profit but offering me pennies for a purse that cost thousands; in which, they are also selling for thousands, is ridiculous. If you're looking to sell a designer purse, I believe you're better off selling it to an online consignment shop. Save your gas and your time.",negative
If you were looking for LV Chanel or Gucci come stop by and check it out. This place very clean and staff was very nice and helpful. i sell my LV wallet here. Maria gave me a great prices. Im definitely be back again not for sell but for shopping LOL. If you wanna buy any luxury purses or handbag (LV Chanel Gucci or even Hermes) this place is good before you go buy full price in the strip. It not brand new but it good deal no fake and clean,positive
Max pawn is great!!!..i love their collection of purses and great prices!!!...Laura Perez was very helpful and knowledgable!!!...will definitely shop here again!!,positive
Came in here this afternoon to sell a Nixon 51-30 watch and beats headphones. Got a very fair price and our transaction was handled quickly and professionally by Ray. I would recommend this place to anyone I know. Also had a great selection of luxury items. The shop is brand new and very clean. Great experience all around.,positive
I have been here a few times and I love their jewelry and high end accessories collection. They're very classy and know how to pick what they can sell. They really work with you when it comes to their layaway and pricing. All of the employees have real great personalities. Have I mentioned they have layaways on Hermes birkins???,positive
This place is great! Steve gave us excellent service.. I didn't know this little gem existed with all the high end good quality bags etc. Thanks guys!,positive
"I have just purchased several great handbags from Max Pawn. The gentleman handling my transaction was Steve. This man understands great personal customer service. Every part of my transaction was smooth, and easy. Since I live in Los Angeles, I was extra surprised at how attentive Steve was to my sale. My handbags were at my door within days, wrapped with care. The purses are great! It was extra nice to speak to a nice person who knew his product. Thanks MAX PAWN!",positive
"My husband is a long time client of Mephisto shoes but this store displayed the type of service that discourages a customer from buying shoes. When trying to compare styles, the very rude sales associate asked my husband not to remove shoes from the shelf because it was easier for her to keep track of the shoes. Also, when my husband tried on a pair, he was accused of creasing the shoe. My husband is very patient and literally had to advocate for himself to get a pair of shoes with very little help from this particular salesperson. I had to leave the store because she disgusted me. Worst service I've ever encountered.",negative
"I agree with Angela N, this store lacks decent customer service. The couple (male and female) seem to only like serving caucasian customer, if you are not one of them, forget about getting any service, I browsed patiently while they serve caucasian customers but even after they finished with them, the couple did not bother asking me whether I needed help. They could see that I was in the store trying shoes on, In the end I had to go up to the female sales person but just like the treatment Angela received, I also got the same treatment, This is so uncalled for, have they not heard of customer service ? I noticed that they are exceptionally nice to anyone who is caucasian and especially men. They obviously don't want business from other customers even though non-caucasian customers have money to pay too.",negative
This is a fantastic store! I'm on my feet all day and travelling a lot for work so a friend of mine in Montreal reccomended I try Mephisto's. I bought their version of the boat shoe and I wear it to death! It's amazing for travel and the leather molded to my foot so it's a perfect fit. The customer service is also really good in this store. They know exactly what they are talking about and they even told me how to wear the shoe in. It also came with a warantee which I haven't had to use yet but its good to know that its available!,positive
"I love Mephisto brand a lot: I buy Mephisto shoes every time I travel to Europe. Mephisto shoes are elegant, comfortable, and long lasting. I have shoes that are 4-5 years old and they are still in a very good condition. And I live in Canada where the amount of salt on street can kill your shoes in a week. Unfortunately, this store falls short on two levels: first, the styles are quite limited. Second, even if you find the style you like, there is a 99% chance that they will not have your size. Especially, if you wear the most common size 8. As a result, I end up buying Mephisto shoes on Ebay or elsewhere. Very disappointing.",negative
Open Sundays and offers a high level of customer service if you shop during the week They are expensive but very well made and will last a long time,positive
"Each time my wife or I visit Mephisto in Rosedale we really enjoy the selection and experience in general. We've found the staff the be very helpful and accommodating. The shoes have, over time, greatly helped alleviate my wife's plantar fasciitis. They're also the only shoes I trust when I know I'm going to be walking a significant distance in the city.",positive
"How does MetroPark inventory work? When we came in, we saw a sign that announced that the store was closing for good in two days. Is it then reasonable for one to expect really, really cheap prices? Perhaps if this was a ""normal"" store. I saw a cute dress that I really wanted up until I saw the $70 tag. Pass!",negative
out of all the metro park stores ive been including the ones in vegas this was probably the worse one ive been too. the workers looked miserable to be there and yeah thats all,negative
This is my new favorite clothing store! The prices are a little steep but the fashion is unique and fits my very picky taste! The staff is helpful and there are always a good amount of sale items! Now if there was only one in Sacramento!,positive
"I can't believe no one has reviewed this place....I had the best shopping experience here and spent more on one shopping trip than I ever had in my life--but that's a good thing. As I window-shopped at the Miracle Mile, I spotted Metropark (which I'd never been in before) and thought I'd continue to window-shop. James asked me if I needed help and what style I like...he started a room for me and gave me clothes to try on. I normally wouldn't have picked out most of the pieces he gave me, like the True Religion jeans, and the Frankie B. cut-offs, but I loved 99% of his suggestions and did NOT end up buying half of my picks. What I'm trying to say is I don't know how to dress, but James knows what's best for me!",positive
"One star for having the most random yet super cute goodies that did not break my pocketbook (and of course, lots of other ones that would have, for me to just moon over...) One star for rockin' the boombastic 'icanthearyou' music that encourages you to continue quickly piling things into your arms since you are unable to carry on any sort of conversation with the gal pal who accompanied you into the store. One star for the cute punked out little sales chick who...while she did not think I was a size Small, definitely agreed I was a Medium...and was super helpful about not pointing out that I was probably 10 years too old to be shopping in there. One star for the sale rack, where I managed to find not one, but two super cute tops... one of which I have already worn and gotten rave reviews from the coworkers on. Gotta love the sales. Before this visit I'd only heard about MetroPark in mags accompanied by bright photos of crazy ass looking jeans....or in random convos I'd catch snatches of. Now I have seen those funky rhinestone covered jeans in person and I just gotta say...WHO WEARS THOSE???? BTW this place is in the Miracle Mile Mall. Which is ... not a mile...but certainly fun to shop in.",positive
"This place is like walking back in time. Kind of expertise and service of days past. Massive selection of hats for all styles and sizes. What I was really interested in was a repair. Ray was able to stretch my hat to size and fix the band in ten minutes time. These guys are true craftsman, glad to see these types of tradesmen still exist. Note - their storefront is a bit hard to find, it's actually wrapped around to the side of the building. Well worth the trip. Will def be back.",positive
"I have been going to Mike the Hatter since the 1980's when they were in downtown Cleveland. Going to the store is a pleasure in itself. Fair prices, great selection of quality merchandise, and six stars out of five for the customer service!",positive
I was in Cleveland on vacation and found this place by accident and Marlon (Mike) answered the phone when I called and gave me directions and took excellent care of me-I left a very happy customer with my hat that I wanted and great prices-Marlon will get you exactly what you want-Diamond,positive
"Worst experience ever! I've been investing in and wearing top of the line dress hats for 30 years. So my wife ordered a hat from here as a Christmas gift for me and the nightmare began! The hat came slightly bent out of shape but the packaging was intact so I called on Tuesday the 22nd and spoke to one of the guys and he proceeded to tell me that the hat was ""good"" when they shipped it and became argumentative. He was rude and arrogant like it's impossible for them to make a mistake so I was done with him. I asked to speak with a manager and spoke to Marlon. He assured me that he is a hat connoisseur and they're the best in the Midwest. I told him that his employee was disrespectful and the hat was bent and too small. He apologized and assured me that he would get a new one, stretch it to my size, expedite shipping on Friday the 26th and refund the return shipping cost as soon as we emailed him the receipt. We shipped the hat the same day and emailed him the receipt and tracking #. I called them repeatedly for tracking number for new hat and confirmation of refund but got the run around, ""leave us a call back#"" no call. I called again, ""the girl that does the numbers us not in, I'll text her and call you back"" no call. After I called them yet again they finally gave me a tracking# but for a package already delivered somewhere in Ohio, I'm in California. I called back on Monday the 28th, they gave me the right tracking# and said they received the return. Fishy, I'll get to that. I finally get the new ""stretched"" hat and it has the bend in the exact same spot! Coincidence? The hat still did not fit because it has a flexible wire band internally (to adjust the brim) around the entire hat that doesn't stretch as it doesn't allow the felt material to stretch. He KNEW that all along because I called yet again and told him it still doesn't fit and he said ""Yeah the wire band doesn't stretch much."" It doesn't stretch at all. SHADY! My wife investigated the ship dates and found that they shipped the second hat on Tuesday the 29th a day AFTER they received the return when he promised me he would ship it as soon as we emailed him confirmation of return. LIAR! Needless to say that it's taken over 2 weeks for them to process the return shipping reimbursement and they just processed it today for an amount LESS than the invoice states. JEEZ! What an experience. These guys have no integrity and no class. Waste of time. I usually shop online at Hats Plus in Chicago, excellent service! Marlon the manager tried to trick me with the same hat I sent back. I'm sending the faulty, defective, not stretched hat back and we'll see how long it'll take for them to refund our money",negative
"Great customer service. Went in, got shown the exact hat style I was looking for, and left as a very satisfied customer with a cool new hat.",positive
"The manager, James, helped me tremendously. I have a XXL hat size so it's hard to get anything cool but I left Mike The Hatter's with 2 great hats. James rolled the brim on one more for me and steamed another one a bit larger for a perfect fit. Huge selection, good prices, and great customer service.",positive
"Where to begin?! I was looking for a distressed top hat. I found 2 online but couldn't decide which to order and both were small for me. So I began my online search for a company that could possibly stretch either hat. It was then that I found ""Mike the Hatter"". I called with 101 questions, everything from the amount of stretching they could do on a hat, how much it would cost, the turn around time, the shipping cost and even their opinion on which hat they thought was the best find! Can you believe it? He said sure send me the 2 pictures and I'll give you my opinion! Talk about customer service! Marlon (Mike) was the most pleasant person to work with. I live in San Diego but if I ever was in the area I would definitely drop in to meet the guy! I can't begin to say enough about my experience!",positive
"Outstanding work. My fedora was structurally sound but very, very dirty. I thought it maybe could get clean enough so that a person with mediocre vision wouldn't notice the stains in artificial light. They got the hat completely clean, so that it actually looks new (even in sunlight). Took about two weeks or so, including time on its way to and fro. Not cheap, but an excellent price/value ratio IMHO.",positive
I worked with James on having him clean my favorite hat. James was very helpful and responsive . My hat came back better than ever and even smelled nice as well . I will be using there service again the future.,positive
"Ive had my Tweed Flat Cap for almost four years now and over that time it had built up a substantial amount of grime and smoke damage so I figured it was way over due for a cleaning. These guys did good, the cap looks practically new and had no signs of any shrinkage. The shop probably has one of the better hat selections around and the prices arnt bad. If youre looking for a different hat Id say check them out, just call to find out if they are still in downtown Cleveland as they are about to move.",positive
Great stylist. Michelle is the best. She always takes an amazing amount of time. I've been coming here for a year. Great salon.,positive
It was my first time at Mosaic. Salon looked clean and welcoming. My friend recommended Crystal Ghassedi and I absolutely do not regret trying her out. She provides not only excellent service but also builds personal relationship with her clients. Safe to say I'm completely satisfied with her services and definitely will be back!!,positive
"Came to Mosaic Salon to get highlights done and was serviced by Tam Dao. He did an amazing job, was very understanding and knowledgeable as to what I wanted and helped me decide when I was in doubt. I'm so happy with the results!",positive
"Got my hair done last Friday for my baby shower and it came out better than I anticipated! I have been dying my hair black for over 5 years and have had the worst trouble changing the color! I've tried ombré twice and the places I went just damaged my hair and left me cutting so much of my hair as well! I did a balayage and it looks great! Defiantly will need one more session to really get the color I want but overall I'm very please my hair is still long and healthy couldn't of asked for a better job! Desaray did my hair and she's lovely! Very good price the place is wonderful when you walk in all the girls are very sweet too! Just a very welcoming, clean & beautiful environment! I will be back very soon!!",positive
Ciera did a better job on my hair than anyone else ever has. She actually listened to me! My number one fear is walking out and my hair looking totally different two weeks later. Ciera literally texted me to check in and make sure I was still happy with my results. AND I AM!!!! For the first time my hair is colored evenly and exactly the tones I wanted and it's been about a month with no fading :) such a sweet heart. So glad I found her!!!!! She really cares!,positive
"CIERA U ARE MY QUEEN seriously my hair looked like a year old mop and now I have this stunning art on my head thanks to Miss Ciera. The salon is awesome, very elegant. Ciera is the sweetest and kept every minute of the 7 hours I spent with her entertaining. Also fair pricing.",positive
"I LOVE my new haircut. I followed Beth Raskin on IG (@weubly) for a long time before making an appointment for just a cut. I have several problem-hair issues including that I am in the process of growing out severe damage/breakage. She was very patient and knowledgeable when discussing my options. Her assistant, Michelle, is also very nice and gave me a good massage/wash. I have not felt this good about my hair in a long time. Thanks so much, Beth and Michelle!",positive
"Tam Dao is AMAZING! I got my hair done Feb 18th w Tam at this salon and I couldn't be more happier w my results! I have a girlfriend that has been going to him for a few years now and I've always loved her hair and I myself have been wanting to go lighter. So I finally did and let me tell you, it was everything I expected it to be! (In a good way) he really delivered the results I wanted, I've never gone lighter so I was so nervous yet excited and he's really made me fall in love with my hair! He tells you exactly what he's doing before he does it and I love that. I recommended him! I would go back if I decide to go lighter :)",positive
"I was looking for a new salon and I was lucky enough to be scheduled with Cori. She listened to what I wanted for my hair. Going to a new salon is nerve racking bc even though your hair will grow back you still don't want to walk around with a messed up hair do for months. Recently I just had 5 inches chopped off and colored and highlighted - she did an AMAZING JOB!! People are still telling me what a great job she did a month and a half later! Love the Salon it is always and clean and welcoming, I have never had a problem scheduling an appointment with Cori - Im a spur of the momement type person when it comes to wanting my hair done and she has always been able to squeeze me in.",positive
"It's not about how clean or how salon looks. It's about customer service something that is priceless. Yet I'm very unhappy with Kirsten whom scheduled an appointment with and did not follow through yet she must learn that you don't just set an appt with a client then you wash your hands and say I can't do your hair because you have extensions. Totally Rude! She never made the effort to really work with me. She knew from the beginning I had extentions, yet she just brushed me under the carpet and didn't apply professional and customer service. The fact that she thought that I was going to take this lightly and not complain . You are Defenitely not a professional yet Unclassy, and uncustomer service. Don't trust her she doesn't follow through. She is not credible!",negative
Awesome salon! Very clean and has an adorable little boutique in the front of the shop. Love my stylist here! Everyone here is super friendly and talented- you won't be disappointed!,positive
"Trina is my stylist, and I've been going to her for three years. They say that the good stylists always group together. I've always had a great cut/highlight, with great results. My style's ranged from a bob to long, and its always gorgeous out of the salon. She keeps in mind that I'm low-mainentance, and cuts around my laziness.",positive
"For as much as I love shopping at My Sister's stores this one has to be the worst, many of the employees here are less than friendly and have little to no customer service skills. Don't even think about asking the ladies at the intake counter about any of the items pending pricing. The best they can do is repeatedly comment on what they don't know. No offers to take a number just again and again we don't know. How many times do they need to repeat. When I asked ""is that the best she could do, couldn't you offer to take my number and call"". She returned ""I was getting to that. ""REALY, I could hardly tell. I guess I did't present myself as someone worth giving service to. My last visit wasn't the first time I experience poor unfriendly service at this location and from the same people. Honestly they act in a manner that is unacceptable. I will not tolerate being treated in this manner.",negative
"I used to really like these stores but lately I have been really disappointed. If you take stuff into sell they tell me it must be no older than 5 years old and worth more than $50 however, the store is like 90% stuff that is definitely OLDER than 5 years old!!! I then took in a table that i had only had for a year and they put such a low price on it that it wasn't even worth my trouble to take it over here. The same goes for the clothing stores, they act like your stuff is dirt and deny it but then you see stuff all over the store that is much cheaper brands than what you were trying to consign. They are really shady. If you want to take in Gucci that you paid $500 for and are okay in getting $50 for it, this is the place for you.",negative
"The BEST consignment store in the Valley! The staff is so friendly and helpful. I had to laugh at the reviewer who called the manager, Tom a ""crab""- He is anything BUT that! Given the amount of merchandise that moves through this store on a daily basis I think he does an amazing job. As anywhere, I find that if you are a nice person...people are nice back!!",positive
"The manager of this store, Tom, is a crab. It is easy to see that he does not enjoy his job. The other employees that work at N. Scottsdale store are all so nice, but I will not shop or consign here again.",negative
"I love, love, love this place. I am a huge fan. They have amazing finds, great prices and their customer service is five star. Christine is so nice, a true pleasure to deal with. I know I will be making many more purchases here. This store is a gem. SOOO glad I found them. I am totally addicted to their website also, a small teaser of all they have to offer. Ask for Christime, and happy shopping!",positive
"Extremely disappointed and would not recommend consigning fairly new and nice furniture items.. I brought in 3 pieces of furniture that were purchased within a 2 year time period and were still in the store catalogs. I gave them the receipts and they had priced them less than 1/2 of what they were purchased for and that was okay, but what disturbed me was, they were marked down within 2 weeks of being in the store and I was told that they had a lot of interest and it was priced to high. The two desirable pieces sold as soon as they were marked down and the 3rd piece which was less desirable was never marked down ???. I still can't figure that one out. When I questioned the man on the floor, his response was we need to price that down too. Very arrogant attitude and I learned my lesson the hard way. There are many Consignment stores out there and they wait 60 days before they mark down an item and you split the purchase 50/50. If it's a nice item, I'd go else where..",negative
"My favorite consignment store, hands down. It does get a little overstuffed in here, but I find the pricing and selection to be the be best. I stop in once a week or so, and frequently make purchases. One of my friends scored an amazing mid-century dining set here. Pricing is generally realistic--I'm parsimonious to put it nicely, and I still buy here! They have sorted out a problem that arose a while back with some consigned carpets that reeked of animal urine. Someone must do a sniff test now before accepting. Good idea! The staff is nice. I like the assortment of accessories. It's apparent that a lot of thought and research goes into arriving at prices that are fair to consignors but appeal to shoppers. Inventory turns over fast. Good store.",positive
"It's amazing the crap people will buy. One person's trash is another person's treasure? I believe so. I sold over $1,000 of my crap at this store. No kidding...and it went fast! My Sisters Attic is clearly MY gold mine, why is everyone looking in the Superstitions? This one is prolly a bit smaller than others, but the stuff moves. Garage sale? Who needs the headache...",positive
"This place annoys me. The employees are rude. They don't move out of the way to let you shop. They just continue restocking and cleaning the racks. They make you wait if you're just cashing $$ out on your account. No one was in the store, Roseanne greeted me and I told her I was cashing out, she asked me to wait while she finished what she was doing. That's fine, but I waited like 5 mins at the counter while she just reattached tags to merchandise. I thought she was a bit rude honestly. I don't like shopping here. Deals aren't even good. You can shop at outlet stores, and buy the same stuff brand new for better prices than this used over priced stuff.",negative
Customer service was less than acceptable last time I visited this store. I have been bringing clothes here for years to sell and currently have items here for sale. I thought id check what my balance was as I just visited Trader Joe's next door but the woman behind the counter seemed annoyed I was asking her to check My account. She asked if I knew what was on my account. Um no that's why I'm asking and informed me I could do it online now. She was condescending and rude throughout the entire interaction. I'll be taking my clothes elsewhere to sell In the future.,negative
If you love thrift shopping but don't have the time to dig for treasure go here. I have never once left unhappy with the selection!!! Even fluctuating between a size 2 and a 10 I've always found clothes that just make me feel so beautiful. And honestly it's the same price for most things as savers! Love love love this store!!!,positive
"I have been shopping at this consignment boutique since it opened. It has everything from Chanel to Lululemon and everything in between. Great selection of clothing and accessories, all at a fraction of retail. I love this concept because you find things you don't find anywhere else, items that have been purchased all over the US and abroad. I don't live in AZ anymore but love this boutique so much that I come back to Phoenix just to shop. On my most recent visit I received customer service that exceeded my already high expectations. Thank you Alexis for storing my luggage. I shopped til I dropped. I'll be back. :)",positive
"Awful selling Louis Vuitton as Real when fake. Also, saw manager mean to employees. Now, employees are leaving, maybe you need to Let management go",negative
"I was just in there looking for a dress and had three in hand when I went to the dressing room. There three works around the area. All ignored me, but all were attending one lady. I don't care who she was or how much she was spending, it was rude to disregarding someone else. I put the dress back and walked out of the store.",negative
"The 20th Street location is by far my favorite of all My Sister's Closet stores. The store itself has a great selection and boutique-like charm, but what I feel truly sets this location apart is the staff. On multiple occasions I have been assisted by the most courteous and genuine salesperson, a woman I later learned was the store manager, Alexis. Alexis and her staff clearly have a great deal of retail experience, for they know the nuances of how to anticipate when a client needs assistance and when to allow them to shop freely. This location also has a great selection of pret-a-porter as well as some of the smaller niche brands, and all incredibly organized on shopable racks. I will say that I have never consigned with the company (because my own sister shops my closet!) but I have felt appreciated and treated very well as a customer. I look forward to each and every visit!",positive
"This is a small, tucked away location near By Nordstrom Rack and Snooze! It has a little less inventory than the one on Scottsdale are but WAY more helpful employees! Leah was kind enough to help me when the other store had overcharged me. She didn't have to do this but she went out of her way to make it right for me so that I didn't have to go back to the other store. This location had AMAZING brands and prices. I got Parker, Frame, IRO, DVF, Tory Burch, Lululemon and so much more. Even though this store has less inventory, I left with WAY more stuff! Thanks again ladies for helping me upgrade my closet and handle the issue from the other store!",positive
"Please do yourself a favor and DO NOT BUY OR CONSIGN with this merchant. These sisters are out to get you and your mighty dollar. Their consignment fees are absurd. Their pricing is so unrealistic and unfair across the board. I have sold and bought with them for a number of years until I woke up and realized that I was being ripped off. You can sell your items on ebay with ease and more money in your pocket. The staff is snotty, no matter what location you go to. Like they're doing you a favor. They are only nice to you when you're buying from them. When you're there to get money out of your account. They are cold and abrupt (all locations equally across the board). Very sneaky and underhanded business. Do not go! You will be disappointed.",negative
"For a consignment store it was not as exciting as I thought it would be. Especially with a Nordstrom Rack right there to try to have competitive pricing. Store was clean and organized but not as high quality or classy as I had read online it to be. Brands were here and there but the quality was a mix of NWT and past gently used. Two or three girls were working and not one of them said a single word to me or any other customers that I saw. I may take another look when I am back in town, and may not.",negative
"I been coming to my sisters closet for the longest time! You get pretty good deals especially for the name brands like Ann Taylor, Loft and Banana Republic. I did notice that the prices for the shirts have gone up. You use to be able to find shirts from $9-$10 and now a 95% of their shirts are $12.95. But it still has a nice clothing selection.",positive
"I was surprised to see reviews from disappointed customers but it seems like some of them were related to their experience consigning clothes here rather than buying clothes here. What's bad for the consigner is good for me!! (low prices) I'm a L-XL and scored here with a dress, sweater and 2 pairs of shoes for $60. I wasn't sure about the dress but when I got it on it was flattering. You have to pick through everything and try on everything that you think MIGHT work and you end up finding just a few things that do... but that's why consignment store shopping is fun! And I thought this was a solid consignment store. I don't see an option to add a photo of my haul to this review but I'll add it in the photos for this location.",positive
"One of my favorites places to shop and find unique clothing to add to my wardrobe...love, love, love shopping at My Sister's Closet!",positive
I have been consigning for more than 2 decades and most recently here and my experience has not been the best. From items being dropped off never making it on my account to items being priced at pennies to the dollar is unacceptable. I have to add how rude the manager is I don't know her name but I just tried to cash out the remainder of my account and was told they are closed and the door shut on my face. Well bitch I know this but maybe if I was able to cash out on the men's side I would not have to even have contact with your rude ass. I will be visiting the store tomorrow just to give her an ear full... very inconvenient and definitely not how you treat shoppers nor consigners.,negative
"Their advertising is very misleading. When a ""half-off all sweaters"" lands in your inbox, one gets to the store and notes the exceptions are not only designer labels, somewhat understandable, but one has to read every tiny label to determine if a top is labeled a ""sweater"". I choose three ""sweaters"" and none qualified. At my age, I think I know what a sweater is! I am not returning ever again. (Thank you for apologizing but the sweaters I selected fell into none of the categories you mentioned) This is a typical bait & switch advertising ploy---actually, it probably could be reported.",negative
"A long term consignor, I didn't really keep track of the items I brought in, or the individual amount received for them. I donate many things to charity, but take the more expensive things here. Well, I took a necklace, Honora pale green, freshwater pearls in their leather pouch into MSC. I paid $185 for them and had never worn them. I was paid $7.50 for the pearls!! It is my opinion, when there is an item one expects to sell for at least $85+, they should let you know, before giving them away for peanuts. I was not happy, although an employee called me after my inquiry as to what happened to the pearls. I think with designer clothes, one is better off sending them to The Real Real. They pay 70% and shipping. From now on I will donate all other items to charity and take the donation receipt, rather than feel as if I had been ""taken"". The staff is friendly for the most part, but many do not know quality when they see it, and reject things that would sell and are valuable.,The store is well organized, and I'm sure if you buy anything, you'll get a great deal-especially if you bought my pearls.",negative
"I had a very similar experience to Allison G. (review written on 9/16/2014). I went in to collect my money at My Sister's Closet at T&C today. I approached the sales gal standing at the register and explained to her what I was there to do. I was told to go to another register in a rather apathetic and dismissive demeanor. Prior to today, approx. 56 days ago, I took in 8 items to sell and 7 of them sold. They were decent labels (BCBG dresses, Coach purse, Elie Tahari skirt, Cache leather skirt, Italian suede blazer, Banana Republic skirt, etc.) and what I received in return in cash was $55. I asked Jenny (sales person) if I could take home my 1 remaining item and they wanted to charge me $5.00 to do so (and that charge will be going up soon according to Jenny and the sign she brusquely pointed to). It was because it was an item they had priced under $25. ""It's in the contract"" Jenny so gruffly explained. So when taking your clothes for consignment I highly suggest that you stay current on your contract so you know exactly what kind of exchange you will experience from them. Apparently they make changes to your contract whenever they see fit and do not notify you of the changes other than the signs they post in-store. Be cautious and informed before doing business here. I've had my account there for years and I've never felt so dismissed by the sales persons (esp. Jenny), so uninformed, and frankly, ripped off. Bottom-line: Doing business with My Sisters Closet feels bad. I will not be taking my items to be sold there to receive very little in return and to be treated so poorly for being a client of theirs. I'd rather donate my clothes to a good cause, get a tax write-off that I believe is a better financial decision and, more importantly, feel good about doing it.",negative
"Hey now... I stopped by My Sister's Closet on my way out of Last chance, as it is just literally a block or two away. They have some cute things in here, I scored a pair of Pilcro shorts for 10.00 as well as some Saucony running shoes for $12.00, not bad! This store is really small, and they have an odd mix of mall brand clothing all the way to higher end stuff. I saw a pair of size 9 tory burch miller sandals (brown brand new) for around $50.00, too bad they weren't my size or else I woulda snatched those bad boys up. Overall I think their selection is kinda small, I easily went through all the racks in 30 mins, if you have some time to kill you could get lucky and end up finding one or two things you really like.",positive
Super fun place to shop for high quality clothing and accessories at bargain prices. They have a large selection especially good for work clothes lots of suits and dresses. Good selection of evening clothes as we'll. beautiful jewelry too. Other locations in town a fun day to bit them all.,positive
"The gals buying are always super friendly and go over why some items weren't selected. I appreciate that. The manager is also quite friendly! SELLING CLOTHES Maybe because the area has more professional business women but I do well with certain items here. I bring my Ann Taylor and WHBM, along with Banana Republic and other decent work attire brands. BUYING CLOTHES I've found some great jeans in small sizes (24-25) here! R&R for $35. Yay!!",positive
"The ladies here are always so friendly and I often find designer items with the original hang tags on them (typically for less than 25% of the original price). I can't imagine what there is not to like! Scottsdale lacks a great designer discount store (so long, Loehmans), and this place really fills that role. Plus, the women who work here seem to really like clothes and to know a great deal on a consignment item when they see it. I have never had anything but a positive experience here. From vintage watches to Chanel suits to little cotton t-shirts, you are bound to find something fun and stylish here. (Chanel and St. John are not my thing, but there is plenty of that stuff, at outrageously low prices, if that is what you're looking for.) Do know that every trip to this store is something of a treasure hunt. They sell formal wear, career wear, outerwear, handbags, accessories, everyday clothing and jewelry, but it's best not to go in looking for something specific. You can expect to find on-trend items in an array of sizes...and at a fraction of the price you'd pay for them elsewhere.",positive
"A-ok, seems to be a fair description. I've found a few items by chance, but for the most part, I'm not that impressed with what this location carries. I can't imagine why someone would buy a used Tiffany necklace with someone else's initials on it, but ok... The best part of this location is that if you hit and miss, at least you have Trader Joes and Nordstrom Rack Backroom in the same plaza so that the trip isn't wasted.",negative
"Smaller sizes...not much for the plus or large crowd. Also, the staff is almost incredulously rude everytime I'm in here! I know people love it here, but it's like a very expensive Goodwill. The clothes and accessories are way overpriced for what you're getting! Save yourself some money and go down to the Goodwill at 16th St and Indian School. Also, if you have clothes to sell, don't get your hopes up. Gawd knows I've tried to figure out what they are looking for...when they did take a couple of my smaller size 12 sundresses to consign, they ended up giving them away to a thrift store for dogs (I shit you not) and didn't even bother to call me. I guess that's not their policy...if you consign here and they don't sell your stuff in whatever time frame they think they should, don't expect to ever get it back.",negative
"While I can't say I've ever actually purchased anything for myself, I keep coming back to My Sister's Closet. It's probably more the thrill of the hunt for that perfect (shirt/pants/jacket/etc) that keeps me interested. Maybe its just me, but they usually don't have much in my size. They do have plenty of Med - Large sizes and 35 - 40 waist pants. FYI MSC - I wear a 38s jacket, size S collared shirts, a 30ish waist with 29inch inseam, and size 7 1/2 - 8 shoe; just in case you were wondering. ;) My wife seems to have some luck though. She's found a few designer shirts, a couple pairs of 7 jeans, and even some cool Coach purses. I think this is definitely a better place for the female shopper. Best of luck to all you shoppers; and who knows, maybe you'll bump into me in there not buying something. :(",positive
"""Name brand clothing without the name brand price tag"" Although being male, My Sister's seems to be a big hit among the women in my family. I am related to shopaholics and bargain hunters and though it seems that these may be part of a genetic predisposition to the Asian gene on both sides of the family, you would think that I spend my weekends on this expensive past time. I don't. But I do enjoy finding my bargain name brands here which are plenty at Well Suited (Male counterpart to My Sister's Closet). By coming here, I not only save on $$, but save on time spent shopping all over malls and waiting for sales desired clothing. They do have spectacular sales about twice a year on the consigned articles up to another 70% off (usually in late January and August). This is to make room for new seasonal items. While others may cringe at the thought of wearing consigned clothing, it is their loss due to the amazing savings. I cannot speak on the consignment system as I have not brought in any of my clothing, but I can attest to the selection to buy which are great, clean, and organized; providing opportunity for us to wear name brand clothing without the name brand price. If you think this was useful, cool, or funny, please check below.",positive
"I love love love consignment stores...and walking in this store, the smell was great... however... I have to say i am disappointed with My Sister's Closet. I had heard such great things, so I was really excited to go. They did have some amazing designer purses, including a $3400 jimmy chu purse that was huge and gorgeous for $1899. The designer section clothing was hung on nice wooden hangers with their logo (Nice touch). However....... The items I saw around the store, and my friend with me agreed, seemed like more than 40% really were more appropriate for a thrift store, and a lot of the items were really dirty (and still had high prices). You could see food stains on a dooney bag.. a coach wristlet, black, had white food smeared all over it... still highly priced for as dirty as it is. The thing is... even if it is a brand.. sometimes your store reputation is worth more than the 10 bucks you'll make by selling something dirty. Just my .02. I saw sensors put though jeans pockets, wallets (in the leather!) and other questionable placements. When I asked about it.. the sales person just said, well maybe there is someone new who does not put it in the right place. That damages items people are buying, and they may not realize the big holes placed by those sensors. I loved there ""on the web"" tags. I've never seen that before, but they are really pretty and catch your eye if you want to take a closer look. I prefer consignment stores to identify the sizes on the hanger by color coding or some such to make it easier to find my sizes. I get bored really fast trying to find my size.. As a consumer, I would have spent more time looking had I been able to really scan the racks easier for size. The shoes are nicely organized.... and clearly labeled. They were not over crowded so it was easy to see the shoes. There are some positives.. I purchased a le sportsac tiny bag for 9.99, it was new so i do feel it was a good deal. but really be careful what you buy.. The prices for the purses seemed high for used resale and their obvious usage stains.",negative
"I never had a sister...but I remember while I was still very young being able to rummage through my moms closet... I remember this cool blue velvety/terry cloth track suit she had that I really liked....ahh the '80s...but then I hit the 4th grade.... The 2 times I have been in here the only things I found of interest were some of the shoes and the handbags and purses. As for the clothes, they really don't carry anything in plus sizes. Or at least not for plus size under 50 years old and even then the selection is slim. For those under a size 10 you may be able to find a few more things. I find the prices to be reasonable (although I have yet to buy anything.) It's a clothing consignment store so you have folks bringing in their stuff for evaluation. They seem to like Chicos, and there are racks of Chicos stuff. So if that is your thing you may be able to put together an outfit or 3. Or you may be able to sell your stuff to them. But they do have other high end designer brands here, without much looking. While it's not for me, I do feel it is worthy of checking out.",negative
Found some great deals! They had shirts with additional discounts getting them down to about $3 and the clothes all seemed in very good condition. Bought BCBG blouses and a cute summer dress that I used right away to wear to Mill Ave. with friends. Only a slight wait for a fitting room and the lighting isn't all that great but the prices are good. Staff is friendly too. Will be going back soon.,positive
"This is the best one yet (out of all of the My Sister's Closets). I've found so many yummy things here. Cashmere sweaters, designer jeans (Sevens, AG and People's Republic), Coach sandals, a Prada moon bag and some Juicy Couture dresses - and those are just the highlights. They're very picky what they accept when you consign, but that's what makes them a good consignment shop and their prices are really pretty good. I always stop here after Last Chance. It completes my shopping day and a good deal makes me happy. Forget Prozac, what we need are Prada bags for $200 (it was a super sale day - and I'm not on Prozac, just being facetious).",positive
"Oh yeah, do I love My Sister's Closet!!! Some of my favorite duds were found here. Now let's get this straight: like any consignment store, it's hit or miss--you may find a fabulous St. John's suit here one day and dreck the next. But for those who are into cheap duds that look like you found them at Saks or Nordstrom [and NOT Nordstrom's Last Chance!!!] and for those who are patient enough to keep coming back--and back--and back again, you CAN find something here. Just like any other thrift store, though it seems like we real-sized women get short shrift. But maybe that's because they're not into cool threads like I am...but I have still found some great stuff here, so keep coming. And coming back. And I may start consigning myself, so all you fashionistas out there who think that size 2 means that a girl's just not getting enough to eat should come here and pick up all my old designer duds that I've grown tired of.",positive
"I enjoyed my experience at NYCSOLE. We didn't receive the name of the girl who helped us but she was very sweet and helpful. Shoes were 50% off so my boyfriend got two and I also got two. Which were a total of $100 a lot of sizes were gone, but the girl was patient to help us find the shoes we wanted in our sizes. She also explained to me the shoes were final sale but who would even want to return such a good deal. I'm a local so I will definitely be returning soon. :)",positive
"Terrible manager owner, extremely rude...great shows ....very nice lady helping us . Even she was very scared of the manager/owner...horrible attitude and only took cash ! I guess cause it cost him to use credit cards...there were no signs that said cash only but at the end he only wasted cash . He really was a mean man...do not shop there",negative
"This will be my first yelp review: I visited the Las Vegas store and was pleasantly greeted and helped by a wonderful human being who gave me her feedback (unfortunately I do not remember the sales associate's name). 5 stars for her in store service. I was told if these shoes do not fit (I was surprising my girlfriend) that I would be able to ship these shoes back and return them with free shipping (I live in Los Angeles), to which I agreed. The shoes did not fit, so now the return process begins (I should have known better)... I contact the David Z website, I am told I can return the merchandise and I was also told I will need to pay the shipping cost, which I find completely unacceptable for the following reasons: 1. I was told by in-store personnel I would be able to return free of charge before 30 days 2. The David Z web site states the following: a. Once we have reviewed and approved your case we will send you a pre-paid shipping label. b. You can return your purchase for up to 30 days from the purchase date. c. Product(s) must be in the condition you received them and in the original box and/ or packaging. d. Return shipping is 100% FREE e. If you are not completely satisfied with your purchase you can return your order for free within 30days of your purchase date (Returns must be unworn, in the state you received them, and in the original packaging). f. You will be provided with a pre-paid UPS or similar domestic label to return the purchase to us.* I attempted to contact the corporate representatives via email and via phone to further discuss this matter, to which I have heard no response back in either form of communication. Pro-tip - ignoring a customer doesn't really solve the problem...go figure it only upsets them more? Interesting concept. I later found the exact same shoes at Nordstrom for 40% off. I would highly recommend individuals stay away from this ill managed company that fluffs impressive claims but do not follow through. Competition is fierce and customer service is everything. I'd much rather do business with a larger competitor, than support a smaller business, when this smaller business has really nothing to offer other than uncompetitive pricing, false advertisement and poor corporate level customer service. Thanks for playing David Z Nyc...",negative
"The shoes we bought broke within minutes of wearing. We tried to return them the same day and were told the manager would come and discuss the issue with us in about an hour. After two and a half hours of waiting the manager called the attendant and said we were not to get an exchange or refund under any terms because the shoes were worn too much. Despite returning within hours and not even having walked to dinner in them, the shoes lacked durability and the store refused to even meet us half way.",negative
"Shoes are overpriced, even for the strip. The workers were helpful, but I took an issue with the Fat manager in the store. He was very unwelcoming and rude. I don't know if he was having a bad day or not, but it's no excuse and now I'll never go back",negative
"I had been lusting over a particular pair of shoes for months and finally decided it was time to splurge and get them. I originally went to another store that I knew carried the shoes, but left when I could not get any service from the employees... Carlos was the employee that helped me at David Z NYC. I wasn't sure what size I needed, Carlos got out three different shoes for me to try on, including the store sample. Once I figured out which size fit best, Carlos rang me up and what do you know, the shoes were on sale! I think I have a new favorite shoe store!!",positive
"This is another one of those must stop by places whenever I go to Vegas. At first glance it may appear as though the store appeals to the younger crowd but once you get inside the store, you realize they appeal to everyone. The service is great and not pushy at all. I love the fact that when I bring shoes home from this place, I always get raves from others about it!",positive
"Wow felt like I was invisible in there. Didn't even get a hello. They said hello to customer that came in after me, didn't even ask if I had any questions. It looked like there was plenty of employees that could have helped me, not like they were super busy or anything. I was actually interested in a fairway wood and the vapor pro irons but it looked they didn't care that I was in there. Well looks like they lost a potential customer cause I love Nike.",negative
"While vacationing, I wandered in and found a pair of golf shoes that I like. Not carrying my desired color, the employee offered to order them online and ship directly to me. They arrived a couple weeks later and didn't fit correctly. One of the shoes had a ridge that I could feel under the foot. They were clearly asymmetric in their fit. I called the store and was told by a different employee that I'd have to pay to ship them back to the store. Since they're not affiliated with Nike and are the only Nike Golf store in the country, I had no other options. So even though they were defective, I'd have to pay to remedy the situation. That's bull.",negative
"Terrible service. First, I am staying at Mandalay Bay. In the room there is a booklet of offers. One of them is for a free swing analysis and 20% off at NikeGolf. The first time I went into the store with my wife the sales clerk was alone. I inquired about the golf analysis and wide shoes. He said he was alone in the store and couldn't go to the back room or do the golf Analysis and asked me to come back later. My wife stopped in later while she was shopping (visit 2) and found out they do have wide shoes. I was able to go back the next day (visit 3) and was told again that the sales clerk was alone and I could come back in 45 minutes. I returned again (visit 4). Finally, there were two people in the store and they could help me. So now I've shown a lot of interest in shopping at this store and one of the clerks was there each time so knew the interest. So now I inquired about wide golf shoes and the swing analysis. I was then told they no longer do the free analysis and they didn't know why the advertisement was in the rooms. The clerk then said they did have some wide shoes, but was vary reluctant to help. She finally brought me one pair of wide shoes, and said there might have more in the back. While I was trying on the first pair of shoes I was expecting her to get more shoes to try on. Nope, she didn't. It became vary clear that they didn't have any interest in helping me find the right shoes. After I came in four times to talk to them you'd think they would bend over backwards because I would probably buy from them.",negative
"My review isn't so much about the store and what their selection is like its more about the service I received at the store, My husband and I are in town for a large Kia convention and I forgot to pack him some casual socks. So while he was at his event at the Mandalay Bay I went in to get him a pair of $7.50 socks. The cashier was helping a customer and I waited and waited as they decided what golf balls they wanted. The lady spent about $100 in products she paid with a visa and left. I went to pay for the socks a total of $8.11. I had to use my husbands card because I had lost mine well he asks me for ID I explained that it was my husbands card because I lost mine he wouldn't take it, I asked to charge it to my room he wouldn't do it either cause I wasn't on the reservation, finally I just paid with another card and left. Mind you we have the same last name i had the room key and the envelope for my room key, i left pretty upset because why wasn't the customer in front of me who spent a bit more than I did asked for ID and I was? Just because its a woman's name on the card doesn't mean it's hers! I am all for security and checking ID and I would've been totally fine if he would've just asked her for her ID. Customers should all be treated the same if you're going to ask one customer for ID you should ask them all!",negative
For all things Nike this store is pretty nice. It's a bit pricey but the fact you can get club fitted here makes it nice. If you have chips in your pocket make a stop to get your Tiger on.,negative
"I love golf....I have been playing for a while now but Tiger Woods I definitely am not... and my handicap leaves something to be desired but I love playing the game nonetheless. I was recently invited to play in a small friendly competition and gladly accepted. So I figured that I needed to dust off and take inventory of all my golfing gear because I haven't played in a while and needed to be prepared....soon after, I realized that my putter was missing, my bag was ragged and needed some help, and I was in desperate need of some new threads to show off on the course with as well. So I came here.... I love Nike products and think they are of great quality but what I didn't realize is that I was going to need to give the blood of my future first born and sign my soul away just get a putter. Man....the prices were ridiculous!! So overpriced.....and to think I actually wanted to buy a new shirt and bag on top of the new putter that would have cost me more than next month's rent....crazy!! But needless to say the store was beautiful. Selection of all things golf is any golfers dream but I'd rather spend my money at Sports Chalet at a cheaper price for my golf supplies any day.",negative
"I love Nordstrom, but Nordstrom Southpark is a bit of a ""swing and a miss"". Four stars feels generous, but three stars seems too harsh; too bad you can't give halves. Their shoe selection is out of this world fabulous, but the clothing selection leaves a lot to be desired - it is minimal. I also felt as though the customer service was a bit lacking from the typical Nordstrom experience. The store is on the smaller side with the majority of the ground floor being taken up by cosmetics. All of the women's clothing is upstairs. They have all of your Nordstrom ""departments"" (point of view, encore, bp., dresses, active wear, collectors, etc.); however, each one has only a very small selection... the largest selection of styles was probably in dresses. I would like to give a special nod to the ebar. The baristas were friendly and quick, the area was clean, and my latte tasted great.",positive
"I love shopping at Nordstrom... the customer service and policies are just a notch above other retailers. This store is much like others beautiful, clean, and a simple floor plan with directives at the base of each escalator. Anytime I have needed help at this location it's been a good experience. Namely, I was searching for some jewelry for my wedding rehearsal dinner and day-of. The woman behind the counter was so extremely patient and kind as I tried on earring after earring. She also gave me great advice. I love each piece I bought. Most recently, I went in looking for kids Ray Bans - unfortunately they don't carry them. But the women who helped me ran a search on the computer first and tried to help me find something that would have fit better, if not the same. I will always be a Nordstrom shopper!",positive
Where is the 3rd floor of SouthPark Nordstrom? I have never gone to a Nordstrom the house no product available to buy nothing in the few immediately designers that this Norstrom's in Charlotte carries are awful there's nothing colorful every thing is gray black navy blue and burgundy even when it was summertime those were the only colors that this Norstrom would carry please build a third floor onto this Norstrom so the people can actually have designers to shop,negative
"Let me just say I love Nordstrom HOWEVER my recent visit to the Nordstrom Lancome makeup counter was extremely subpar. I was approached by a young lady who referred a young man to me...someone who apparently knew about Lancome. Finally after waiting 5+ minutes for him to stop talking to a fellow coworker he came over to help me with my purchase. I was in need of a gift for my mother's birthday. I knew I wanted some Lancome makeup/foundation but was unsure of which one I wanted or their benefits. He showed little concern. I told him to use my skin color as reference so he proceeded to dab my face with a product. Not once did he tell me the benefits of the product, what he was using, the color... zilch. He just wanted to get me a product and send me on my way. Hindsight I should have left the counter from the start. I'll think twice before I go back to the makeup counter at Nordstrom. I should have, could have, my bad... my fault I wasn't a bit more assertive.",negative
"Always very helpful staff. Phill, in the men's department, knows his profession well and remembers me when I come in. My wife had not shopped there prior to today. She found helpful staff that aided in the purchase of a Barbour jacket.",positive
Love this store and their customer service! This is the place I like to go back again and again! Think of shopping- Hands down the first choice. Good Job for the team South Park Nordstrom,positive
"HIT OR MISS SERVICE. The service at this Nordstrom can be hit or miss. Some times they are really helpful with me and my girlfriend. Sometimes I'm allowed in the changing room to see what she has tried on. But several times I have been told to wait outside the changing room and once even to wait AWAY from the changing room in the chairs 30 feet away. Really Nordstrom. They do not say Men or Women or Child changing rooms.... If you have a problem with me there, put up some signage so I can't make a case as to why I want to stand there.",negative
"I love Nordstrom, I use to avoid this department store because I thought they would be too pricey for me but they always have great sales, selection, and services. Today I used a makeup stylist to get my makeup done for my birthday. Stylist are free but they suggest you buy an item. Terri craft was amazing and before I was even done so many people were complementing me. She was so personable and fun to work with. I will definitely be back to get my makeup but done in the future !",positive
"Nordstrom is the best department store out there. Excellent selection and great customer service. They have a stellar return policy, one of the best in the industry. Their semi-annual sales are great too.",positive
I am extremely disappointed with the service today at Nordstrom... The service is what usually brings me in but today it was disappointing... I will give them another chance because of the great service they usually provide. The purse my wife opened this morning for Christmas turned out to be a returned purse... Had candy wrappers and hair inside it... Returned it and the management felt bothered by us bringing it back in....,negative
"Nordstrom is my favorite department store, hands down. The one at South Park is just the right size, so it feels like you're shopping in a simultaneously large and cozy store. It's luxurious but doesn't feel uptight. The selection of clothing is beautiful and high-quality. Every department is very well-maintained. Nordstrom prides itself on delivering great service, and it certainly is fantastic here. Try to find Jennifer in the shoe department, because she is just excellent. She is what all sales associates should be. My size wasn't in stock, so she placed an order and had it shipped to my house free of charge. Also, the coffee at the entrance on the first floor is top-notch. Stop and get some to sip on while you shop. Unlike most other department stores, Nordstrom just feels serene. Shopping can be exhausting and stressful, but Nordstrom somehow manages to make it a different, positive experience.",positive
"This place is ridiculously expensive. Also, the staff are a little rude. I needed help finding some things and the lady I asked looked at me like I just didn't belong there, and then walked away before she even finished answering my question. I don't think I'll be back, it's just not worth the money or the hassle.",negative
I love Nordstom. I like most that it is not a super crowded department store. The sales staff are very personable and not pushy. I love that you can order online (for free shipping) and return to the store. I usually stop here first before going to the other little stores.,positive
Worst customer service at the jewelry/watch counter I've ever experienced. Girl was absolutely no help. She wanted to direct me to a kiosk in the mall to fix my MK watch. But she didn't even know the name or where the this kiosk was located. I bought my watch from this store specifically because I was told their customer service was superior when it came to their merchandise and so I would not have to get anything repaired or replaced at a rinky-dink kiosk in the mall. I will not be returning.,negative
"I was here to return a dress I ordered online. I ordered a size too small... Tear. The dress was too tight... One to many pieces of pizza and I needed a size bigger! I went in to the topshop section and the girl at the counter, Lindsay, was awesome! She called around to other stores and found my size. They are shipping the larger (bummer) size straight to my house! Super easy and painless! Thanks Lindsay! I love Nordstrom!",positive
"I have been on the hunt for knee high black riding boots since August. I have bought and returned 2 pairs already and was checking out the Nordstrom website when I decided to just head to the store during my lunch break. I have to say the customer service was really excellent! I was helped by Shane and we talked for a few minutes about what I was looking for and once he got an idea for the style I wanted he went in search of all the boots he could find in my size. He came back with a good mix of high and low priced boots and I didn't feel like he was going to pressure me to go for a more expensive pair. He sat there and took out each pair and put them back in the box when I was done, made polite small talk. Such a contrast from when I went to another department store and they basically threw the box at me and ran away! I found a great pair of boots and I am very happy with the experience. I think overall I always am when I got to Nordstrom, its just not my everyday shopping destination, its usually more for shoes, bags that type of thing.",positive
"For all things luxury, Nordstrom's is the place to shop! I was looking for a kate spade iPhone case & saw online that Nordstrom's was having a huge ""fashion brands anniversary sale."" And thankfully everything was marked off to like 50% off. Nordstrom's is gorgeous inside, neatly organized & clean. Salespeople are extremely friendly & not pushy. I really like that! Naturally, regular prices here are expensive, but if you have ""that kind of money"", then by all means, spend away! Like every other major retailer, they have sales quite frequently, so maybe that item you're spying will go on sale soon enough.",positive
"Jenny, Manager on Duty at the Nordstrom Southpark store displayed exemplary customer service on Saturday July 6,2012. I will always shop at Nordstrom due to the customer service. It is over the top!!!!!",positive
"I love shopping! And this store makes it a lot more fun! They have a huge variety of items and some of the most helpful and friendly associates I've ever been around. It's like they pride themselves on having superior customer service. No matter the department, everyone is willing to help you find whatever you need. Great shopping experience! I will be back!",positive
"Customer service! Someone still has it this day in age! After waiting for several minutes for someone to help me over at Dillard's, I simply gave up, walked into Nordstrom, and purchased the same pair of shoes in no time flat! To the employee who helped me: Hats off to you good sir!",positive
It is the absolute best shopping experience available. Wouldn't it be great if all retailers aspired to this level of customer service!!!!,positive
"Nordstroms offers such an elevated shopping experience that it's a wonder we even bother with the other department stores in South Park Mall. Regardless of what you're looking, they have exactly what you need for that specific event. The salespeople are super helpful and have a great eye for finding your style. And despite the high-level offerings, it's not as outlandishly expensive as your Needless Markup comparison; they also offer semi-annual sales, and their website offers great markdowns. But the thing I absolutely love the most is their return policy. Order online and return to the store, return something far past other stores' 90 day cutoff, whatever, and they'll take it back, no questions asked. How far does that go? I just returned a pair of shoes that I bought 4 years ago and had never worn - 5 minutes later, I had my return receipt and the dollars were credited to my card. I can't think of another store that offers that level of customer service. Thank you for going above and beyond, Nordstroms!",positive
"I've wandered the isles of Nordstrom many a time and besides the shoe selection - it's eh. If I want some shoes, I'm going straight here. But if I'm looking for a cute dress or blouse, I'll go here dead last. Of the many, many times I've been to Nordstrom I have never once been helped, which has ultimately stopped me from buying anything time after time. I've found a few items I've considered and then realized I don't love them, I just want to buy them because I can't figure out why I've never bought anything here (except shoes) when this is my type of place. On my last trip I realized, I've never bought anything at Nordstrom because of the lack of service. I wander around hopelessly looking for something very specific, and wanting to drop some serious cash, and not a single sales shark even sniffs in my direction. Immediately, I'm turned off. I'll go to Marshall's where I expect bad service and the things I would have bought at Nordstrom are half price.",negative
"Can I get Trina Turk online for cheaper? Can I get Bobbi Brown online, tax free? Can I scour eBay and buy 2 pairs of slightly used Jimmy Choos for the price of one at Nordie's? ABSOLUTELY. But when I do shop retail, this is my poison of choice. Nordstrom's philosophy is to provide great customer service. I should say it's OUSTANDING, either at the retail store, or RACK location. TIP: Make friends with your sales associate if you click with him/her. It's INVALUABLE. When you get a good one, he or she will cater to your every need and give you the heads up on upcoming sales. For example, at the Nordstrom in Kansas, my SA not only called me when a jacket or pair of jeans I had been eying was about to go on sale-- she would private shop with me, and pull items in my size she thought I'd like so the shopping experience would take less time, and be more efficient. Here at Southpark, one of the SA's, Kesh even TEXT MESSAGES me handbags she thinks I'd like, and gave me the heads up weeks in advance of what would be on sale. If you're trying on anything, the SA's are great about attending to you, calling in a tailor if alterations are necessary...you feel like a million bucks, even if you're buying a $25 t-shirt. I never feel pressured to buy anything (although there is a woman in lingerie who needs to work on the finesse...and a young man in the BP shoes department who blatantly targeted me in the designer handbags section where he knew nothing about the designer, to try and sell me a $1k bag. Not classy, but I'll chalk it up to inexperience and arrogance.) so there's rarely any buyer's remorse. The return policy is also beyond anything I've ever experienced. I once bought a white belt I thought would go with a blue dress, and when I got home, it didn't go well at all. One YEAR later, I felt guilty, and didn't want to seem like I was abusing the policy, but I was able to return the belt, no questions asked. There is a book called Retail Hell, a first-hand account of being a SA at Nordstrom, where people would try and return handbags that were clearly scuffed and used... and one woman had an open tampon inside the bag...and still was able to return it! This I do NOT approve of, and wish the return policy wouldn't be abused like this. Oh, and charge sends. If you don't see something in store you've seen online, the SA's will search the entire Nordie's national network and locate the item for you and have it shipped right to your door. This is beyond helpful and has saved me multiple times. TIP: When you shop the annual Anniversary sale, where fall styles go on sale before they're in season, either go EARLY on a weekday, or shop late in the day. Ladies are like predators during this time, and will shop frantically for these deals. Don't be alarmed. If the size you want isn't there, get it charge sent. TIP 2: If you shop here a lot...getting a Nordstrom debit is a great value. (I hate store credit cards, since it's another bill to worry about. With debit, it just comes out of your bank account like a regular debit card.) You'll get points for every purchase, and Nordstrom Note GC's every so often...plus if you reach a certain level, free alterations (whoo hoo!) and beauty bonuses. (In the past 6 months I've gotten cards sent to me for free 3 piece mini mascaras, and 3 lipglosses from big beauty brands.) OK, I'm going to stop yammering now...but just in case my review didn't get my point across clearlyl...I love me some Nordstrom!",positive
"Ah, Nordstrom, both the light and the bane of my existence. You take all my money and leave me with fashionable clothes, shoes, accessories and cosmetics. This is my favorite department store in all of the land. Merchandise is quality and can be pricey, but the Nordstrom semi-annual and anniversary sales are paramount, people. With everything from designer jeans to athletic gear on deep discount, these are most definitely the times to go. Service is some of the best in the retail industry and their return policy is second to none. Me likey. This particular Nordstrom is well-placed in the high end wing of SouthPark mall. Parking is typically a snap - entering off of Fairview is my preferred parking deck and walk yourself right in to the second floor. One last little nugget of info for all you shoppers out there: if you see something online that you cannot purchase in store, order it FROM the store - shipping is free. Yes. Free. Walk yourself up to a retail counter and ask one of the nice ladies or gentlemen to place an online order for you. Done and done. I've even called this in before...save money on quality mech. Thanks, Nordies!",positive
"I am rarely a department store shopper by any stretch of the imagination, and now that I mention it, I am not much of a shopper of any kind. It has also been years since I have been to a Nordstrom. Probably since I lived in Seattle and their logo was the one of the all lowercase, computerized font. I think they dropped that in the early nineties (though I actually left Seattle long before that happened). So it has been a while. Regardless, this Nordstrom is actually quite nice. Even the logo. The staff is friendly and helpful, and even if you do not have your receipt, they are more than happy to take your return and make sure that you get something you like in exchange - generally at a slightly higher price, of course.",positive
"Nordstrom is high end yet within reach. Though it comes across as ritzy, there are plenty of sales and affordable items. The shoe department always has a great selection. The upstairs cafe and downstairs e-bar always have great food!",positive
"The cafe upstairs (on the Belk side of the store) has great food (and drinks). The customer service is terrific; I wanted to buy a pair of shoes on sale but my size was out of stock, a pair at home appeared via UPS, with no shipping cost, just a few days later. The clothes are great and pretty stylish. You'll be well-dressed, well-fed and made to feel good when you shop here. Unlike Neiman Marcus, you don't have to jump through hoops and be treated as if the store is doing you a favor to let you shop there.",positive
"Now 5 stars specifically for Blair at the Bobbi Brown counter - because she was just AWESOME! Super nice to both me and my friend and totally helped us out. Granted, she ended up making a huge sale, since my friend was specifically there to get some makeup from Bobbi Brown, but that's besides the point. Because we could have easily walked away if she got ugly. We didn't really peruse the rest of the store though, sorry. This is why I'm giving it a 4 instead of a 5, since the 5 would really only be for Blair, and not really for the whole store.",positive
"I'm from California and I was so happy to see that South Park had a Nordies!! I always catch their sales and find the cutest shoes there!! Mostly, I go for the makeup counters!! :) I always go to MAC, of course, but today I stopped by Bobbi Brown. I had to kill the rest of a giftcard (b/c it was burning a whole in my wallet) and I wanted to purchase some new makeup. And that's when I met Blair...I don't know her last name but she was PHENOMENAL!! All the folks at the Nordies makeup counters are always super friendly and never too invasive, but Blair was excellent!! She helped me remember what Bobbi cosmetics I had tried at another store and she was very helpful teaching me how to apply everything! She even gave me, and my friend, samples of some other products to try!! Please visit Nordies! the best time to shop is during their sales, but every now and then, they have makeup events where certain brands (like MAC or Bobbi Brown) send their artists in to help teach you how to use the products and whatnot (if you are into makeup)!! I also enjoy the pianists they have who play while you're shopping!!",positive
Great clothing store. I found everything I need. The customer service are great there. I shop there for every major event.,positive
Top of the line!!! Second to none! Quality materials. Exceptional customer service....Nyoni is always willing to above and beyond to satisfy his customers.,positive
Nyoni Couture is definitely the best kept secrets in the Southeast! World-class quality and exceptional modern styling that fits you impeccably! Truly bespoke!,positive
"I called Nyoni and shared with him that I wanted two suits for my husband for Christmas. Within two days the suits were delivered to my house. This was days before Christmas and Nyoni said to get back to him after my husband tries the suits. Well Christmas morning he did and LOVED THEM. My husband wanted another color than what I got and I called Nyoni AGAIN and of course he answered. He sent the other color right away even before I returned the original. He has top quality suits, the service is 10, he is response and looks to ensure his customer is completely satisfied. I am so impressed by the service and quality that I have requested a custom made tux because I've always wanted one. I will post a picture once he makes it for me. Ladies if you love your man in a suit, buy one of Nyoni's suits for him. You will LOVE how he looks. Men, do yourselves and favor and add one of these suits to your collection. Trust me!! Nyoni Couture THANK YOU for making my husband look even hotter. :)",positive
Nyoni is very professional and takes his time with each of his clients. Truly fashionable guy and will have you looking your best for every occasion. Go see him.,positive
"Top quality custom suits, personalized attention, and top notch customer service is why I rave about Nyoni Couture. I live in Maryland but after tons of research and referrals from friends and strangers alike, my husband and I had to come visit Nyoni Couture. We came and Nyoni was so patient with my husband, He practically dressed him and he loved it. The suits are tailored to perfection and my husband receives soo many compliments anytime he wears any of Nyoni's suits. From being wedding guests to business dinners, my husband stands out. Thanks Nyoni you will be our only stop for custom suits. Thanks so much!! People take my word, check this place out. You won't be disappointed.",positive
"I truly hope that if the manager of this store ever finds herself in a situation where she can avoid some unnecessary embarrassment by simply being able to access a restroom that someone will make an exception for her unlike she did for my young daughter today. It's a restroom and she is a small child that, yes, in the midst of being excited about a pair of new shoes waited a bit too long to say she needed a restroom but seriously, it's a public store you could have taken the opportunity to be helpful and do the right thing. Your logic that she couldn't use it cause then you would have to allow everyone else to use it as well was absurd .. the store was empty! Plus, in the time you took to explain the ridiculous reason she couldn't use it to me she could have been done and out of your hair and you might have felt good for helping a child who needed it.",negative
"We've been here a few times but I think that we made one purchase up to this point. It's a good size store, rectangle-shaped- it goes pretty deep. It's always clean. The regular selection of shoes are always well-stocked. I just noticed that this store also has handbags (blinders, shoes), located at the front and back. Immediate greetings upon entering. There were other customers shopping. Today the promotion was ""Buy one pair, get the second pair at 50% off."" I always go straight to the clearance section in the back, but I checked both size 6 and 6.5 to be sure (different brands are different sizes). I saw so many pairs of shoes and boots that I really liked- BOC, Bob's by Skechers, Crocs, Earth, Sofft, & many others. I had decided on two pairs when I learned that the promotion also applied to the clearance shoes. I was trying to focus on sandals that would offer support, something for work and vacation, but didn't look like ""old lady"" styles (Life is too short for cheap shoes that hurt your feet. - Me). I almost got seduced by the lowest-priced ones ($19.99 & $14.99), but I gotta go with which ones were the best and the ones I loved. I opted for two BOC pairs of sandals. (I can always go back for the boots, haha.) Checkout was pretty good. Nice clerk. Return policy is good. Must have receipt.",positive
"Shoe type for ALL occasions ALL ages. Prices are a little high, but better to buy two pair for the price of one. Was able to find dress shoes by one of my favorite designers Nina, casual slip ons from Steve Madden, and Vans sneakers. Help from Staff was available but unnecessary since the shoe sizes are made available on the racks. They also sell designer bags, socks, jewelry, shoe cleaning products, and hats! My new go to store for shoes!",positive
"After Trader Joes stepped out and right at the corner of my eye to the left I see ""Shoes""! Then LOL dragged my hubby in there and unfortunately what I was looking for is it of season. Next time and petty much like a famous footwear. Nice selections and ok!",negative
"I can sum up this store in one word: Selection. Of course, you're not going to find any Carrie Bradshaw worthy shoes here, but you can find a wide range of decently priced boots, sandals, wedges, heels and sneakers for nearly every occasion. That said, I find the store to be a bit hit-or-miss. I love that they generally have sales going on (Buy 1, Get 1 Half-Off, for example) but sometimes I have a hard time finding even one pair that I like, much less two. I usually head straight back to check out their sale section, and I have snagged a few good pairs from there. A pair of Steve Madden flats, some adorable cork and hemp strappy summer wedges and a pair of Bear Claw, fur-lined boots during the winter months. I don't think I've ever paid more than $30 a pair. It's a clean store with friendly sales associates and plenty of stock, they just might not have what you're looking for the day you happen to walk in but that doesn't mean that in a couple they still won't! My advice? Keep checking in. Eventually, you will find the perfect pair...of something!",positive
"I'm going to change the name of this store to: Yes, we have no 8 to 9's today! I guess in a way it is my fault. Who knew that the Asian tourists clobber this store so hard. Who knew that these sizes were the ones they wear? Who knew that it was kind of a joke to see all the 12's and 13's mocking me (And I didn't see one basketball player in the store)? As for the better styles, they have even less of a choice of sizes!",negative
"We went here about a week or so ago for the first time because we heard about their BOGO sale & the hubby wanted some new work out shoes. We walked in about 5 of us. My husband was trying on a pair of shoes when I noticed a sales associate standing behind us, maybe just a few feet away DEAD ON STARING. Her & another associate who kept walking by I'm assuming thought we were trying to steal shoes. First of all, I used to work retail & I know how it goes. Never have I ever disrespected customers like how we were disrespected. 1. We were not stealing, & 2. If you suspect a customer of stealing which you can be wrong like in our instance; you go up to them and act like you're helping them so that they know you're watching them instead of making innocent customers feel uncomfortable. This idiot employee was so unprofessional. We ended up purchasing 2 pairs of shoes & that was definitely our first and last time at this store.",negative
"Walked in tried on some boots. Was never greeted, never helped. Actually a sales associate walked right pass me to ask another lady if she needed help. After the woman said no, the sales associate again walked directly pass me, like right in my face. Idk I think the associates here are racially biased. The don't seem to be interested helping the minority customers. This experience put a bad taste in my mouth and I will not return.",negative
Walked in looking for 6 inch all black heels with an ankle strap. Wandered around the store for half an hour with no assistance offered. Walked out. Wasn't greeted at all although there were reps walking all around the store. Won't be returning.,negative
"I thought this was Saks related. No such luck. It's just a big shoe store with isles and isles of shoes... yet very few wides so nothing for me. The salesperson was helpful but didn't seem to know the stock that well. My standard question when faced with limited sizes is ""What brands run wide?"". No one seemed to know that.",negative
"Oh my.... Off Broadway may have stolen my heart... (I'm sorry for cheating on you, DSW). Conveniently located in Downtown Summerlin, I finally had a chance to mosey over there on my lunch break. Oh boy.. Shoe nirvana! I think DSW may have a bigger selection, but Off Broadway is having a sale on their boots, so my eyes lit up like a kid in a candy store. The standout about Off Broadway, however, was the customer service. Maybe it is because they weren't busy, or they are a new store, but the staff was SO helpful and kind. I was greeted when I walked in, they explained where things were, let me alone for awhile to browse, came to see if I needed any help, checked sizes in the system when I couldn't find something I wanted, explained the shipping options.. It was pretty darn remarkable. The boots I got were great (and on sale), and the clerk who rang me up was similarly friendly and polite. It's probably a bad thing that they are close to my job...Because like Arnold says, ""I'll be back!""",positive
"Be careful ordering ONLINE with this company. You may think you are ordering a certain color shoe as a photo may demonstrate. Only it may not be accurate. Unlike Amazon. Com, this company will not let you cancel the order shortly after the order is placed and you will be stuck with the shipping fee.",negative
"I have to admit when it comes to shoe stores, I am totally biased. Since I work for a major online shoe retailer, I feel like I am a huge cheater whenever I go to a brick and mortar shoe store! Every once in awhile I will venture in to see how a particular brand fits or looks, but I never buy. Off Broadway is fairly small and doesn't have much variety. The prices are high and even their clearance section wasn't a very good bargain. On the other hand, the staff was very friendly! If you don't like to buy your footwear online, I suppose it's just as good as any other brick & mortar shoe store out there. I feel guilty even reviewing another shoe retailer!",negative
"I discovered Off Broadway Shoes in L.A. and have visited it whenever I was there. I was thrilled to find them at Downtown Summerlin! But I'm still nursing my wounds over not finding the navy blue cowboy boot in my size a year ago in L.A., and they sure haven't made an appearance at this new outpost. They have a great selection of shoes and boots in all price ranges. I don't think it's as extensive as DSW, though. Still, it's wonderful to have a big shoe store closer to where I live. They have a fairly generous return policy, 60 days I think. And if you're a guy who wears a very small size shoe, they even have some au courant styles available. I didn't buy anything for myself on this visit, but did manage to find two pairs for my husband, who can NEVER find anything in his size. Not that he ever thinks he needs shoes, but I know better. Nice addition to Downtown Summerlin, across the parking lot from Trader Joe, which means I'll be checking their stock often.",positive
"Oh Old Navy, we have a serious love/hate relationship. I LOVE you because of your cute clothes and deals, but I hate the credit card bills, haha! I would say that I do about 50% of my shopping for both my husband and I here. And I know when we start having children, they'll be in the mix as well! If you're like me and frequent Old Navy, I HIGHLY suggest getting their credit card. You seriously save so much money! I love Old Navy for the basics - solid dresses, t-shirts, shorts, pants - you know, things that you can layer with a fun sweater or scarf. They're always following the trends, i.e. off the shoulder tops and dresses right now. I know that i'll see you soon, Old Navy! This store is always well stocked and friendly!",positive
The best customer service I have ever received at this location. They went out of their way to make sure I knew which jeans were on sale so I could be getting the deal I came into the store for. They also refunded my transaction because I decided to apply for the Old Navy credit card after I checked out to give me the discount for joining!,positive
"Geidi is incredibly rude. Was just in looking for my size in pants and bending down looking through the sizes. There was a rack of hanging jeans directly next to me. As she stood there talking loudly to another coworker about something not related to her job apparently she ran out of patience with me bending over looking. So instead of waiting to put back go back jeans, she squeezes in the tiny 2 foot space and smacks me in the head with jeans as she tried to smash them back into the rack. Like how rude are you? You couldn't wait 20 seconds for me to stand up and move so you just try to squeeze between me and another rack? Nice customer service you snot.",negative
Employees are super rude especially the tall Blonde hair chick. I walk in little past 9 and there is 20 people still in the store but she wants to yell at me that they are closed. Never go there again,negative
"Perhaps it's because it's a Thursday and it isn't very crowded, but this Old Navy is REALLY well maintained! Everything on the tables is folded and sorted...not typical of a clothing retailer these days. Added bonus: we were greeted several times throughout the store...not just when we entered. All-in-all, probably the best Old Navy I've been in...though, the true test would be to come during peak shopping time.",positive
"I am boycotting this Old Navy, and Old Navy in general after a recent visit to this store. I was shocked at their customer service or lack-there-of.",negative
"Decent selection, but the selling process is so so slow. No busy parents have time to wait hours to sell a few items. The staff are not good at giving a reasonable time estimate. The store is messy and the staff are not very professional. It kind of doesn't end up being worth it if you want to sell items. And some of the items for sale are over priced if you consider the prices you can get brand new items for if you shop sales.",negative
"Do not recommend simply because the staff is beyond rude. I dropped a bucket of clothes off at 1045 with the estimated wait time being an hour. I returned around 12:15 and my things still were not ready which was totally fine. However the woman at the front didn't even acknowledge o was standing there. She didn't even turn around to look at me. Finally she said ""last name"" still without having looked at me. I told her my name and she couldn't find my bin. I located it and she told me it would need about ten more min. I went back to my car and gave them a good 15 min before returning. When I did the same thing happened. No acknowledgement. I told her my last name again. The woman acted like she had never seen me although this was our third encounter in a matter of 2 1/2 hours. She then said ten more min and with explanation walked off. When I entered the final time they threw my bin on the floor and told me how much they could offer all the while being rude. The place smells horrible and the staff is so increasingly unpleasant.",negative
"Been here a few times and have found some good deals. However, every time I go the staff is incredibly unprofessional. Their first goal is definitely not customer service. Have consigned twice with them, and the second time when I returned to pick up the remainder of my clothes, I found they had given them to someone else. There were a couple of phone calls made but never resolved. And they never even cared for it to be resolved. Ok if you want to buy some clothes here, but NEVER consign here!",negative
"This shop is a great resource for all families. They have great deals and a lot of toys in excellent condition, as well as clothes. I bought most of my little one's pajamas at this store. PJs are something that can be so expensive new, the footie ones run about $3-4 here. As other reviewers stated, the clothes are organized by colors for some ungodly reason, so it will take some time to find the size you need. As others have mentioned, the customer service is not top notch here. Employees are often having inappropriate personal conversions on the sales floor. They haven't necessarily been rude to me, but not friendly or extremely helpful. One day I purchased a pair of shoes for my son at the store. When I purchased them, the elastic was broken, I returned them without a problem. The next time I went in I spotted the broken shoes back in the shoe bucket. So, that's what kind of service professionals you're dealing with here. One final piece of advice, check the Amazon price on toys before you leave the store. There was one instance that I saw a bouncy chair for sale in the store and it was the same price with free shipping on Amazon.",negative
"I've been here quite a few times and never had a problem here, though I don't go for the customer service- it's not Nordstrom's. I will agree they don't offer much for clothing and other various items you might be selling them but then again they need to sell it as well. Heck, I bought a like new Bumbo seat for $10 and a play bouncer for $35. Go ahead and spend $40 for your Bumbo and $180 for your play bouncer....seriously. The older kids clothes- like 3 and up- aren't terribly great but I've found a few things, especially shoes, at good prices. And I've been to that shop in the park road shopping center- can you say full price? No, my child doesn't wear Ralph Lauren- so if you want that go pay full price somewhere else. They have good finds, but just like the Goodwill, you're not going to find the same thing each time. Oh, I'd also like to ad I bought a like new pack n play there for $30. You can't beat that- really.",positive
After visiting Once upon a child 2 years ago and having horrible service I decided to give it another try. I had some great stuff to sell and needed winter things for my children. I walked in 5 girls stood behind the counter not one offered to help. When I finally spoke the girl that came to help let me know she didn't want to. I nearly had to beg for a pen. She told me it would be 30 minutes. I shopped around literally bumping into the workers who were chatting all over the store. The same girl asked me more than 10 times in the almost 2 hrs I waited if I wanted to checkout. I explained 3 times I was still waiting and several people had came after me and now left. The girl resonded they were really busy. Ummm...you are talking and one out of 5 is going through the buy bins and she stops to talk to everyone of the other workers every 2 minutes. They were SLOW and rude and constantly wispered and gave nasty looks. When they paid for my stuff the girl pretty much threw my money down. I laid everything I was going to buy down. I will never return!,negative
"No matter how often I'm there, the staff is horribly rude - not just to me but to every customer. If I ever find another place to take children's items, I will not return. There is no excuse for the ugly attitude and behavior to everyone.",negative
"Nothing overly nice, about the same as a yard sale, but pricier. They only give you a third of what they plan to sell it for. So don't plan on making any money selling to them. Staff is rude & snotty with ""comments"". While my sister has had very good luck with the store in her state, the Pineville and Matthews locations, I would not go into again. Especially Pineville. They have always have an excuse why they can't ""accept"" something. I swear I think they read off a list under the counter. Why are they in business? Maybe they don't want to buy top end stuff and would rather have a junky store. Try some of the other locations in Charlotte before this one.",negative
"Being someone who has a little toddler sister and a mother who loves buying new clothes for her I was super excited when I learned about stores like Once Upon A Child or KidtoKid; who take gently used baby clothes and give you cash! From the beginning my mother told me not to expect a lot of money from these stores. That I'd be lucky if I made 20 dollars even with a bag full of nice clothes. So on my first trip to KidtoKid on Park Road I didn't expect much. I was aiming for maybe $15 dollars. I brought a shopping bag worth of stuff that I had washed, dried and even ironed the night before. But on my first trip to KidtoKid I made $22 dollars! I was so excited I decided to keep doing this every couple of months when my sister would grow out of her clothes. My next trip to KidtoKid I made $20 dollars. And on my third trip I made $15. A couple of months later I decided to give Once Upon A Child a try. I had read on other websites that they are horrible and have rude employees and don't give you crap for your clothes. But like I said before I don't have very high expectations when I try to sell my used baby clothes or baby equipment. So I decided to make a trip to Once Upon A Child one afternoon with huge bag worth of baby clothes. I arrived at Once Upon A Child at around 12:00PM. I immediately noticed that the store is dark and dated. When I finally got the attention of one of the ladies in the front they told me how it works and everything and said my clothes would be reviewed and done by 1:30PM. I've never had to wait longer than 45 minutes at KidtoKid, but I decided to waste time at Carolina Place Mall. I got back to Once Upon A Child around 1:45PM to figure out that my clothes still hadn't even been reviewed yet. They weren't even in the process of reviewing my clothes. So I ended up walking around the store for another 45 minutes! That didn't even bother me to much until I got to the front and the lady told me they only took one of my items. That the clothes were adorable but they were a tad bit wrinkled so to throw them in the dryer again and then bring them back. She literally had the nerve of taking one of my clothing items and gave me $2.15! Like I said before I never have high expectations when I try to sell these clothes but two dollars and fifteen cents is INSULTING. There should be a minimum amount that they give you of at least $5.00. So I could of at least walked out of that freakin' store with enough to buy a frappuccino. It was an awful experience. The ladies weren't rude but they weren't that friendly either. And that I had to wait that long amount of time weren't friendly either. And to literally take one of my clothing items and give me two dollars was terrible. I wasted my gas and my time. I'm going to keep giving my business to KidtoKid on Park Road. The girls that work there are usually friendly. The store is pretty and has WAY WAY better clothes then Once Upon A Child. And I've never had to wait longer than 45 minutes. Don't sell your clothes at Once Upon A Child, go to KidtoKid!",negative
"One of 2 locations in the Charlotte area if you're looking for inexpensive slightly used kids clothing, toys, shoes, strollers, or pretty much anything baby....this is your place! They also purchase your used baby equipment, clothes, etc if it's in good condition. Check them out, sometimes you can find pretty good steals if your timing is right.",negative
"I bought a bike from Oxygen Bike company two years ago (great experience dealing with Chris, the manager). I recently had a fall after dodging someone who fell off their skateboard. My bike handle bent inwards. I brought it in to see if it could be fixed. Jeremy fixed it right up (handle bar wasn't broken), and checked to make sure everything else was running fine. Great chatting with Jeremy and Jacob (nice to see Chris there too). Great people working here. P.S. Shawn was also great over e-mail exchanges.",positive
"I honestly don't know what I would do without this awesome local bike shop, I have been in there at least 10 times this Winter alone to get both of my bicycles serviced. Winter biking is rough on all the bike parts but it is so incredibly rewarding and fun. Thanks to Oxygen's staff, no type of weather stops me from getting onto my bicycle and loving it.",positive
"Excellent service and nothing better than free tune ups for life. I came here around February to purchase a road bike as I wanted to get into road cycling for exercise. Chris helped me out and was extremely knowledgable in picking out a bike that fit my needs and my budget. He also took the time and patience to explain things to me (as I was completely new to road bikes) and answer all my questions. We probably spent over an hour going through different bikes and adjusting it to my needs. I really appreciated that help. Since then I've dropped by the shop to pick up some additional gear and once to ask about an issue I was with the bike. They showed me what the problem was, what caused it, and fixed it immediately. Their service is what keeps me coming back. As mentioned above, when you buy a bike from the shop you get free tune ups for the life of the bike - which is obviously a great bonus. If you at all feel intimidated about the bike culture, don't be. Just visit Oxygen and they'll guide you through everything and eventually you'll be riding away extremely pleased with your decision.",positive
"In September of 2014, at a blowout sale on CNE grounds I bought my first bike I had purchased in 14 years. I remember meeting one of the guys from Oxygen there. He was extremely professional, friendly, approachable and knowledgeable. My three interactions I've had with all the folks at Oxygen have been positive. They give me free tune ups for life with the purchase of the bike. In the spring of 2015 they fixed a cable on my bike for free, and today (sept 2015) I had an informative feedback interaction with one of the mechanics while dropping my bike off for the yearly tune up. Good guys, with good knowledge in a small shop, but worth the time checking them out and doing business with them. They're just too far away from where I live :)",positive
"A friend gave me a folding bike that he hadn't used in a very long time. I went to Oxygen Bike Co. because it was local and the yelp reviews were good. I came in expecting that the bike needed a complete tune up. Chris pumped up the tires, tested it out and assured me it was in fine condition. He made adjustments on the bike so that it would fit me. It's been years since I've been on a bike. Chris was fantastic in helping select a new lock, helmet and even installed my new water bottle cage on the spot. I noticed that staff helping other customers while I was there were also friendly. Glad this is my local bike shop. Great customer service.",positive
My wife and I just got a child seat for the front of my bike. These guys were awesome! They explained the different options to me and focused especially on safety (which I appreciate as a father). Great customer service! We'll be back!,positive
"This place is really great! I finally came for a tune up (haven't had one since I purchased my bike). They were right on time in terms of estimating when it would be done. I would've preferred it to be a bit sooner, but it's a lifetime of tune ups if you purchase your bike at their shop. Lifetime of tune ups! How amazing is that? I'm sure they have plenty of bikes in the queue no matter what. Friendly bunch of guys who work here.",positive
My husband bought a good quality used bike here and was very happy with his experience. I thought the customer service was the friendliest I've seen in a bike shop. Items looked reasonably priced too.,positive
"It's a nice new shop and I met the owner who was friendly. The service level was pretty low however. I called and asked if they had pedals and shoes in my size and was assured that unless I was a size 15, the had me covered. Also that it would only take 15 minutes to install and I would be on my way. Delighted, I arrived at the shop 15 mins later to discover they didn't have anything close to my size (8,9,10) or even equivalent in women's sizes. The friendly shop keep and owner (Shawn/Sean) explained that they will order and have my size the next two businesses days and would phone me - a week later no call so I phoned - spoke to the owner once again who didn't remember anything and said shoes wouldn't be coming in for another week *maybe*. Oh well, guess they are still working on the kinks and customer service.",negative
"Sorry to say this location is closed. Despite their Facebook, website, etc. I went yesterday (closed) and today (still closed). I called the North Las Vegas shop and was called a liar by the idiot working there. He said there was a clear sign in the window. Noooooo.....if there was, I wouldn't have returned to find it closed again! Bye, Pharmacy.",negative
"5 stars. This skate shop has some of the friendliest, knowledgeable, no-ego guys around. My daughter loves skateboarding and each time we go here they are super cool to her, talk to her about what she's looking for, always helping her find just the right equipment, deck size, etc. She went for their Prez Day sale a couple weeks ago and they were sold out of the regular Pharmacy boards so they gave her a better board at the sale price. I went today to surprise my daughter with new wheels, trucks, bearings, etc., for a deck she'd bought there a couple months ago. The guy working (whose name I spaced now) was super friendly, helpful and accommodating. He pulled out a couple different colored wheels to see which would look better, found some new, standard trucks they'd just gotten in to save me a few dollars, and helped my pick out a new pink ProTec skate helmet for her. He offered ideas of skate parks we might not know about and a place across town that does skate camps. He also threw in a handful of skate stickers for her board, which I know she'll be super stoked about. I was pretty impressed by his affable demeanor and willingness to answer all my 146,684 (give or take) questions. Would def recommend Pharmacy Skateboard Shop and I'm sure will be returning again sooner than later if my daughter has anything to do with it.",positive
"I'm sponsoring a needy local child for Christmas who asked for a skateboard. I have no experience skateboarding, so I wasn't sure what to expect when I went to Pharmacy. I explained my situation to Bernard, who proceeded to find exactly what I needed. Bernard was very helpful, friendly, and efficient. Good listener and problem solver -- model employee! Walked out with a skateboard ideal for my child's age and experience (beginner), as well as safety equipment. Thanks Pharmacy -- you are going to make a kid very happy this Christmas!",positive
"They seem nice but after purchasing a set of skate bearings, I try to return them and find out they don't take returns.they have lost my future business.",negative
"They made me an awesome complete. Great customer service and very informative about trucks, wheels, and bearings. The pharmacy board shop is great for skaters and for new skaters. Definitely coming back.",positive
Foreman was awesome. Very helpful to put together boards for my 2 kids. Well definitely come back again and highly recommended.,positive
"This place is awesome, and always helpful! Great place to go for skaters and safe to send people here for gifts if you are a skater. You'll love whatever youll get and theres always people there to answer your question or do whatever they can to. Faithful pharmacy shopper!(:",positive
The guy was very helpful and friendly. It was our sons first real board and he made it fun for him. The ten percent off for checking in helped a lot. I forgot how expensive these things are!,positive
Bernard(the boardrista) was super helpful and was happy to answer all of my questions with no hesitation. The shop itself was well equip and inviting with great deals and prices. The shop was busy but all of my needs were met. Great place and people.,positive
"Great board deals, but the staff is super all over the place. I walked in behind a family, the older kid was getting a board, the mom was paying for it and the little brother was swinging his whatever toy around. One cashier was helping the kid get his board while the other guy behind the counter, Bernard with the curly long hair, just stood there folding shirts and wouldn't acknowledge me at all, he just kept folding shirts and looking past me and over my head and past me again and then he even proceeded to ask somebody else who came in after me if he needed to open the sunglasses case for them...I kept looking at him hoping he would ask if I needed help, but he kept ignoring me, and it felt super intentional...I know he knew that I needed help because after the mom finished paying she saw that I was waiting and kindly moved over so I could be helped, but unfortunately her son was still talking to the cashier (about Dunkin donuts no less) so I walked up to the counter hoping to be helped by Bernard, but he still continued to look past me as if I wasn't even there. In fact he never looked at me at all and I had to wait while they all chit-chatted with the family ahead of me (since they all apparently know each other). At this point I was really beginning to feel uncomfortable because I knew I was being ignored. It gets even better though! Some kid who was skating came in and started showing the Bernard guy some tricks that he'd just filmed and if you couldn't guess, he continued to ignore me as I stood at the counter in his face. All I needed was a size 8 board and some grip, two minutes tops is what it would've taken to help me and I'm not one walk into a store and demand to be helped and waited on, but I do expect to be acknowledged...especially when I'm standing directly across the counter from you. I know I could've simply asked for help, but I felt so unwelcome that I didn't feel comfortable enough to. I ended up leaving with the worst board shop experience ever. It was an easy going and laid back atmosphere, but at the same time not really because it just felt super snobby. It's like, how are you gonna be too stuck up to help the only other person in line (especially when you guys are all just chatting away...that's just rude and unprofessional) and let alone not even greet or acknowledge other customers? It just makes me wanna take my business back to zumies. Everyone says support local, support small shops, but whenever I go to smaller local shops like this I'm all but ignored by the employees who act just as stuck up as the girls at pacsun and Abercrombie and Fitch aka they act like they're above you and too good to help you, whereas at zumies they're actually genuinely nice to you and they actually want to help you find what you need. The blond guy who rang me up was really nice and helpful, but that was the only good experience I had there today. I shouldn't have to wait forever to be acknowledged or helped. Please just let your employees know that a little kindness and just even greeting a customer goes such a long way...as does ignoring them. Even if they're not yet trained to work a register or ring someone up, they could at least acknowledge customers and ask them if they need any help. It's retail for crying out loud! Nobody wants to walk into your shop at the end of a long and stressful workday just to be ignored and treated like an inconvenience. Customers are more important to your business than shirts that need folding. You get 1 star because of your monthly deal on boards, but I'm still not sure if I'll be back as it's hard to keep shopping at an establishment where you're treated so horribly.",negative
The employee Bernard was super helpful answering all my very basic beginner questions. I felt welcome & was grateful for his very patient manner. I learned a lot about what style of skateboard i prefer.,positive
Just came in here to build a deck that I had lying around for a while. Both times I have been the staff have been super friendly and helpful. It's also nice to be able to visit a local shop that knows what they're talking about it instead of one of the big mall brands.,positive
"Love the pharmacy. It's a small shop so all product lines soft- and hardgoods are tightly selected. These guys don't sell products they wouldn't use themselves. Long on competence, knowledge, friendliness. Reasonable prices. My vote for best board shop in the valley.",positive
"Support Local Business! Now that I've said that, Support Local Business! I almost always try to shop for clothes at local places like this, yes I'm still 14-years-old. Pharmacy Boardshop has a decent selection of name brand shirts, hoodies, and shoes. They also sell their own brand of t-shirts called, ""Pharmacy"" and by the way, the shirts are super soft. Like any good skate shop, they have a large selection of skateboards; everything from short decks, long boards, and even a few 80's style pool carving boards which have been making a come back lately. I know some people can get intimated when walking into places like this, but the guys in here are very friendly and eager to help out newbies to the skate community. This place might be a little more pricey than Wally-World or other large box stores, but isn't it nice to know you're not feeding the beast?",positive
"Initially came here for the the Girl/Chocolate ""Pretty Sweet"" Tour Signing. Realized the location wasn't that bad, I came back to shop for the first time. I returned to take advantage of their $20 board deal (every 20th of the month!). Was immediately greeted when I came into the shop. Explained what I was looking for, and they hooked it up right away. They also pointed out other sales, including the area for buy one get one free shoes. Crazy good selection, staff is cool, and the prices are great!",positive
I've been going to pharmacy for over a decade and I LOVE this shop. By far the best variety of skate hardgoods and shoes in las vegas. I wouldn't go anywhere else for all of my skate/apperal needs. Very knowledgeable customer service too.,positive
"I have to say for a board shop I was given some great customer service. We were instantly greeted when we walked into the store. Just for checking in we got a 10% coupon. My boys knew what they wanted already which is abnormal for them. We had already been to the store a few days prior anyway, the kids picked their stuff, there was so much to choose from. They are competitive price wise as well as assortment wise. If my boys need any Diamond, Huff or Hundreds brand accessories, clothes, socks etc I know where I am going to bring them. The hours work with our schedule and the location is prime. The parking lot is a little small but there is always a parking spot. Thanks for always having everything we need in your little location. My boys can't wait to go back again!!",positive
"The place is located in the huge Walmart& sams club plaza, directly in front of walmart. Pretty easy to find. And its a huge place so parking is never really hard to find. Came to this place planning to buy some janoskis (shoes), Right when I walked in, someone greeted me and asked me if I needed any help. Good start. I ended up finding two pairs in the sale section, one of the workers was really surprised I found a certain pair. I wanted to buy the shoes cash so I said I'll be back. Came back 15 minutes later only to find the worker saying I couldn't buy one of the shoes anymore. Wtf? Apparently one of the shoes wasn't suppose to be on sale? It felt super shady and messed up. I couldn't tell if that was really the reason, or he just wanted to buy if for himself. Really bad first impression, don't get me wrong the place has really good merchandise but it was just really really shady on how I couldn't buy the shoes. When 15 minutes earlier I could have bought the shoes without any hassle. I ended up going to suite160 and buying another pair of shoes there. Really harsh review but its what it deserves for my visit. This place has some cool things though, I'll be sure to visit again and update.",negative
"What a cool shop with friendly workers. My boyfriend was looking for some shoes before he left town and we pulled up to the store at 8:01. They close at 8:00, but they didn't care and were so nice to let us in and peruse their shop after closing. There is very little women's selection here--just a few pairs of TOMS--but if you have a sk8terboi in your life and need a good gift, here is a relatively small business option. (I say relative because it is, indeed, a franchise, but only has two or three other locations, vs. Pac Sun or Tilly's or whatever that have thousands.) Recommended!",positive
Awesome place! Whenever we walk into Pharmacy we are greeted and told of what's new and what's on sale. The workers are so friendly every single time we come in. Other places sell the same brands but don't offer service unless you look like a millionaire. It's great to go to a shop in Vegas where the staff is humble and not so money hungry. Definitely a store to check out!,positive
"As far as small local skate shops go, Pharmacy is really all we have. They have some cool stuff on the discount rack all the time, but some of their stuff is pricy like the hoodies, shoes, and some jackets. They have a great deal on their blank decks though...every month on the 20th...the blanks are 20.00 bucks, you can't beat that. I like the service also. Donnie always takes care of me, but he works at the one off Eastern. He knows the gear, culture, and on my birthday he hooked me up with a shirt. I always buy stuff from them.",positive
"Relatively new to Las Vegas, not new to the rest of the west coast, The Pharmacy has a wide variety of sporting brands, my favorite being RVCA because they suppport young, up and coming artists. They also have a pretty good flux of apparel and goods going on sale. Its a cool little shop where you just wanna go and shoot the shit with the employees, who are all skaters themselves, all day long. * off the strip, non-casino",negative
"Worst store ever! Super rude costumer service. Will never go back there. Lady at the counter, think it was the owner was very rude. Asked her if she could help me in finding a size 2 in a style. After rolling her eyes and aggressively grabbing some keys, said yes, let me check. Total attitude. after that, I just left.",negative
"Holy cow! Why has it taken us a year to discover this place? If it hadn't been for the rain today, my husband and I may never had set foot into this shop--- it would have been our loss! Men's and women's clothing that you won't find in the chain stores, some fabulous accessory lines, and the cutest onesies I've ever seen! If you are looking for something to wear that won't be on every other person in tour office, this is THE PLACE to go. Price point vary, which is another thing we loved. She has several lines of the most adorable dresses I've seen in a long time. I can't wait to go back!",positive
"The simple sign and tucked away location has kept this place a secret from me. While strolling around Town Square, without any place in mind, I came across this shop. I thought my love of frills was excessive, but this shop puts my wildest imaginations to shame. Some shirts looked like they grabbed a hot glue gun and went crazy with rhinestones. Avoiding the sparkles for men, they had plenty more simple, yet special designs. The prices are steep, but they are no more than full price Banana Republic or Express. Also you are guaranteed that you will not see everyone running around in the same or similar looking items. They also carry an even amount of sizes that spans the spectrum. Sometimes, boutiques lean more towards the model demographic, but there were a good supply of S to XXL.",positive
"More of this please. Vegas has few independent boutiques for finding a unique accessory, charming gift or special little t-shirt, but you can find all three and more here! I stumbled across this shopping find while wandering around Town Square. It is a bit out of the way (next to Pete's Piano Bar), but just a glance out of the corner of my eye was all it took for me to want to take a closer look. They were featuring some creative, colorful tees designed by a LA artist. There were a couple Vegas-themed ones that I had to see up close. In addition to having some cute clothing pieces, there are a slew of trinkets, doo dads, and other fab delights, just the things you would love to give your best pal (or keep for yourself!) I even spied some one-of-a-kind watches. There is a men's section too. The vibe is a little bit street culture with a dash of feminine sass. Definitely the type of indie spot I would love to see more of!",positive
"I have stumbled upon greatness in this boutique that belongs on Melrose or on the Moon instead of Town Square. I am hooked! The clothes are stylish and reasonably priced considering they are so fashion forward and so well made. Phenom has something to make everyone look good. Hats from LA., T-shirts with funny slogans and beautiful women on them jeans button down tops going out clothes jewelry belts bags scarfs colorful watches And a million other things I can't remember. Oh, my favorite is a little change purse made out of a freakin cassette tape! How cool is that? I want everything in this damn store! When my friend and I lose thirty pounds I promised both of us fatties a shopping spree here. Vegas Yelpers, this store is where it's at so if you want to dress to impress or just want to look good get your arse down to Phenom before I buy the whole place!",positive
"What a fun store! It's so nice to find something unique after all these chains. The merchandise fits really well, and I'm betting that I won't see these clothes on anyone else around here. This is a great place to shop...",positive
"Pink Buffalo you are adorable. This is a little boutique in the shopping center where Holley's Cuppa is. It's right on Cimarron and Blue Diamond behind the bank hiding. After grabbing some fro yo at Poppy's I came in to check out their clothes since I had seen good reviews on yelp. I wasn't disappointed. This shop has some really cute items. They have dresses, tops, skirts, shorts, jewelry, and some purses as well. They have about 10 rack of clothes divided by color and they even have a rack for plus size. My only issue is they are so tiny so they only have a few of each item. It's hard to find something in an extra large. I've gonna back since and tried on some dresses with my friend. She was looking for a dress for the wedding and couldn't find her size. The lady was trying so hard to help us. She probably grabbed every dress in the place for us but still not luck. Why not 5 stars? Well, the weirdest thing was another lady just chilling in the corner with her shoes off. She wasn't very inviting. Also I still haven't bought anything. I'm gonna keep trying.",positive
"Great neighborhood botique that has super cute clothing and accessories at affordable prices! I bought a super cute little cami and wallet when I was in last that I get compliments on all the time. Good variety of clothes and sizes, the shop is nicely decorated, easy to shop in and items easy to find. Definitely will be back, loved it all!!",positive
Cute little neighborhood boutique.. So glad to have a store like this in mts edge.. Lots of trendy & affordable pieces w/ a wide variety of sizes. The store itself is decorated so cute!! & the owner is really nice.. Even gave me a discount coupon I can use the next time i come back. Support small local businesses!!! :),positive
Walked in and couldn't even get a hello. The lady behind the counter was to busy on her iPad to notice me. Walked around the store for a minute and then left. Wouldn't buy anything from her if I did see something I liked. She ruined it.,negative
Sooooooo excited to have this shop so close to home ! They offer a wide variety of sizes which I know a lot of other Vegas boutique don't ! So many cute things to choose from .....I found a comfy beach dress ....and a dress to wear to the club ....variety ! And lots of accessories !!!,positive
"Super cute shop! A must go for those in need of cute clothes and accessories who are trying to shop local. The prices are very affordable. The tops I got were around $20 and the cute ring was $7. Interestingly enough, they really do have something for everyone. My 62 year old other got some cute stuff along with my friend's 9 year old daughter. They even have plus sizes. Cute items for all!",positive
"Went to pink buffalo for the opening and loved what I found!! Such a cute store with so much to choose from! So many different sizes, I'm a bigger girl so selection sometimes is minimal for me.

"***ATTENTION PEOPLE WHO ARE OWED MONEY*** Please file a consumer complaint to the attorney general at azag.gov, it only took few minutes to complete.

phone seems dead and website is down? is store in phoenix closed? WHERE IS MY MONEY? It's been 10 months since you guys closed down the LA shop.,negative
This store has sold shoe that my husband put on consignment. After multiple phone calls and visit they have not paid him. They don't answer your calls and when you attempt to go instore to pick up money there is none! Crooks,negative
"If I could leave 0 stars I would, this place is a scam. Have had shoes sold on consignment for over 8 months and that have yet to pay me. Owner has given me the run around and even gave me a fake tracking number. Do not do business with. If anyone is interested in filing a class action or has information regarding a local lawyer please contact me.",negative
"If I could give them 0 stars I would. Brendan and this entire business operation are complete scam artists. They owe me over $1,000 for shoes that I've sold on consignment with them and it's been over a year and still no payment. Their checks bounce and the entire Pound 4 Pound business is a joke. At this point, unless other sellers want to band together and sue or take some necessary collective legal action against this place I'm giving up receiving any kind of payment for my shoes. I've been robbed!!!",negative
"DO NOT DO BUSINESS WITH P4P. They have never paid hundreds of dollars owed for two pairs of shoes they sold for me on consignment. I have been trying to get payment for more than 8 months, but they have offered nothing more than false promises and empty excuses. I am in the process of filing a complaint with AZ Attorney General consumer protection bureau.",negative
"Worst sneaker consignment ever!! Beware of this store! They will not pay you for your shoes when they sell, and their checks bounce. I had to argue with them a lot and force them to finally pay after months. They gave me a really hard time. This place is a scam! TERRIBLE!!!!",negative
The store owner Brendan Naper is a notorious scammer. He owes over $50k in debts to his own customers. Degenerate gambler who will steal your money. Avoid this fraudulent shop at all costs,negative
"AVOID AT ALL COSTS. Owner took my shoe from consignment and traded it with someone without telling me and now I cannot get my shoe back. They also owe me thousands of dollars for almost a year now, wont answer phone or anything.",negative
"They owe me $300 and I've been waiting for like 7 months. I've been calling them and even spoke to Brendan (the owner). Apparently, he has no control whatsoever over the checks and how long they take to get sent so if you want to deal with professionals that have control over these matters then don't shop here... seriously. I'm not the only person that's had this experience. Look at the other reviews to see for yourself.",negative

"Went to the one in Phoenix it was a really cool, I walked in looked around for a bit then just copped some 11's and left. The employees where really chill I asked for a good place to eat at, and the food was overall this store was amazing. I just wish they had more sizes in more shoes",positive
"I brought in a pair of Playoff 9's a couple weeks before the release in November, not only did I never receive a call when they sold in November but it's been almost 4 months and I still haven't received a check. Stick with Flight Club or your local Sneaker Facebook pages if you actually want to get paid, this place is a joke",negative
"It doesn't matter who is working, whether its the owner or one of the employees, the service is always great. I've consigned here before and the process was smooth, they also offer to buy your sneakers depending on what exactly you are looking to sell! Will definetly be back, whether I need to sell or buy!",positive
"I was in town visiting family so i wanted to make sure i checked it this spot out while I was near. I heard about Pound for Pound Shoes online in a few of my sneakers groups and heard nothing but good things. I stopped by early afternoon and was greeted as soon as walked in the store. I met Brendan the owner, he was a super nice dude and very knowledgable of shoes. Overall I spent a little over an hour and left the store with 4 pairs of kicks at a very reasonable price. I have and will refer friends here. I found out they have a location in LA and am traveling there in very soon and am going to have to plan to make a stop to see what else I can pick for my shoe collection. Keep up the good work guys, till next time.",positive
"*REVIEW FOR ONLINE STORE ONLY* This was my first actual purchase of Jordan's and I was very skeptical not only ordering online but about the authenticity as well. We all know that some people online will price rape you for the popular Jordans and I was definitely not interested in paying over $500 so seeing that I found my shoes for a decent value, I was impressed. I was not sure as to what size I would be because I am a true 8.5 in women's sneakers so I emailed the store and they responsed promptly and gave me assurance that they guarantee their products. They also were clear and correct about what size would be best for me. I went ahead and ordered my low concords and they arrived today with 2 day shipping in immaculate condition. I will continue to purchase again. Thank you Pound for Pound.",positive
"I have sold a couple of shoes on consignment with pound for pound without a hitch. So I decided to bring in a bit mor following trip to the store as it is far from avondale. So I brought in 6 pairs they sold 2 which I went to pick up my check for I call 2 weeks later none of the others sold per Brandon. A week later I called and 2 more pairs sold and over the phone Brandon clearly stated you can come in and pickup your check for both pairs. I get there and he tells me they paid me out for one of the other pairs and so he can only pay me for one of the shoes. This is a bold face lie I never received payment for one of the pairs. Me working at a bank know the procedures about how to get this looked at quickly. Instead he says my cpa will review my activity and I will call you in a week when I know for sure we did or didn't pay you. It's as simple as logging into online banking and if you paid the check amount and my name should be on the check with 20% deducted very simple math. He gets offended and says I'll let you know in a week that's all j can do. So because of his short comings as an owner, manager and business man I'm left to wonder about my shoes and money. Solely because they don't have a good system in place. I advise all shoe lovers beware they are not equipped to handle business and definitely not my shoes anymore. Needless to say I will never trust Brandon or pound for pound with my sneaks again.",negative
"The best AZ has to offer when it comes to sneakers. Weather new or used they gotchu covered! New releases or previous release you've missed out on. Prices are decent and market value. This isn't tour local footlocker so if you're looking for older,limited,hype,exclusives this is the place to go. Staff is friendly and will explain the shoes or talk sneakers if that's what you want. Store has a dope set up and is separated by sizes so you can strictly look at the shoes in your size range. Highly recommend it if it's what you're looking for.",positive
"All that Pipe in there just gets me excited...and by pipe, I mean the amazing pipe racks that the shoes are displayed on. Some people have issues with money and the pricing of this place but hey its consignment, look it up in the dictionary. No one forces you to sell your shoes there or buy. This group has been always friendly to me and they also work with the community.",positive
"Top notch shoe boutique. If you're into limited sneakers look no further. Great selection, friendly helping staff and descent prices. Best shoe spot I've been to in AZ hands down.",positive
Killer kicks. Sum sexy thangs I never seen b4. Chingas of LeBron samples and other rare shits. Owner bnapes is courtois kind and helfpul and has many pretty tattoos. This shop is a must for sneaker hedz and they just opened a store in LA #p4pknockoutpunch,positive
"Shoe lovers beware. These guys will act all friendly and act as if they want to help with the sneaker community. But that's not the case. The skinny I met these guys a few years ago at several different shoe shows (dxc heated sole) I thought we had built a relationship that was friendly. I purchased (2 shoes) and I sold a few pairs of shoes through them which they charge 20% no problem they sold my shoes and said they would have someone call me to pick up a check well after a few weeks I noticed my shoes had sold but no call I waited another week before I decided to call, they lied and said they just sold the day before and I was going to get a call soon. I went to pick up check I noticed my other shoes had sold as well but they didn't tell me either I let it go as I got my money but felt like they were not telling people as they didn't have enough money to cover checks,They have no policy in place for holding a check and they seemed to get upset when I asked about it. I would call in to ask if they can relist my shoes on their Instagram page Brandon seemed to have an issue with and said he would have someone look into it but nothing was done. God forbid you go in there and ask about prices being so high they will give you this attitude about prices being set by customers when in fact they recommend pricing as they want to get as much as they can. There is always 2-3 staff hanging out in there and makes it awkward when ur the only shopper and they are just standing there looking at you. Please be careful of the services they offer, they let me know that they can do a legit check on a shoe for me (make sure they aren't fakes or variants) I thought that was great as there is a lot of fake shoes out here. I finally worked out a deal for a very limited an expensive shoe that I needed to get a legit check so I had the guy meet me there, we go in and it checks out and as I'm closing the deal, Brandon offered him more money that I was able to give. No apology no nothing just a s@$t eating smile like he won the lottery. He also was boastful online about it as to throw it more in my face. Real questionable business ethics, I won't do business with this store again.",negative
Always what I get from Privity Boutique! So easy online if I can't get down to the store too. Spoiler alert. . .lots of Christmas gifts purchased here!,positive
All of the clothes are either juniors or petite sizes - BEWARE. I am normally between a 6 and an 8 and I couldn't even get my arms in a shirt that was XL. She does not tell you this up front and does not offer refunds - only exchanges for other tiny clothes. DO NOT shop here unless you actually are petite. Or in junior high school.,negative
"Just a heads up, the item I received was not like the photo. I ordered a size large because I wanted a looser fit, but the dress was tight and the sleeves were really short and tight. A medium is typically loose on me, so I was shocked. The model must have been just 100 lbs., which would be valuable information for anyone shopping on this site. The worst thing is that I paid for shipping and now I have to pay for return shipping. I asked the owner why I had to pay for return shipping since the dress was misrepresented on the web site...she did not even respond to me. I will never shop at this site again and will do everything I can to get the word out on social media about what happened. Not responding is just rude...and it's just bad business.",negative
The owner is amazing and sweet. I spent a fortune here and I wanted to keep buying more. What started out as an online order (I didn't know they were in AZ) ended up being my new favorite store! I'm so happy i sum led across their Pinterest posts. I'm hooked and have told all my friends!,positive
I purchased a dozen or so different jewelry and clothing items from this store for my wife for Christmas. Like a lot of husbands it was last minute (Dec 23rd). I knew very well that my wife would probably need to exchange some items for different sizes or styles but made the mistake of not asking specifically about their return/exchange policy. It's now January 5th and my wife goes in to make the exchanges and is told she can not because there policy is 7 days. They never told me this or mentioned it at all. I was glad to have supported a local small business but now I'm just thoroughly disappointed. Unless you are there trying on the items I would stay far away from this store and if you are buying a gift don't even think about it.,negative
"Don't buy here if there's a chance you will need to return or exchange something. To start off, my 13 year old daughter and her grandmother (my mother) came into this store Sunday, November 19th. The store was getting close to closing, but they were allowed to shop and purchase their items. My daughter asked if she could try her items on, but she was told the fitting room was closed, and she would need to check out. The next day, she tried on her items, and one pair of pants she purchased did not fit properly. I told her to put the pants back in the bag, with the receipt and we will exchange them. They literally sat in my closet the entire time. We came in last night(within the normal 14 day exchange policy) and the store did not carry the next size up pants, so she chose other items to purchase. When we were ready to exchange the pants (and purchase additional items), we were asked where the tag was that came on the pants. There were multiple other manufacture tags on the pants, I did not notice the tag with the sku number was missing. My daughter said she did not remove any tags on her own, and she was unsure where the tag was either. The cashier went to speak to her manager (I assume) Sammy. Sammy came up to the register, did not even greet us and speak kindly of their policies about missing tags, she abruptly blurted out ""How can I exchange these pants without the tag?!"" I explained we did not remove any tags. Could it have possibly fell off or maybe the pants were sold to her without the tag? Who knows. I told her the exact same pants are on the wall, if she could please just use that tag to scan and do the exchange. (As I said earlier, all other tags were still on the pants, this was the only missing tag). Sammy started rudely saying, ""What is all this white stuff on here?"" Then she started lint rolling the pants with tape. The pants were black with white LINT. They were in perfect condition! She looked at the pants up and down over and over, as if trying to find a reason to tell me she couldn't do the exchange. She said she can do the exchange this one time. The cashier gave us all purchased items in a bag, without a receipt. I asked for the receipt, then she printed it, with FINAL SALE on it even for the new items we had just purchased. I asked why does this say final sale? Sammy told me because I returned an item without a tag. I asked what about the 3 other items I JUST bought? She told me it's all final sale because the pants I returned have pet hair and a stain. I told her that was impossible and to show me the stain. She was not able to point out the stain, but pointed out the WRINKLE on the pants that sits behind the knee saying it was worn. I told her it was not worn, if it was, why would all the other tags still be on the pants? I said she tried it on, so its not our fault if the pants have a small wrinkle, that to me is insane to even point that out! She said it was her store policy and I could not get a normal receipt for the new items. I took her name and told her I was contacting corporate. This is terrible customer service and being accused of being dishonest. They will never get my business again.",negative
Don't ever work here. They will talk about you behind your back and be very rude towards you. I was told to come in to get my last check and all i got were dirty looks and my check. Manager didn't even walk out to hand me my check. They will fire you for no absolute reason!!!,negative
I always hit this store when I'm at the mall but the girls that work here are always so so rude! Even when I smile at them I get nothing but a rude a** smirk. It has happened on multiple occasions not just once wish they would really think through who they hire!,negative
"This is mainly for the service/employees- im giving them 1 star. I shop here a good amount of times & everytime I'm in the girls are so rude, don't even acknowledge you and always act annoyed. I've been seeing this as a trend so thought it would be good to post a review about it. Coming out of the dressing room, my friend and I were talking to the girl and she didn't say 1 word back to us, she ignored us and gave us a blank, nasty stare like we were some animals and she wanted nothing to do with us. Then we go to cashier to check out and we were looking at nail polish and she told us not to touch it? Mind you, we are 24 years old not 15 we are actually shopping. Now, I act smart back to them since everytime I go in they are rude. It happens every time. Maybe the owner should give them a little chat on how to treat paying customers.",negative
Very disappointed with the employees at this location. After shopping for almost an hour I went to the dressing room only to be told that the store was closed. None of the employees bothered to announce that they would be closing soon or even mentioned it when I asked them for help. Total waste of my time and terrible customer service.,negative
"This store has an awful exchange policy, I had my receipt and tag piece was on the clothing, price must if fallen off, would not even exchange it! I will never shop there again ! Policy is horrible!",negative
"I love this store and everything about it the clothes are so cute and very very cheap for the quality which is amazing. I usually have a great experience here but this time I had bought something little and the cashier asked if I wanted a bag and I said yes and she cashed me out, then she put my item on the counter with an unopened bag on top of it and just walked away.. She knew I wanted a bag because she put one on the counter but she had an attitude because I wanted such a small item in a bag because I like putting my other bags in one to keep track better. Over all she was rude and didn't have the greatest customer service",negative
"DD went back-to-school shopping in here. It's a large store with a lot of merchandise, but they do a pretty good job of keeping things spaced out and uncluttered. There were many fashionable items for the low (think Forever 21). If you're shopping here make sure you are certain about your purchase. Some of their sale items have a No Return policy; other's you have to return within a week or so. And there is no cash back here. When I was checking out, the employee asked if I shopped for myself too. Girl... This is definitely a teen-to-20-something store; don't let them fool you into believing anything else. This store is located on the top floor, on the side of the mall that The Thirsty Lion is on (but up one floor).",positive
"Sylvester was very helpful in helping my son find the right tux for his homecoming dance. The prices are very reasonable and I especially appreciate the deal he gave me on the shoes. Also, I returned the tux a day late and was forgiven a late fee. I would definitely recommend this store for tuxedo rental.",positive
I just wanted to thank ReadyTux. The price alone let us get the other things we needed..and your staff made the fitting painless for us. Thank you soo much.,positive
Amazing services. Matched the tux to the dress perfectly. We could not of been happier. Thank yall so much!!! Married 11/9/15 Sylvester and Brendon yall are awesome sauce,positive
"Ready tux is a great little Shop with quote friendly service. The owner Sylvester helped me personally, and ordered me the perfect jacket for my wedding. He then surprised it by having it tailored and ready to go in no time at all. I'd recommend checking it out",positive
The guy was really fast at selling the product and did not even explain how the measurements would fit. All he wanted was fast cash. I'm an unsatisfied customer and will never shop at Ready Tux ever again. Bottom line DO NOT shop there.,negative
"I am so relieved this business finally has it's own Yelp. I tried looking for it last year and found nothing. I myself did not rent from here, but there was a wedding in our family and my dad and 2 other Uncles decided to rent their tuxes from here. Initially I heard the terrible experience my Uncle first had and I didn't really think anything of it until it was my dad's turn. So my dad went in for his initial fitting and the gentleman who helped him out told him it will be ready on Friday to try for a second fitting, unfortunately my dad was too busy to come in and hoped 1 fitting should be sufficient. CONTRARY TO BELIEF IT WAS NOT! The day of the wedding my dad puts on the pants and they are way too short. The pants were above his ankle. I initially thought this was unacceptable especially the fact the prices here are pretty standard for the tux rental industry and the fact they are located at the Boulevard Mall. I was so upset I myself returned the tux after because I wanted to speak to the gentleman and potentially get a refund. Well immediately walking I saw the sign at the cash register, no refunds. But I sure did try to get a word with the employee who assisted my dad and uncle and he sure was stiff as a brick. I even gave him a spiel on fitting people properly because I worked in retail for 4 years, so I definitely know a thing or two about that. All he could say to me was if he had come in the day before, it could have been fixed. UHH NO, this should only take 1 try not 2! BASICALLY DO NOT COME HERE!",negative
"My go-to grocery store. Always has great deals, fresh produce, and is never crowded. I buy most of my meats here because they have fantastic club packs. My only complaint so far is that during my last visit I was more or less bullied into signing up for a PC MasterCard. I told the staff member 6 or 7 times that no, I did not want to sign up, but I finally caved when he said he would follow me and fill it out as I shopped. Staff needs to step DOWN on the persuasiveness as it became very uncomfortable for me.",positive
"This is the closest store to Marriot Couryard and Riadissan. It is great that it opens late until 11 pm. I would say they are similar to a Walmart. For a traveler if you forgot any necessities from home, this is a good place to go and not that far from these 2 hotels in Calgary nor the airport. It is super convenient as there are no other grocery stores near the hotels.",positive
Get groceries every week. There is a good life fitness here too. Now they let you order your groceries online and pick them up.,positive
You stand in electronics for a half hour I Finnaly find an employee ask to get a game she says and employee took the key home so you can't get your game I'm like wtf the manager doesn't have a fucking key like this store is bullshit all the staff don't know anything I have to show customers where shit is and I don't even. Work their,negative
"My expectations are always so low when I go into Superstore and this visit was no exception. Here is a quick summation of what to expect. Me in aisle 5 (baking) scanning the shelves for vegetable shortening. *Sigh* none to be found. *idea* runs to aisle 4 (oils) still nothing. *Sees a worker, first one in 20 mins* Runs to her... Me: Hi there, do you know what aisle has vegetable shortening? Worker: Aisle 5 Me: Checked, wasn't there. Worker: Aisle 4 Me: I checked there too. Worker: *embarrassed* oh, sorry, I don't know what vegetable shortening is. *Scurries away* Me: *shocked emoji-face* If you like reading the small print on documents, this is the place for you! Under closer speculation, about 80% of the price tags have ""when you buy in groups of 2"" or other some other catch. The reason I still go to Superstore is usually under duress of my household.",negative
"This place was a great find. They have a huge produce section. My only gripe was not everything was that easy to find, but I could find most everything if I did some searching.",positive
"Why didn't anyone write a review yet for this ? Were you all waiting for me :P . I see a lot crowd visiting this canadian store including me. Anyway glad to be the first to review it. It is at a very convenient location which is near by to calgary transit and has ample of parking space. I visit this place very often for my groceries. They have different sections and one for asian too. So I could get many of the necessary goods(indian groceries) which are not available at other places for such a low price. Even they have pretty many options in rice. Always the prices are much lower when compared to anyother store either in downtown or surrounding area. Vegetables are fresh except on few days.( usually they refill during fridays). They have lot of varities in snacks,bread,cakes,seafood,chicken. We get here chinese okra, bottle gaurd, Indian karela, Eggplant, Indian okra and many other distinct varieties in all sections which makes it unique from other stores. Never to worry about the price as it is always the best price on any good. Some suggestions: 1. Rice- Nessa brand is good and cheaper to. Comes to $9 for 5Kg which has a good quality than other brands. Go on weekdays if you want to get one. This is a very fast moving one. 2. You get coconut water here in cans. 3. Carry your own bags as they charge you for the bags they give you to carry the purchased goods. Sorry for throwing light mostly on Asian goods because I got to try only those. Good that, it leaves some points for others to review on :).",positive

"OMG! I searched all over for a wig like the one I had purchased over a year ago and ruined by cutting it myself. I have bought wigs at the swap meet for over $200 (lowest price available there anymore!) and just did not want to spend that much again. Walked into this store (my husband remembered where it was), found the exact wig to replace mine (WELL, WELL under $200!) and Ms. Equilla spent over 1/2 hour carefully trimming and shaping my wig. The store is clean and professional looking; the staff is warm, friendly, and talented; and I will go back often and tell my friends. I think finding this location again was my holiday miracle!",positive

"Last year I was looking for a wig for my Halloween costume. Thinking I'd only wear it once, I didn't want to spend a lot of money. However, I couldn't find anything that would work at the costume stores (I was going as Ginger from Gilligan's Island). Someone recommended Reese's Wigs so I grudgingly went there, expecting to spend a lot of money. When I got there and started talking to the salesperson about what I needed I was pleasantly surprised. She was very pleasant and accommodating, showing me some options that were much more affordable than I expected. Sure, it was more than I had originally expected to spend, but it fit well, didn't itch the crap out of me, and looked great! Oh, and guess what? I pulled the wig out of the box a year later, brushed it out (have you ever tried to brush those cheap costume wigs? Ugh!!) and it looks brand new! I am now wearing it a second time for this year's Halloween party. I'm sure I'll get quite a few more wearings out of it. If I ever need another wig again, Reese's Wigs will be the first place I go!",positive
Bought a wig and was not told while buying that they do not accept returns. 30 minutes after my purchase I found a wig down the street I liked. They would not allow me to return the wig even though I just purchased it 30 minutes ago.,negative
"A month and a half ago my 74 year old Mother's scalp was severely burned by a negligent hairstylist. Every week that passed by, more and more of her hair fell out. Her confidence disappeared and she was emotionally wrecked. Finally Mom made the decision to get a wig. A friend of hers recommended Reese's. Both Mom and I were a little nervous about walking into a wig shop, but the second we opened the door of Reese's we were greeted by Equilla West and the discomfort disappeared. Equilla guided us through the process of selecting a a wig that matched my Moms style and price. She even helped Mom with fitting and trimming the wig to Mom's desired length. While looking around the shop, I had the pleasure of speaking with Reese Dossa (The owner) and his Mom, Sherin Dossa. They were as equally as kind and made sure we were 100% satisfied with the process, product and they took the time to explain the the take-home care instructions. I can't say enough good things about this business and our experience. I feel like I want to stop by just to say hi if I was in the neighborhood (They are that welcoming and kind!) If you are contemplating trying out a wig, please go to Reese's first. You won't need to go anywhere else. They have everything. You don't have to worry about anything at all. My Mother is a different person now that she's wearing her wig. She has her confidence back and she looks beautiful. Thank you to Everyone at Reese's for such a great experience and for the wonderfully supportive atmosphere. I will never forget how much you helped my Mom. Love, Michelle",positive
"My experience at Reese""s Wigs couldn't have been any better! The experience was great, they took care of me and showed me amazing personalized care and hospitality. The staff helped me choose the perfect wig for me, they also made sure the adjustments were perfect, they also showed me to snap in the wig. My wig is truly amazing. It is better than I could have ever imagined. After chemotherapy my hair has been growing at slow pace which took away from my self esteem and image, but after Reese's made this wig for me it's hard to hide the smile on my face. I love my wig thank you guys so much for doing such an amazing job and treating me like a queen.",positive
"I was in town for the day and have been wanting to purchase a wig for some time. I stopped in Reese's and was greeted by Rochelle. Even though I'm pretty sure she just started working there, she was wonderful. So warm and friendly and very helpful. I tried on about 3 or 4 wigs and ended up purchasing the first wig I tried on. It was a bit more than I had planned on spending but after ordering wigs online and having to return them because I didn't like the fit or the quality it was well worth it. I loved the personal attention and the service from Rochelle. All in all it was a great experience.",positive
"If you've ever thought of buying a wig you have to go here! Sharin & Equilla were awesome!!! When my sister & I walked in were immediately greeted with a friendly hello & were given the opportunity to look around without any high pressure. We had so much fun trying on different styles & didn't feel like we were annoying the staff. We had been to Serge's Wigs prior to coming to Reese's & it was not a fun experience. Besides the fact their prices were much Both my sister & I brought two wigs. It takes awhile to find the right ones but with the professional help & many, many wigs later we were very happy with our choices. SO...once again I must say go to Reese's if you are in the market for a wig. They make it a fun experience!",positive

"I wouldn't suggest this business to someone who's had a decent experience with other places. When I came in, I was welcomed to the store. However, that's as far as it went with a positive experience. Everywhere throughout the store I was followed by an aggressive employee who did not leave much distance, and I suspect followed me due to prejudice. That is a harsh thing to say, but I rarely ever get (obviously) followed by an employee in much smaller stores. I wasn't even dressed ""suspiciously"" and explained to her in advance I was interested in looking to gauge any potential future purchases due to a previous purchase not panning out well (due to my time range). When I asked her about a specific question about fiber types she deflected the question, saying ""Well, we have many types of wig fibers here"". I expect more knowledgeable information coming from someone who's trying to sell me an expensive wig. I also expect more professional behavior to come from someone in such a shop. It made me feel very uncomfortable and turned me off from purchasing in the future. I couldn't personally complain about prices- storefronts are always more expensive than online purchases. That is a given. However, the wigs are a bit shiny for the price range, and did not have as much hair. I imagine they would work well for someone who does not want to go out of their way to find a wig or who wishes to get what they expect. But for those who are willing to take more of a chance, online wig purchasing from a reliable source is a better experience. Cosworx is a local wig seller in Las Vegas, mainly for cosplay or lolita fashion. Although they don't have a storefront, I would recommend their products ahead of this shop, or almost any shop for that matter.",negative
"I have never wanted or needed a wig in my entire life.....until earlier this year. I have also never gone shopping for a wig, so I had no idea what to expect. I remembered seeing this place, driving down Sahara one day. My mother and I decided to stop by and were immediately greeted by two employees when we walked in. We ended up spending over an hour at the store! Lisa helped us the entire time. She was very friendly, patient, and made good suggestions. I definitely learned a lot about wigs! After trying on a bunch of them, I finally found the one that I liked and could live with. Unfortunately, they did not have the color I wanted in stock, so they had to order it. No problem though, as I did not need it right away. It took about a week to come in. The only drawback was the prices. Expect to spend at least $200 on a synthetic wig. Human hair ones can be in the $700 + range. They also offer styling services, where they wash and re-shape your wig. I took advantage of this, and although it cost me $33, I know that if I tried to wash it myself, I would have screwed it up somehow. Very convenient and it took about 3 days. When I picked it up, it looked brand new! I would definitely recommend Reese's! Wig shopping is not easy and it just takes time to find that right one. The employees here will help you with everything and I was happy with my purchase!",positive
Prices are fair and the quality is way much more nicer than any Gap I've ever seen. The women's perfume Roots is one of my favorites but is getting hard to find in the States unfortunately. Please dont ever discontinue the zip up sweatshirts! I practically live in those during Fall.,positive
Had an item placed on hold on a Friday evening. Received a call that night at 9:30 pm while at dinner basically telling me they sold the item to another customer as ordered by the manager. Will never do business with this company.,negative
"45 $ for a crappy backpack is pricey in my humblest opinion...not that the Gap is any better. Yes, the staff is very friendly and courteous, the store is neatly organized and so forth but the clothes and bags are overpriced And for those who love the Quebec style (not exactly similar to European, unless you have never been to Europe) all they have to do is wear the same pair of jeans and the same jacket for 4 months without any washing...add a scarf, plastic over-sized sunglases and voilà...that`s the Quebec, or so-called European look....so chic....",negative
"If you've ever wondered why Canadians dress so badly, the answer is simple: Roots. Roots clothing is much like the way Americans perceive Canadians: boring and inoffensive. Thankfully, here in Quebec, people are more stylish and dress far better than their Anglo Canadian counterparts and you don't see many people in Montreal (besides McGill students) wearing Roots clothing. In fact, Roots may be reason enough to argue for Quebec separation if only to keep out the ugly sweatpants and stultifyingly generic preppy wear.",negative
"I think Roots is much better than the Gap - better quality (their stuff will last for ages), and a bit more sports focused in general. The prices aren't too bad, especially if you hit their sales or their outlet locations. I've always appreciated Roots because they don't use outlandish colors, even when they're ""in season"" - which is good for me because I like to blend in. But they're not too bland - just nice lookin' stuff.",positive
"This place is ""the best"". We walked in the last minute to attend my sons prom last night. Sami stepped in and, let me say this""she is the best at what she does!"". Her customer service is superb, a bubbly personality and we are going to make this happen attitude. The price of the tux was well worth it. Thank you Sami and Rose.",positive
"This is an excellent tuxedo shop that takes care of its customers, they really go out of their way to make sure you will have the best experience. I really appreciate their knowledge and their expertise and I highly recommend this place to anyone who is looking to get fitted for a tux.",positive
"Stopped in at Rose Tuxedo on a Friday evening needing a tuxedo for Saturday night. Angelo met me at the door, was enthusiastic and ready to help. The customer service was top notch! Angelo, laid out all the options, had me measured and out the door within 20 minutes. The next morning my Tuxedo was ready for pickup at the Indian School location. Angelo offered to have it available for pick up at the 35th Ave location, but it worked out better for me to pick it up at the Indian School location. The tux fit perfectly, I was very pleased with the style and the fit. I'll be a repeat customer and would recommend Rose Tuxedo to anybody whether they need a Tuxedo in a hurry or are planning for an event in advance.",positive
We had some issues with our suits but after speaking with the manager he made it better and addressed the problems we had.,negative
"Rose Tuxedo has some of the most designer tuxedos I could find in Phoenix and the surrounding cities. I searched for months and months, and finally saw their web site online and I was sold. I had 10 groomsman, who all agree and love the tuxedo rental prices and the employees were awesome! Try them I think you will be happy.",positive
Great place needed to rent some suits for my groomsmen and the lady was very helpful. This is a great place if you need to rent suits or tuxedos.,positive
"I spoke with the owner, Angelo, today. He said he did not hear of my son's bad experience back in May 2013 & he had not seen my yelp review until recently. He seemed sincerely apologetic for our bad experience at Rose Tuxedo and was willing to fix things. I think anyone that is willing to go out of his way to fix their mistake & make things right, like this owner is doing, definitely deserves to keep our business. Thank you for your understanding & for making it right, Angelo!",positive
We were very happy with the service we recently recieved at Rose Tuxedo. The staff was very friendly and treated us like kings. They had a great selection and their prices beat everyone else. We will definitely go back to Rose Tuxedo in the future and recommend it to our friends.,positive
"I attended a recent wedding in Phoenix and was one of the groomsman. I came in from out of town on the Friday and stopped by Rose Tux to try on and pick up my tux. Angelo, the owner, and his staff were great. They made sure everything fit properly and the prices were great. Much better than what I was charged for one in Houston.",positive
"Dear Sams, I've been a long time costco customer but recently I decided to switch over to you because you are conveniently located. I've heard good things from friends who shop with your company which made me consider getting a membership in the first place. I wish I could say that I see what they were talking about but unfortunately my experiences have not been great. My problem is not so much the service but the products, specifically the food court. I've been to this location on 3 separate occasions and all 3 times I have recieved food of extremely burned quality. And I do mean poor quality. The food has been burned and it has been old. This has been the case with the chicken sandwich, hot dogs and the pizza. On the first 2 visits I didn't want to make a big deal, however after experiencing this for a third time straight...this can't be a coincidence and I can't be the only one with this issue. I can't imagine that every Sam's Club has the same issue so I would encourage you to review your food service standards and even inspect the equipment used to try to correct this issue.",negative
They raised the price of gas like 15 cent raise same as a regular gas station at a store . We pay a member ship should be less . Because of Texas. I think that its gouging. Just because it just happened 15 cent raise is bad .,negative
"Shopping for a large family can be expensive and often you don't get much to show for it! Not the case here! You ... well I usually spend at least 100 bucks here each trip and can eat off most of the items for about 2 weeks or longer if canned goods or pastas! Also, I must say they have a great bread selection I can get a pack of 12 pitas for about 4 bucks! You usually get 4 for 4 at smaller stores! The romaine lettuce comes in 6 packs those last about 2 weeks and cost just 4 bucks also! Sams is full of great deals and I really encourage you to invest in a card if you have a large family, throw parties, or even have growing kids!",positive
"I came to pick up some water.... got charged for more... got sent to member services for the difference... 1 cashier to about 10 persons... been in line for 20 minutes... on the positive side, the time it took me to write this, I'm one person closer",negative
"Welcome to your Neighborhood Bulk Warehouse Store, where you can buy almost anything from business supplies, to grocery items, clothing, and household equipment. Not to mention a Pharmacy, Photo Shop, and a Auto Service Center as well. The layout of this Sam's is/are all the same. They all carry the same merchandise, some more than others. The only drawback to this one compared to the others? The lack of available cashiers. It seems like each time I go here, there are only 3 or for Cashiers working the registers, any time of day. The workers at the food court need a crash course in Guest Interaction. She was not very friendly, and gave a lot of people before me attitude. I'm sorry if you were having a bad day Miss, but no one deserves that kind of Customer Service! Overall, I would have to say that when you shop here, The Service could be a Hit or Miss!",negative
"This Sams is the one on Craig rd. This is the one that's closest to where I live, and it's convenient for me to go to. This place is OK, but the one thing that I don't like is the fact that they don't have sushi like so many of the other Sam's clubs do. It would be nice if they were to offer that option, because I'm pretty sure I'm not the only one that's not for sushi there before. I thought all Sam's Clubs we're consistent, I guess not. So whenever I can, I take a trip to the one on South rainbow, buy what I need and pick up some sushi while I'm there as they do offer that option. So just know that you will not be able to find sushi here if you want to pick some up while you're shopping at Sam's Club on Craig Road.",positive
"I was shopping for families for the school I work at to help out for Christmas. I had a huge cart of breakfast items to donate to our families and as I went to check out I got my total and began to pull out the cash that had been donated to our school. The cashier saw I had a large amount of $1's (which I know is annoying...I didn't even want to pay with it but it's what I had). The cashier proceeded to say, ""Are you serious?"" I told her yes. She rolled her eyes and huffed and puffed through the whole transaction. At the end she raised both arms and loudly told the other customers in line ""this is not my fault"" and pointed at me. This was unprofessional and embarrassing for me. I called the manager at this location and am awaiting a phone call. Hoping they make this right especially during the holiday season. I felt like I couldn't even help my families without being treated poorly because she didn't want to count out ones.",negative
"If you call this store to check the availability of an item, they will keep you on hold for 20 mins or more until you decide to hang up because you have been waiting for so long.",negative
"I come here almost every week it's clean and most of the time the employees are helpful. I just baffles me when you ask loud and clearly for something and they just balantly ignore you. I'll be willing to drive the extra miles to Costco to receive better customer service. I've been in customer service since I was a teenager and believe in excellent customer service. You're a professional act like it. It's not like my request was much, all I wanted was a box. Rude.",negative
Gasoline is consistently More Expensive than at COSTCO on Decatur or the Sam's Club in Centennial Shopping Center. This store is also never as Clean as the other two stores and the Lines are always long since the clerks have to completely empty your basket (Yes even the heavy water packs) because I guess they don't trust their Customers? Prices for electronics are consistently cheaper at other stores as are most items where there is little savings realized by purchasing in bulk. Know your price as this is a Walmart owned operation and in many cases while the product is the same price as COSTCO the value is less - even down to the width of the Toilet Paper.,negative
"I buy bulk so I shop at sams club. Lines can get long in the afternoon but shouldn't take too much of your time. I like that they Gave boxes for customers to use, I know because it saves cost to use bags. large frozen section. Some meats are marked down from original price which helps some people who are on a budget. Especially some items are organic pretty cool for some people who like non gmo, pesticide free, vegan, and gluten free.",positive
I come to this location for the super friendly and helpful pharmacy staff. I switched over from a regular drugstore that was hard to fill rx in a timely manner to a place that can have my rx ready in 20 mins or less!!! Kim and Mariana are the best!!,positive
"Ive been a customer since 07. Cancelled my membership a few times due to the lack of customer service, but since Costco is a little further from home I keep coming back... Just recently my mother renewed the membership. So I go on to pick up my copy. First thing the guy is having a full conversation with some girl and just asked me ""how can I help"" in a very script way. Second he proceeds to tell me that my mom would have to come with me to get my card. Why if I'm just changing card?? Then he is oh well anyways I cant even fund you in the system you need to purchase a new membership. Very rude unprofessional service.",negative
I'm a member of both Sam's and Costco. I get gas at this Sam's every couple of weeks and visit the store once or twice a month. I've had very good expereinces with the staff the last several times shopping here. I also attended there pre Black Friday event where you could upgrade your phone for an inexpensive price.). I was very happy with how organized everything was with the process. They made appointments for everyone and also had a complimentry snack cart for the early birds who were waiting outside in the cold to get it. I also eat at the snack bar and the place is almost always a madhouse. The snack bar staff works incredibly hard to serve everyone. Overall I feel the staff here does a pretty good job. I think the merchandise as a whole at COSTCO is better but have no problem shopping here.,positive
"We went to Sam's Club tonight and had an Ok experience. Understandably, it felt like we were shopping in a warehouse, but it would have been a little more enjoyable if the clerks at least acted like they cared. A smile and a friendly attitude costs nothing and goes a long way to winning over customers.",negative
"Great place for bulk grocery shopping since I live close by. They have a variety of shopping needs for your everyday life from frozen food, snacks, house items, clothes, movies, toys, vegetables, fruits, etc. I've had no problem getting in & out of this place. My only gripe is the long lines during the busy times. I wish they would open up more registers when the lines are long! Other than that I would recommend this place for anyone thinking of signing up for a membership. I also enjoy their gas & carwash too.",positive
"Never really had an urge to go here. It was by coincidence that my aunt was in town for a birthday for one of my nephews. I just happen to not be doing anything on a saturday so I ended up driving her here. My aunt has a Sam's Club that is only about 10 minutes away from her house up in Renton, Wa. She also has a Costco membership but that place was more like a half hour drive. Im telling you guys right now why she got a Sam's Club membership is because of two things. Convenience and the fact that Sam's Club carries a little bit more different products. Originally I was gonna wait in the car for my aunt but I was curious so I tagged along. Plus I wouldnt want her to push around what I would assume a really full cart around the store. As the cart was virtually starting to overflow I wondered if she was the only one handling this birthday party. From my observance, there are a lot of similarities to Costco. The building size is virtually the same along with the set up of aisles classified by category. Even the food court was similar. When it was all said and done, we ended up getting another cart because the first cart was spilling over already. Total bill was about 370 dollars. In my opinion, the difference between these guys and Costco is that Sam's Club has a bit more product choices but Costco has better prices. Even the Sam's Club gas was about the same as any gas station down the street. It was at 2.99 a gallon while Costco was at 2.55. Membership is about the same price. 100 bucks for the executive and about 50 bucks for the basic. In closing, I prefer Costco. Dont get me wrong, this place is ok with me. I dont care if they were right down the street from me, I would still do my normal shopping at Costco when it comes to saving by buying in bulk. Yelp 2015 Review #65 563 overall",negative
I go there just to see Larry the attendent the most friendly guy and good prices on gas. Car wash is ok could be better,positive
"I have been a Costco member since 1998 and after my experience at this Sam's Club, it reminded me why I don't belong to SC. I came on a ""guest pass"" and didn't have a great experience. As I looked around I wasn't impressed by the selection of things offered compared to Costco. The food court certainly could use some work. I did have a pleasant experience with one of the cashiers where you check out, but the girl working in the food court that helped me was another story. When I asked for my pizza to-go, she said that it wasn't her job to do that. I was a bit shocked and asked her if I was even able to get it to-go? She said yes, but that I'd have to go down to the end of the counter and wrap it with foil myself. I had no issue with doing this, I just had no idea about the foil or I wouldn't have asked to begin with. I decided to get a slice of pizza and a churro. The churro was .99 cents and tasted stale and hard, barely having any cinnamon or sugar taste to it. I didn't want a drink, so I just got 1 slice of cheese pizza priced at $1.98 and it came cut in 2 pieces. The pizza tasted terrible. I took 2 bites and then just threw it away. The pizza was sort of burnt on top and just didn't taste good. I had some return issues on items purchased when I came back a couple days later and with everything else I experienced, I can't see coming back period.",negative
Love this store always everything i need and so cheap when you have a family ain't nothing like sams club im always here love this place and my family loves it we can spend 3 hours in there then be like wow we been here 3 hours already lol,positive
Wow! The worst service ever all employees had an attitude and was quick to respond with a rude attitude I hate places like this!!!! Ima just stick with Costco !!! Ugh!!!! I'm so mad!!!!!! Even if they offer me somethin I wouldn't come back !!!,negative
"We have memberships to both Costco and Sam's - mainly because we moved and there's Sam's right next door. The Sam's Club experience is the opposite of everything we hate about trips to Costco. No matter what time of week/day it is, it's never swarming with people who have seemingly never shopped in a public place, it's easy to find parking, the staff is friendly and they have some great Gluten Free options. :) Now we visit nearly every weekend.",positive
terrible customer service no manager available when it takes 25 minutes to make a pretzel and a previous visit they shut yogurt machine down 2 hours before closing,negative
By far the friendliest Sam's Club I ever been to. I went first thing in the morning and the place was pretty much empty. I was in and out in 30 minutes. Friendly employee helped me carry by 50lbs bag of rice. even suggested that I go online and place a order and arrange a pick up date. They will pull the items for me. How awesome is that! I love it!,positive
"Sam's club ia a bit like a bigger version of walmart made like a sort of Costco. But Costco set the bar way up there. And usually Sam's Club isn't too shabby but shit I went to this sams club because it was close. The first time I went it was to look around and the second time I just wanted a hot dog and my god what horrified me the most was their condiment area napkins cup covers and straw papers were everywhere it looks so dirty. It looked like it hadnt been cleanned for a week and the trash cans were overfilled. Today I went and I couldnt find parking! not because it was full but because of inconsiderate assholes leaving carts and trash all over the parking lot I also saw an individual that was outside who wasnt doing his job he was taking a smoke break. Correct me if i'm wrong but if the parking lot looked like shit people shouldnt have time to have smoke breaks, you should be making sure the place looks acceptable and not like garbage. And yeah its not his fault people suck but just like in resturants workers still have to clean up the place. And today the only condiment available was ketchup.. a hotdog is lonely without mustard and relish maybe onions. They should fix that. I dont want to eat a sad hotdog. The only reason ill still go to this sams is because the others are pretty far.",negative
Went in to replace a tire on my new car (already) I tell Asian dude w blue triangle earrings my tire size & he's like what does it look like(wtf) he starts pointing at tires like does it look like this ? Or this? Or this? I'm like I'm sorry I don't look @ my tires much (looks like a fucking tire to me) so I'm like are you able to look @ it or I can bring in a picture??? His attitude is like I'm wasting his 420 time all huffy n puffy & frustrated- dude if you hate looking @ & pricing tires then why the f did you put on the uniform again & come in today? Other dude w Boston also in the same mode. DOES THIS DEPT HV A MANAGER OR DID THESE TOO FOOLS TRANSFER FROM A WORK RELEASE PROGRAM FOR LAMES TO INTEGRATE INTO THE WORKFORCE??? Service here used to be quick friendly & dependable. I WOULD NEVER LEAVE MY SONS LIFE RIDING ON THESE TIRES IN THE HANDS OF THESE 2,negative
Well my wife and i go to sams alot for pet food and miscellaneous goodies we use alot ....the main thing to remember about sams is they sell in bulk.....BUT the samples and shopping experience is always a good one .....the downfall is you have to be a member which is about 50 bucks a month depending on what plan you get....but i really enjoy it for the bulk items,positive
"Grumpy, grumpy, grumpy cashiers! My husband tried to purchase a storage unit for inside the garage and was treated so rudely he wanted to apologize for disturbing them! Who needs this kind of treatment in this day and age!",negative
"This is not a bad Sams club. I love shopping there for stuff that are usually more expensive at normal grocery stores. The selection is ok, and the service could be better. We like to tank gas at their gas station, because their gas is usually 10 - 20 cents cheaper than other gas stations. We bought a grill from them in September which was discounted for 80 Dollars. We were very happy with the deal and loved our grill until it stopped working after only 2 months. We took it back and they had the same grill but for $199. We talked to the manager but he said there is nothing he can do for us and we have to pay the extra money to get an exchange. I thought this was pretty disappointing. We ended up getting the money back and going home without a new grill.",negative
This is one of the newer Sam's Clubs in town. It's not usually busy either. I barely ever see a lot of people here. Service here is spotty. It's either pretty good or pretty bad. I guess it depends on who you get. Selection is ok. Not as good as Costco but they also carry stuff that Costco might not have.,positive
Very good shoes and given how long they last worth the price! I brought my mom here who lives in West Virginia and she bought 3 pairs of shoes! The associates are friendly and professional. My mom is a retired school nurse and just loves SAS shoes.,positive
I walked into SAS Shoes and was pleasantly greeted by a female employee named Encina who had a bubbly personality and a friendly smile. I believe she was the only person working at the time because another customer walked in and no one else came to help her but she was very quick to greet the other customer and let them know that she would be with them shortly. I was very impressed by her multitasking skills seeing as we both wanted to see multiple types of shoes in different sizes. She was quick and efficient with sizing and gathering the boxes for both of us. She took her time answering all of my questions and she patiently walked me around the store and explained the different types of shoes and handbags to me as well as showed me the catalog and the shoes that were not carried in the store for more options. I was unsure about what type of shoe I was looking for but she still made sure to take her time with me while going back and forth between me and another customer. I never once felt pressured into purchasing anything and she still gave me reassurance about my options and I still felt like she had my best interest at heart. I've been into this store before and have had bad service from a black man and a girl with short black hair and was unsure about going into this store again but Encina has helped to change my mind. The store itself is very clean and has a ton of options for the most comfortable shoes. I didn't end up purchasing any shoes as I had a couple of other shoe stores to go to but I felt confident about wanting to return and recommending this store to others.,positive
I recently purchased a pair of their men's business shoe. They feel great. I am able to wear them up to 12 hours a day. It reminds me of wearing a tennis shoe. The sales associate was knowledgeable and friendly. I will be going back to buy another pair in the future.,positive
"Very bad customer service today!!!!!!! The dark haired woman (Becky?) was very RUDE & SHORT to my Mom. My Mom had just checked out of the hospital & needed to get shoes for my Dad who is in the hospital. They didn't listen and wouldn't even let my Mom finish her sentences!! THE STORE WAS EMPTY WITH NO OTHER CUSTOMERS!!! We have bought at least 3 pairs of shoes for my Dad at various SAS locations. The RUDE lady told her she couldn't find my Dad's size, and their database link from store to store. They didn't even offer to call the other store!!!!",negative
"I purchased some shoes for my mom a while back but they were too narrow. My mom never told me they did not fit and I threw away the receipt. I took my mom to exchange the shoes since they never did fit or were worn. After speaking to the store manager Carol, she said due to the fact that they were worn and we did not have a receipt there was nothing she could do. Mind you, SAS shoes are expensive and I decided to speak over the phone to the regional manager Lisa who accepted to return the shoes for an exchange. Carol decided to tell me she was going to do a one time courtesy exchange even though we were ABUSING THE RETURN POLICY!!! It was not only unprofessional but rude of Carol to make such a comment. It's very concerning to know there are employees as old as Carol to act in such manner.",negative
"Course was in great shape except for hole 1 which was being aerated but you couldn't beat the price. No driving range, but a very large putting green. Fairways are forgivable on some holes and target golf on others. Not too many hazards which will keep your ball in play. Love this course but it's a little far to go from my house.",positive
"Booked the round online with no mention of the course being plugged. Received an email from the manager saying the greens were airified and if we want to cancel we could. I was fine with it being only the greens except when we teed off we found out it was the entire course. This is a complete waste of a round, holes, mud and sand all over the place. Next time close the course or fully disclose to every one so no one wastes their money.",negative
Worst round of golf I have ever experienced. Way overbooked. Average of 2 foursomes waiting to tee off on every tee box. Never go back.,negative
"Silverado is a great track for a nice, relaxing round of golf. However, I write this out of appreciation. I left a pair of expensive shades in a cart on Thursday- they had them on Saturday for me. Appreciate the entire staff.",positive
Great course. For a public course it was in great shape. Greens ran true and the fairways were immaculate. Would play here again. Pace of play on a busy Sunday 4:15,positive
"Played here today for the first time. Every single person we encountered was wonderful! Two of our foursome were a bit late & they adjusted us no problem even though they were sold out until noon. The staff in the pro shop & bar were wonderful. The felt immediately comfortable there & had a great round of golf. The course has is great for amateurs, I only lost one ball.",positive
"Good fun course. Back 9 is a if fun, and staff is really friendly and helpful! Course is usually in pretty good condition as well",positive
Decent value course but not scenic. Fairways were okay. Greens were decent. Some patches were a little rough but not overly.,negative
"Fun layout for the casual golfer. Great greens, fairways and rough in excellent condition, tee boxes well kept. Their staff are quite friendly and helpful. Pace could have been a bit faster...7:08 time played in 4.5 hours, but well marshaled. Water every couple holes. Not too many houses to hit. Lots of gallery on the walking path throughout the course. I'll be back!",positive
"I'm still new to golf, but I've played this course 3 times. Still experimenting around the valley but found Silverado to be among the better kept courses. My only complaint is no driving range which means I have to go elsewhere to practice long balls. Otherwise, the staff has always been friendly to me and the course is beautiful. Went to practice putting for an hour or so and the gentleman at the bar gave me a free soda. Plus, who doesn't like complimentary cool wet towels at the end of a round? No issue with speed of play, which you'd think is because I'm still new, but you'd be surprised. (Western Skies, I'm talking to you.) Definitely will continue to be a frequent course for me. Try it out.",positive
This is a great course that can be very forgiving. The front 9 is wide open and the back 9 has more of a desert course feel. It can get backed up really quick so allow 5+ hours if you go late morning. While it can be a bit slow it is a great course overall.,positive
Overall not a bad little course I had a decent time but I was waiting at every tee box due to groups ahead of me. Cart girls are very attentive. Course is in great shape and prices are very reasonable. Course is very forgiving for first time players to the course. Would go here again if I have a chance.,positive
"I like this course, lots of grass, I don't really care for the typical desert courses found all over the valley. I will warn you this is a very slow course. Our tee time was 9:08 and we didn't even get started until like 9:30, we waited at almost every hole but only for like 5-7 minutes, not absurd but it does add up over 18 holes. It took about 5 1/2 hours to play 18 holes, a bit longer than I like. I only saw a Marshall one time and he just drove by. There aren't a lot of hazards on this course which is nice if your are a novice or a crappy golfer like me. However there still are some long & tricky holes if you are a decent golfer.",positive
"Course is amazing condition for summer time in the Phoenix area. Greens are no joke, the absolute best I've played this summer. Staff was friendly and got me out as a single ahead of a three-some. They have a nice putting and chipping area and there are three bays to hit some practice balls into. Layout is not too challenging but there are a couple holes to test your ability. All in all a very nice track to play. I definitely will be back.",positive
This course is on the less expensive end of the scale for Scottsdale which still means fairly pricey (I believe it was around $80-$90 per person in prime season in end of March?). There is no driving range but we went to one of the courses nearby beforehand which wasn't very far away. Overall though thought the course was pretty solid with a nice layout. Greens in good shape. Course had some challenges but also had an overall layout that seemed to keep the ball findable because everything sloped inward. Got out at 8:45 or so and played pretty quickly. Would definitely come back for more.,positive
I played at this course for the first time this past Saturday with some friends & felt the customer service was very poor. From one of the starters who didn't communicate with the pro shop to know that we were a foursome and wanted to be confrontational and act like we couldn't play together(until he found out he was in the wrong) to the beverage girls who seemed like we were bothering them every time they came around and we wanted to purchase drinks or food. Just overall bad customer service and felt that we were an inconvenience to almost every employee that we came into contact with.,negative
"The staff was completely disrespectful to us. They sent us out with a random player and then threatened to kick us off the course on hole 2, with no refund, if we didn't split up our group. The customer service was terrible but I'm biased considering the way they treated my group. The course is decent, wide open fairways but not very challenging. Overall not worth the $50 I spent.",negative
Iv accompanied my husband to almost all the golf courses in Phx and since past 1 year have nt been playing due to my fracture . I have never been charged for just riding in the cart b4 but this place charged us 18 bucks .. What a money making trick!!!,negative
"Nice, easy course but beware: you can reserve a threesome to find out that an old man will be your fourth, and he wants to date you. He proudly boasts that he only paid $20 when you and your peers paid $65/pp. Yickes!",negative
Great place to have lunch or a late breakfast. Reasonable prices and good food. The patio is especially nice when the weather is cool. Highly recommend!,positive
"One of the most fun rounds of golf I've played in a long time. Some challenging features, but plays pretty easy. Fairways were immaculate! Beautiful course, and they wiped down my clubs after my round (never had that happen anywhere else). Most definitely worth the very reasonable green fee, and I'll play here again if I ever find myself in Scottsdale again!",positive
"Slow!!! This the slowest golf course in the world. I have played there 3 times, all within the last year. I was only able to finish once because of the extremely slow play and that time took 5 1/2 hours. The other time they started me on the back, which was fine because it is the nicer of the two 9's, it took 2 1/2 hours to play. I go to make the turn on to the front and they just let 7 groups of walkers out on the front, even though they new a bunch of people would be making the turn because they started everyone else earlier on the back. Seeing this and then seeing the 5 groups waiting to tee of on 10, I went to the pro shop to kindly ask ""what's up?"", the guy with the creepy side burns and mustache basically told me I was screwed and said there was no chance of a rain check even though he admitted that it would take over 3 more hours to finish my round. For some stupid reason I went back again this past May. It took 2/12 hours to play the front and then it took 2 1/2 hours TO PLAY THE FIRST FOUR HOLES ON THE BACK!!! When we got to the 14th tee there were, NO KIDDING, 6 groups on the tee. NOT A MARSHALL IN SIGHT! We decided to quit and drive to the clubhouse, as did two other groups. When we got back to the club house, the bag guys asked how we enjoyed our round... knowing that we did not come from the 18th. We told them very politely how slow it was and there only response was ""ya, slow golf sucks"". Please find new management because this is a decent course, when you get to play the whole thing!",negative
"I am sorry to see so many bad things said about Silverado. Its one of my favorites. I golf mostly in the afternoons. We play at this course about 3 times a month. Never had a problem. My foursome even got to take off early. One time my dad (age 85) was late getting to the golf course. When he arrived the staff loaded his clubs and him, up and brought him out to our hole where we were getting ready to tee off. The course itself is pretty forgiving. Pretty open in the front 9, little tighter on the back. I recommend the Friday Night Fish Fry as well. They have a great dinner and golf special.",positive
"11:30 tee time, finally hit the first tee at 12:15. Followed with almost a six hour round of golf. Not a marshal in site to speed up play. Our group waited almost half an hour just to tee off on a par three. I've been to this course quite a few times over the past couple of years. It is a nice layout and usually in good shape, however after today, never again. Having a good round of golf is all about establishing a rhythm. You will never establish that here.",negative
"Silverado sure doesn't feel like a muni. It's a great, fairly easy course that is a lot of fun and not too penalizing. The front 9 has a more traditional layout, while the back 9 plays a little bit like a desert course. By that I mean that you might have to tee off over some scrub, and off the fairway is semi-scrubular. The tee boxes are spread out from hole-to-hole, which is nice because it separates the groups in front of and behind you. I also love starting the round with a shorter par 5, because you can duff a shot right off the bat and still get away with par.",positive
"Booked my tee time here on line with GolfNow. I have two Junior golfers but GolfNow does not offer that option. However at check in every other course I booked this way has given me the junior rate when lower. Not Silverado and it was a $30 per player difference. There was no good reason not to give me the lower rate, so I felt they were basically saying ""screw you"". The guy in the Pro Shop said ""I could have sold it to someone else at the higher rate"" What??? If I called you would have given me the lower rate, so what is the difference? It cost me more to book online? That makes sense...not. As for the course, nothing special and a rather strange layout with long drives at times between tee boxes. Very slow pace of play too. Greens were ok though so I will give them one positive.. After this experience there is no way I will come back here.",negative
"I'm not sure why this course gets such a low rating. This is a fine golf course. It is in excellent condition. The front nine is somewhat boring as it is basically straight out and straight back. The back nine offers a little more challenge and a few more interesting holes. A warning to walkers: The front nine is easily walked, but the back nine is tough as there are VERY long stretches from green to tee. I played it on 11-24-11 in the first group of the day. The greens were pretty slow, but that was probably because there was a heavy dew that morning and the greens were still pretty wet. As they dry out during the day, they probably run a little faster, but will still be just moderate speed greens. It's a straightforward course, with no tricks off the tee. The 10th hole is a sharp dogleg right with a blind tee shot. Other than that, you can see the shot you need to hit from every tee box. The finishing hole is a moderate, downhill Par 3 over water. Beautiful golf hole.",positive
"They sell your e-mail address to spammers! If you reserve your tee time with them online, they will sell your e-mail address to Viagra and penis enhancement spammers. It happened to me. I used a unique e-mail address with them and next thing I know, I start getting spam on that e-mail address. I confronted them about it and they denied it and didn't take any action which makes them worse. The golf facilities are mediocre so don't even bother.",negative
"I don't golf at all but like to ride my bike along the multi-use path from McDonald Drive to Pima. I watch out for the golfers and occasionally have to duck or at least honker down when I hear ""fore"". To me the golf course doesn't look too exciting but then again I don't golf. If I were to golf I would never get past the first hole and take too much time. Others seem to enjoy it and yell when the ball gets close or into the hole. For me riding my bike is far more enjoyable and very scenic with great views of Four Peaks and sunsets behind Camelback. Over the past several years I have collected hundreds of stray golf balls. I save the uniquely marked ones from other golf courses including Silverado but otherwise box the others up. I have offered them to my nephews to sell but there was little interest. I finally found someone who wants them for distribution to a youth organization. Now I can go out and collect more... plus get more exercise which is my primary objective in the first place.",negative
"I'm not much of a golfer. There. That's how I chose to start this review. So take this for what its' worth ... I've played maybe a dozen times, usually public courses in miami/orlando/atlanta. I was in Scottsdale for business and had a day off so I took advantage of this by making a tee time online for 3:15pm on a Friday the night before. 18 holes and cart included was $30. Free tees, and another $25 for rental clubs and I was on my way. I got to play by myself (bonus, because I hate slowing people down ... I mean, I shot 110) and enjoyed this 18 more than any other (except for a course I once played in Orlando with my father, for sentimental reasons). The course was very well kept, much better than any I've played on in Miami or southern LA. First time playing in Arizona was beautiful and amazing to appreciate the contrast between the red clay and green, green fairways. Not much water, but just enough for me to lose 3 balls in it (I lost 9 total, again, I'm not that good). Freeways line the start of the back 9. A little distracting. I think I hit 3 balls into ongoing traffic. Regardless, it only got better from there. Gorgeous 13th and 15th and 16th holes, among the others. Beautiful semi-island par-3 on 18. I played until dark, nailed a 20ft put, almost birdied 3 in a row, and had an awesome time - very memorable - and happy as hell I took the initiative to play 18 on my day off even though its not my sport. I would recommend it. This course was beautiful.",positive
"Always a great selection, staff is always very helpful. I only buy one brand of scubs - Greys Anatomy Signature, they seem to always have it in stock. Though the prices are a bit higher.",positive
"Got a set of scrubs for mothers day as a gift from a friend who didnt give me the receipt. The scrubs didnt fit so I brought them back to scrubs and beyond where he said he purchased them from. The store manager Kim, was rude and not helpful. Stated that because they just had a sale, and he didnt purchase them under a loyalty card member number and I didnt have a receipt, she wouldn't take the scrubs back for a store credit, although they carry the same brands of scrubs! I'll NEVER buy scrubs from here again. A store manager with horrible customer service!!!!!! I'll stick to Scrubtastic from now on!!!!!!!!!!",negative
"I've been here a few times to get scrubs, usually without a problem. But today, I walked in and was not welcomed whatsoever. There was only one other customer. Whatever, maybe they didn't see me. I browse and pick up 5 items and walk to the dressing room. At this point, I'm the only customer there. I look around and no one offers to unlock a room for me. Fortunately I checked and one room was already unlocked so I helped myself and tried on the items. As I walk out, again the two workers behind the desk don't even look up or acknowledge me. Not ""How did those work out for you? Do you need any help?"" At this point I've been there for 25 minutes and no one has spoken to me! I put the scrubs that I WOULD HAVE purchased back on the racks. I'm not giving a store with ZERO customer service my business! Besides, I found them cheaper on Amazon. It's not hard to say hello. Never going back.",negative
"Excellent service! I'm from out of town and I needed a pair of scrubs ASAP! These ladies not only helped me to get here, but when I did they assisted me get the best pair of scrubs on the market! Thank you Kim!!",positive
"I came here last week to buy scrubs for work. The last time I shopped here was about 4 years ago when I was in high school. Anyways, I love the fact that it's on Eastern in a nice plaza that's close to where I live. When I walked in, I was greeted by one of the workers who I think might be training still, but she was very friendly! A little shy, but I know how that feels just starting off. I think she's a great addition to the team there. I was just walking around first because I like to browse first- I knew what color scrubs I needed. I was greeted by a second worker who was wonderful as well. I told her the colors I needed & she showed me the colors in all of the different style pants and tops. I tried almost all of them on and was able to choose the ones I liked. For 2 tops and a pair of bottoms, it was a little over $100 after tax, which I'm okay with. The scrubs are comfortable and fit extremely well. I've bought scrubs before because they were cheaper in price, but quality and fit might not be as nice. Just remember: You get what you pay for!",positive
"I came into this store due to my school's required dress code for the BSN program. When I brought my paperwork for the order form for the school uniform scrubs, the woman working there with long, dark hair pulled into a ponytail seemed to have quite the attitude. She proceeded to grab pairs of scrubs, lab coat and polo for me to try on and tossed them into the fitting room. When I tried those on, I didn't like the fit of those pants she first brought in. So my aunt grabbed a pair that was next to the ones the woman originally had me try on. When those didn't fit, I asked her for a different style and she replied in a very impolite and condescending tone, ""Those shouldn't have been grabbed in the first place."" Then she let out a loud breath and walked off. She was rude all the way through the check out. I'll be glad once I get my scrubs and not have to return here. Oh and orders take FOREVER to come in.",negative
I come here regularly and always buy expensive scrubs. I haven't had a problem until I brought back UNWORN greys anatomy scrub and a women who I presume to be the manager told me she couldn't refund my money because they were worn.. it isn't my problem that when I bought these that they looked worn. They had been sitting in my closet for less than a month.. I did not appreciate being accused of something that I did not do. Definitely going to be taking my business elsewhere.,negative
"4 Stars because of all the other scrub stores I've been to, mainly in California, the scrubs here are pretty expensive. Bought 6 pairs, spent around $380. I know, why did I spend so much? I strongly felt like I needed new scrubs and they had a good selection of Grey Anatomy scrubs. My favorite! Anyway. I was on my way to Target and I saw this store, so I had to stop by! The place was much smaller than I pictured it would be. Lots to choose from but pretty crowded in that sense. Customer service was pretty good. One lady greeted me and asked if I needed her assistance. The other one who rang me up was also kind and answered my questions. There were two dressing rooms, decent size but I wish there were at least four because there were a few others who wanted to use the fitting room. If I do go back, I'll have to check out the shoe section. I didn't have the time. I'll update this review if I do go back.",positive
"You should train your managers to have better customer service. Not even an apology when you failed to do your job. You had my scrub shirt for several months and still didn't have it embroidered! Just said ""if you want i can send it for embroidery."" WHAT THE HECK OF COURSE YOU SHOULD SEND IT CAUSE I PAID FOR IT. I wish i recorded it cause you really didn't apologize. Not even an apologetic look. Your customer service is terrible. Update: Manager called back to apologize and will be shipping me my scrub shirt once it gets back from embroidery. So, i'll change my review from 1 star to 3 star. It was still really a bad experience looking back. I wish people you put charge of facing customers are ones that genuinely want to serve your customers.",negative

"I have been here twice in 2 days! I arrived not wanting to spend 2k on scrubs for my new veterinary clinic! Being the nice person I am I offered to buy 1 set of scrubs and undershirts for my practice employees! I went in apprehensive because I have been looking online for so long! But this older sweet lady came out of no where and did nothing but help me! She snuck up like a ninja and never left my side u til ""we"" made the right selections for my practice! Her name was Tina and she is the manager. She was so helpful. Honestly I left with a catalog and tons of ideas! Today when I came back she was their to help me. Her staff was amazing and I was in and out in no time! I'm happy with my selection. The knowledge of the scrubs they sell helped tremendously! I feel confident in my purchase!! Thanks guys!! I set up a business account and will be back!!!",positive
"I really like the employees here. However, every time I go into the store they never have anything that I am interested in in my size. I end up having to order online. It's a hassle to say the least. Good customer service though.",negative
"Nice selection of scrubs, not a huge store but you can probably find what you need in a pinch. The door alarm/chime is deafening though, and right above your head as you walk in. You can hear it from clear across the parking lot so you have to be ok with bleeding from the ears if you want to shop here.",positive
I really like this store. Everytime I go the ladies are always helpful. The store is well stocked with a lot of choices and sizes.,positive
"My experience here was a nightmare!!! so I started a new job and I am now required to wear scrubs. I came here and has the worst retail experience of my life!!!! Michelle was so rude to me! First, Asked her for recommendations on scrubs and she told me that she's doesn't know and she only works there and and she can't make choices for me... Uhm hello?!? How can you work there and not know anything about what you're selling? Second, I ended up with 4 pairs of scrubs and bill came up to more than $150, she didn't even offer me the coupon! The girl that was standing next to her told her to give the coupon of $20 off (purchases over $100... I think) to me and she claims that she ""forgot"" about it. So me being already aggravated and just wanted to get out of there did not even check the receipt. Got home and checked the receipt and saw that she charged me an extra pair of pants!!!!! I called her and told her that she charged me an extra pair of pants and she her answer was ""if you want your money back, you have to come back to the store"". Wow just wow! What a nightmare!!!! I hope her management sees this. She deserves a disciplinary action!",negative
"Because of my employer I have to buy my scrubs here. I don't know if my scrub orders take forever because my company is paying for the scrubs or if they just have really shitty slow service. Even if you pay with a gift card your looking at a month to two months wait time to get your stuff. It's even more annoying when you finally get the call that your scrubs are in but when you go to pick it up, the jacket you ordered still hasn't arrived! Wth!?! Why call me when the order isn't completed!! At least let me know so I can decided if I want to make the trip. This place is such an inconvenience",negative
"Pretty small medical supply place, but they carry a pretty good selection of scrubs! Even though I am only allowed to wear black and white scrubs, I saw lots of different designs and plenty of different colors to choose from. What I really like to is that they have pants for the shorter people, like myself. Prices range from $20 - $40 on the scrubs tops or pants, I'd say that's pretty pricey.",negative
"New manager Ashley is unprofessional and RUDE! After THEY messed up on an order I went in to check status of the order and she was very rude advising me that they send items for embroidery on Tuesdays (no one mentioned that before and as a customer, how am I supposed to know that) I told her I did not appreciate the attitude, she said she had attitude because I had one first (waving her finger as she spoke) although I'm not the one getting paid to provide good customer I explained that I simply asked a question, and that the first time we placed our order it took 4 months to get the order right (there was a change in management @ that time as well) This is our 2nd large order. She continued to repeat that ""well we send orders out on Tuesdays"" I informed her that I am also in customer service and regardless of the tone or attitude I am given I don't let that affect the way I respond. I advise her I would call corporate, her response ""good so will I"" with a smirk. We are paying customers that will take our large office orders elsewhere next time. Location won't matter, customer service will!",negative
"This store is in a good location, in the Target shopping center. They have a variety of scrubs but they are lacking in the popular brands of scrubs. Most of mine had to be ordered. The staff seemed courteous in the beginning but after a while they seemed annoyed with my questions. The girl placing my order on the computer moved slow and stopped to huff and puff every so often making it take even longer. Next time I will order online thru a different store and save myself the frustration.",negative
"I hate shopping for scrubs. They are my least favorite thing to shop for. I'd much rather be spending my money on purses or nice shoes or regular clothing. But alas, I wouldn't be able to afford any of those things if I didn't buy scrubs for work and bring home the bacon. So since we've established that I don't have a choice in the matter, if I have to buy scrubs this isn't a bad place to go for them. The service is excellent for a scrub shop. The store is very well organized and there's a nice selection of brands. Sometimes finding your size in a certain color is difficult but in most cases they can order what you're looking for and you can pick it up in store later on. Make sure you tell them which hospital you work in because, chances are, you'll get some sort of a discount. This is the place my department uses for our scrub credits (we get a $50 credit here to buy our assigned colors. Anyone that knows scrubs knows that doesn't go very far. So the extra 10% off helps.) I think I'll be back here more often, especially since I'm pretty sure life uniform in Whitney Ranch is closed...",positive
"I went to the scrub store to gets scrubs for my tanning business ... I had the sweetest sales person, Vera. She was very helpful with my purchase. I wanted to get them monogrammed because I was going on tv and wanted the advertisement on my back while facing away from the camera. I did not have a great deal of time to prepare for this so this was July 3rd, the day before a holiday ! Abby the manager I believe was so gracious to take my scrubs to the Embroider place and wait to have them done the same day and called me and I had them by 8 pm the SAME DAY !! These girls knew that I was in a tight jam and went out of their way to help me out and make sure that I was taken care of !! I would highly recommend them to anyone looking for a uniform, you dont have to be a nurse to rock Scrubs baby !!!",positive
"Every time I've been here, the staff has been extremely helpful and always willing to help me with sizing and explaining different brands & materials. They have a pretty sizable selection; however, I find they are always limited on sizes. I'm a petite S or M, and I have a difficult time finding my size in the scrubs I like. Usually, the sizes they have on the racks are the only sizes available. The staff is always willing to order the correct size for me, but I'm an instant gratification kind of gal. Also, they are a bit pricey. I've found the exact same scrubs online for more competitive pricing, but like I said, I don't like waiting so I'd just rather pay a bit more for the item right away then wait for online shopping. :p I also like that they offer a discount depending on the hospital you work for or if you're a student. That's definitely helpful! The real reason I keep coming back to Scrubs & Beyond is the staff. I've always had exceptional customer service here, and that's enough for my patronage.",negative
"Friendly staff, eager to help you. This was my first experience trying on scrubs so I needed to figure out what looked best on me. I was helped while in the dressing room by them bringing me additional sizes. I had a good experience here and the selection was nice as well!",positive
"The only reason why I went here was because I got a 30% coupon at school during the Nursing Appreciation Week. I usually go to the scrub store near Russell Road. This is was my second HORRIBLE visit. This blonde girl(chubby or preggers) that works there has a very bad attitude. I was hesitant to walk in but it was the last day to make the purchase using the coupon. Let me just tell you that she wasn't very accomodating. Why bother working if you're going to drive customers away? If retail isn't your forte, DON'T WORK because it makes people like me mad at your kind. I would have bought at least $200 worth of shoes and scrubs but instead, her little attitude made me not want to spend money there. Sorry, that's just the way it is..",negative

"This has got to be the all time worst Sears when it comes to Customer Service. We were in the other day trying to exchange some items. We had the receipt and everything still had the tags on it. We were told by the Clerk we could not exchange the items because they were purchased over 30 days ago. We then spoke with the Store Manager & General Manager who both responded that we were just out of luck and walked away. We have called the Customer Service line and sent emails. To each one the response has been ""that's our policy so you are just out of luck."" So we are closing our Sears account and will not be shopping there any more!

"Refrigerator delivery & haul away of existing unit, TERRIBLE beyond belief. Not one good thing. Call center made numerous promises to send a 4 man team - TWICE ONLY SENT 2 MEN. The subcontractor delivery service, Inovelle, rude & lazy. Sad & disappointing would not recommend them or any company that subcontracts delivery of appliances.",negative
"Holy hell this store is pathetic. Today I spent an hour shopping here. Lots of stuff on sale and prices I was willing to pay. While trying to confirm sale prices and clearance prices you figure out quickly none of their price scanners work. So you know what? I might buy more if some things are cheaper than they're marked .. but since I can't tell, I don't pick up other items. Then I go get in line to pay. I wait right next to the ""Line Forms Here"" sign. I got to stand there and watch a cashier argue with a customer over something (I have no opinion of who was right as I didn't really listen). She calls over her manager who also starts to argue. He actually said to the customer ""Well I guess I'll wait till you stop talking so I can get a word in edgewise."" and a few other rude comments. I swear to you if you ever say that to me while I'm trying to ask you something I will throw all the merchandise literally right in your face. The other cashier was taking forever to ring the customers before me up. Finally another woman comes over (a large woman wearing only a tank top - I don't need to see that much of your employees skin). She tells the cashier she can't use that register because ""it doesn't know what day it is"". So they cancel the transaction and move to another register wasting more of my time. At this point the arguers leave. The cashier turns around and looks at me in line, then turns back and starts putting unwanted merchandise on carts to go back to the floor. I wait again. While she's doing this another woman walked up to her register and she immediately began ringing her up knowing full well I was standing in line. At this point I threw my 4 items on a table and walked out. If you're wondering why your stores are doing so poorly and you're all going to be unemployed soon, this is exactly the reason. Dirty stores. Merchandise all over the damn place. Useless employees. And marginal quality inventory. You will deserve what you get. ~~~~~~~~~ Edited to add: You notice that not a single negative review has a reply from their management? Or their regional management? Because they don't care AT ALL about their customers. Also, if you try to send in a complaint on their ""feedback"" section of their website it has a question which requires an answer - except the page doesn't give you a box to input an answer - and guess what? You can't submit your feedback unless that question is answered. Well played Sears, well played. You can't fix what you claim to not know about, right? Too bad you're playing yourselves into bankruptcy and unemployment.",negative
"I love coming here and getting amazing deals (here as in Sears in general, not this specific location). The Sears back home doesn't have the certain shirts I liked, no matter the location. I had time to kill before my flight back home, and decided the hit up the mall which this Sears was attached to. I took a look and they had the flannels I was looking for and at half price (44$ to 22$). I bought a few of them and went to the counter, the price was even lower (they ended up being 17.65$) each instead which was fantastic! And the icing on the top? They didn't ask me stupid questions like what's my phone number and other dumb ass questions like that. Overall, a beautiful experience and great location. Would highly recommend. And to those saying the mall itself is ghetto, I really don't think so. But that will get addressed in my review of the mall itself.",positive
"A solid store for shopping either in store or online! I like the fact that they will price match their online prices, unlike their sister store Kmart. That makes things so convenient if you're like me and consistently scanning items with your phone like you work there just to make sure your getting the best deal! If you shop here you absolutely need to sign up to be a shop your way rewards member! It is their free rewards program! You get coupons almost daily that makes shopping here almost a chore, because you never want to miss out on a deal! For you latecomers there's a new perk. The Picture People photo store is now located in Sears, this means you can now accumulate points from your photo visits!",positive
"We will never buy another appliance from Sears! Their Appliance Service department is the world's worst! The techs are not trained to service a LG front loader washer, numerous, numerous trips and finally Sears replaced the washer. Yesterday I had a preventive maintenance appointment on the replacement and they cancelled the appointment.",negative
"Do not lose your receipt, if you do you will be screwed. They will tell you to swipe the card you used for the transaction and ""see if it reads it"" well it didn't. Less then one week after purchase. And that's it, no store credit available for a brand new set of pots with the sears sticker that they put on for bigger items to get out the store still on it. I used to love sears but will never go to another one again until they change their return policy back to the way it used to be. Can see why they will be out of business soon. On a side note I returned a 2 yr old dyson vacuum to Costco the next day with no receipt, got a brand new one... it was pretty awesome, reaffirmed my feeling for how sears values their customers....",negative
"This location behaves like a stereotypical car repair place. they would not repair my car without doing a $90 diagnostic, even though I know what's wrong with my car. How do I know? Sears technicians told me what was wrong four months ago when they ran the diagnostic, which I paid for at that time! My sears location in California is great, but I immediately felt like I was dealing with hustlers at this location.",negative
"BEWARE! If you order from Sears, they have a hard and fast 30 day return policy. You need to change, Sears. I anyone needs a 30"" microwave trim kit...I have one they won't take back after 34 days",negative
Every single time I come in to the jewelry department there is only ONE worker and there is ALWAYS a line. All I came to do today was pick up earrings that had to be repaired. As usual there was one worker and she was already helping another customer. The customer was indecisive about what watch she wanted to purchase so I knew it was going to be a long wait and then when she finally decided on a watch the checkout process is taking FOREVER. She is STILL trying to check out the other customer as I am typing this and it's been no joke TWENTY minutes already. It's not their fault that customers are indecisive or want to split the payment on different cards which apparently makes the transaction complicated but it is their fault that they ALWAYS only have one person working the jewelry department. ALL I NEED IS TO PICK UP MY EARRINGS!!!! That will take what a whole 2 minutes?? Omg and she's still not done checking her out! Who takes over 20 minutes to process a watch purchase??? Ugh hate this about them!!!,negative
"The return policy of 30 days is incredibly stupid. I bought my son some clothes for his birthday, you know I was thinking ahead. When to return them 32 days later and the rude ""manager"" was snotty and said that the ""policy"" is 30 days and that they couldn't return them. I will NEVER shop at Sears or Kmart again due to this policy. When I mentioned to the cashier about buying gifts for Christmas, I was told that they change the policy in December to 45 days. They make concessions for the holiday season, but not for the entire year. I then went to Penney's and their return policy is 45 days. So long to Sears and their affiliates. I am tired of the customers being treated like second hand citizens. I can't wait until they go out of business due to cruddy customer service.",negative
"Worst experience ever...bought a $1500.00 tv that went bad after 35 days, but because it pass the 30 days policy she will not exchange it....will not buy from that store ever...the manager Natasha will not help in any way, after I've seen transactions override many times... They are more worried about their sales than the customers ....",negative
"Don't shop at any Sears, even online, if you're buying appliances or anything that might need installation or service. In a few short years, the CEO and board have turned a corporation that was a flagship of American retailing into a company that cannot be trusted. Their internal corporate communication is so poor that I got five different answers in one day as to whether an item that had been scheduled for installation would installed and at what period of day. It was not installed as requested because the company to which installation was outsourced (Sears used to do all their own installations) never received any kind of work order and wasn't capabable of installing the equipment as needed. The company refused to honor their product or installation guarantee or even to remove equipment that their poor installation had rendered unusable. After paying over $700 total for an $400 piece of equipment because I wanted it installed correctly, I had to pay $200 to have it hauled away. It was not used once. The CEO and board should go to hell for what they've done to this once excellent corporation for the sake of short-term products. I refuse to buy anything there, even a bottle of water, because of the poor treatment and FALSE satisfaction guarantees. I've heard similar comments from other consumers. Go to hell, Sears.",negative
"I have been coming to this Sears location for years and really have very few complaints. I usually know what I am looking for when I stop by or it's to pick up an online order. When I have an order to pick up, I just go to the designated area and if you know where the doors for the mall food court entrance are...head to that part of the parking lot and you will see doors with a sign for Sears saying customer merchandise pick up and they even have designated parking for those customers. Once inside I simply enter my info and then within minutes someone brings out my order. I do this often when I see a good deal online and don't want to deal with looking for it in the store and then waiting in line to buy it. You can also earn points with every purchase as part of their rewards program if you order online or purchase in the store to redeem for stuff. I recently came by on Black Friday and when I saw how many people there was inside shopping and how long (I mean loooongggg) the lines were, I wondered how bad the experience was going to be. Well, it wasn't bad! I looked through the area with the small kitchen appliances and other home goods and wasn't impressed at all. The area where the tools are was however spacious and they had plenty of employees on hand to assist. I was able to find amazing deals on some Christmas gifts for my hubby and even though the line looked horrendous it went pretty quick and they had every register (smart on Black Friday) open. I wish some of the other departments were bigger like other Sears locations, but the mowers and tools I have purchased here have been of quality and most of the Craftsman stuff has a warranty and I haven't had issues with getting certain things replaced. They don't refill chalk boxes (lines) free anymore and most measuring tape has restrictions, so keep that in mind for those of you that were used to getting those filled/replaced for free in the past.",positive
"I like this Sears better than the Boulevard Mall location, maybe because it's newer, the automotive department is close by, and the children's department (which is facing the entrance doors, so you can see outside of the store) doesn't feel like you're deep in a dungeon (the blvd. mall's sears' lower level is in the basement). Upper level has children's, home/linens, while the lower level has womens, juniors, swimwear, jewelry, and shoes. The cashier desk is at the children's department. I like the children's department (this location doesn't have as much baby care equipment as the Blvd. Mall store, unless I missed it, and it's in another section) because we usually find something for our little guy here: lots of disney and other cartoon-character themed clothing, as well as Carters, and affordable mix & match tops & bottoms, Toughskins clothing available in all sizes for toddlers and young children (Sears brand). The elevator is near the home/linens on the upper level, while on the lower level, it is near the shoe department. Yesterday was a Friends & Family event with an additional 20% off prices (coinciding with the ""Back To School"" rush in the mall, which was jam-packed), not including clearance items. We had been here the week before (there were quite a few markdowns in the children's department), and went back to the shoe department to see if our son's size was available (we recently went over his wardrobe and shoes, and learned that his feet grew out of many of his shoes!); luckily, we found a pair of Joe Boxer slip-on canvas shoes. Lots of benches to try on shoes, but someone left five pairs there, so I scooted them over to one side. I noticed that the swimwear was marked down to $9.99. A very long line at the main cashier on the lower level, so my husband checked with the jewelry department to see if he could pay for the shoes there; luckily, they said yes. There were more customers here during the ""Back To School"" rush, but it wasn't crowded. Besides the children's shoes stacking up on one bench, the store was pretty much orderly.",positive
"do not buy any kenmore kitchen appliances from this place i have not had my range or microwave even 90 days and had the repair people come out 3 times already i am too done and each time they keep saying it just needs adjusting and the sad part is on the consumer affairs report everyone that has purchased kenmore ranges and microwaves have the same complaint....either it burns up your food or undercook your food and does not bake evenly, as for the microwaves what normally would take 2 minutes takes up to 6 minutes to heat up.....their salesmen will lie to you about how good the kenmore product is ....don't listen there is well over 300 plus complaints.",negative
"Placed an order online that required in-store pick up. Arrived the next day at Merchandise Pick Up and entered order info in kiosk computer. Nothing. We are informed that the item is a floor model and hasn't been pulled yet. We walk back to electronics and find it. The salesperson unplugs it and we are thinking we are done. That would make way too much sense. Since we ordered and paid online for this exact unit, we must wait until it is ready for delivery. WTF? It is sitting right here. If we want to take it before the Sears computer in the sky deems that it is ready (maybe later in the afternoon), then we will need to pay for it again, and this time no warranty. Again, WTF? We are informed that Sears and Sears Online are different entities. Your issue, not ours. Here we were holding the item, with an online receipt, ready to leave, but it was not good enough. Manager intervention, frustrating explanations of the obvious, time wasted on something very simple. Does it have to be so hard? Sears is dying for a reason. Customer service in America is dead.",negative
"This store is closer to where I live, so it's convenient to come here . But whether I'm on the phone with them, or in the store the staff is not friendly at all, and if I want to be transferred to a certain department to ask them a simple question about printers, I'm transferred like 8 times - seriously . So I will go out of my way to another Sears for better customer service skills .",negative

"DO NOT BUY ANY APPLIANCE FROM SEARS, they sold us a damaged water heater! ! It's been 3 days without hot water, we were going to install the new one last night when we opened the box it came in and realized it was dented. They didn't even pack it in foam or anything, the box pretty much feel apart when we tried closing it again so we can take it back. This is unprofessional and ghetto and so are the sears workers !!! Also if you do buy anything here, check your shit before they load it into the vehicle or truck and find out how long the return period is because I'm sure as ive read online, it probably won't work properly either. How fucking ridiculous this place is selling damaged NEW appliances and then telling us that we have to wait till they order a new one or drive across town for another one! This should have never happened in the first place !! And don't even get me started on the return process where they run us around from one department to the next because they fucked up! !",negative
"Placed an order on line. Very easy process. Went to the store, walked up to a checkout counter and asked the girl where merchandise pick-up was located. Lucky us, it was right around the corner! Went to pick-up area, entered my info into machine, and someone brought my merchandise out within 3 minutes! It couldn't have been easier!",positive
"I needed to get some new appliances and went to this store. Sears has excellent service on appliances so I was motivated to buy. Joe, the salesman, greeted me immediately and provided a no pressure presentation of the options available. Of course he pitched the Kenmore products but explained the features on the variety of manufacturers, their warranties and discounts and gave a comparative analysis. I have shopped at this Sears store for many years and find that it has great retail service and on hand merchandise.",positive
Do not order to pick up merchandise here. They are very unorganized and slow at this location. You're better off driving 30 minutes out to a different location.,negative
"I bought a dishwasher at the Sears online store and changed my mind after I paid for it with paypal. They told me that the sale was still pending and I needed to wait another 24 hours before I could cancel it. I called back the next day and canceled. This has been over a week and I still haven't gotten my money back. Sears has held onto close to 400.00 of mine and it appears that I'm going to have to fight to get it back. I submitted a dispute with paypal, (which will take 10 days for me to get my money) and also have spoken to countless people regarding my refund. Most of the phone numbers don't answer and personally, I will never do business with Sears again. I really couldn't afford to have this mix up with 400.00 for a couple of weeks. Sears is supposed to be a reputable company, but apparently they are doing so poorly, they hope you don't notice that they haven' given you a refund.",negative
I came here on Black Friday to get some of the items listed on their cover ad for the big sale. When I got there is was complete chaos. They did not have any of the items that were being advertised for Black Friday and refused to place orders and the sale price. I waited in line for 2 hours to purchase another version of the item I originally went to just to listen to every single customer complaining about something that the store was mis-advertising or refusing services for. When I finally got to the check out line the lady rang my item up as pick up instead of take out. So I watched them take my item away from me so I had to pull around back and wait in yet another long line of complaints from customers receiving the wrong item or not receiving their item at all. I had my item in my hand but had to wait to pick it up!! Not to mention that when I first arrived at the store I asked a salesperson about the item I was looking for to which he gave me some nonsense answer. I will definitely not be returning here.,negative
"Argh! Thought I could get some simple tires put on my car at this location. Not a chance! They took forever and now the car shakes going down the road.

"Took my wife in as a lark, to maybe find a wedding dress for a reasonable price. She was looking for a simple country style and had never been in the store before. Let me tell you we were BLOWN away from the vast selection of boots and awesome attire. Very clean, and Courtney was so nice. She helped us find a PERFECT dress, and it came out to be just 30 dollars! We came in expecting nothing and they gave us the world. Thanks Courtney!",positive
My husband and found a 20 percent off coupon in one of the Vegas at our hotel. We were in need of certain items for a costume I'm putting together for him. The young lady who helped us was so friendly and helpful. I told here what I needed and we ended up with a couple of items. Very nice store and had great service.,positive
"It's good thing I don't like a lot of sales support when shopping for footwear because no one shopping here got any! Cashier also brusquely informed me that the boots he was ringing up for me ""didn't match"" without telling me why (I had a left one and a right one in the same size) and stalked away to find some that did. He substituted one of them and clucked loudly when I asked if I could try them on again and stalked back to the register, where I caught up with him to pay for my Ariats, he asked for the ""last 4 numbers on the front of"" the card he'd just had in his hand, again without telling me why. It's also a good thing I know how to check credit card transactions. This was my second purchase there under less than ideal service circumstances. No charm, no third time.",negative
"I was visiting from Calgary and looking for cowboy boots for Stampede and found a great deal on boots and a belt at Sheplers. I went to Pinto the day before and although they were nice, I wasn't looking to spend $600 on boots! I also went to Boot Star and although they had cool boots there, the staff never said anything and it made my mother and I feel really uncomfortable so we walked out. So when we went to Sheplers the next day we were relieved to find a comfortable atmosphere, reasonable priced items and the staff were incredibly nice and helpful. 5 stars for the staff! The only reason I took a star off is because the women's section of boots didn't have as many options as the mens, but they also said that was because there wasn't as large of demand.",positive
"Fun store! Lots of shoes, country/western wear, hats, belts, etc. I ended up buying a pair of ATS red boots that I've had for a month now, and I still get compliments on every time I wear them out!",positive
"First off, there are a few things about me that may make this review more relevant. While I have lived in Las Vegas for close to fifteen years, I'm an original downhome Texas girl. I'm an avid fan of country music. I attend Cowboy Christmas EVERY SINGLE YEAR, which is where my father pointed out a cowboy hat he would be interested in for Christmas. Fast forward a few weeks and he drops the subtle hint (with a coupon) where I can find this particular cowboy hat. So, I go to the Sheplers at this location. There, I asked the young man working at the cowboy hat section about the style that I wanted in a size 7. He pointed out my wrist tattoo, bantered with me about professional and collegiate football teams and several other things before he informed me that the hat I wanted in that size was out of stock. My sister asked if there was another location and when he confirmed that there was, she requested that he call and inquire about the hat we wanted in a size 7. A few moments later, he came back and smugly informed us that they had that hat and that he had asked for them to put it on hold. The other location is inconveniently located inside Sam's Town on Boulder Highway. And...once I made the trip out there, I not only discovered that he gave them the wrong hat style, but requested for them to hold a size 7 1/8. I appreciate that you thought my shopping experience would have been made better by the banter that I didn't need, but I would have preferred to not waste my time traveling across town for nothing rather than you know my favorite football team. Try listening to the next customer's PURCHASE next time.",negative
"Fun store if you're a cowboy/girl. Big selection of wrangler's, MissMe, BootyUp, and monster selection of boots. Not many bargains except for the clearance racks. Helpful friendly staff.",positive
"I'm a little bit country (I can sing along to ""Country Boy Can Survive""), and Shepler's is a whole lotta country. While I don't stock my wardrobe here, I do enjoy swinging by from time to time just to inhale the smell of fine boot leather. Things I appreciate: 1. You can hum along to country tunes. 2. Exceptional customer service that stands behind their products. We were able to swap a faulty pair of boots we had purchased in Denver with no hassle! 3. Unexpected bargains on unique pieces. You can find some men's shirts on sale that you won't see everywhere else. 4. Boots! I have yet to purchase a pair for myself, but boy do I love browsing (and smelling). For everything country, this is my spot.",positive
Great selection of shoes not usually found in other stores. Excellent customer service. My daughter found her bridal shoes there when we stopped in on a whim.,positive
I came in here tonight just to look around and I found two pairs of boots that I really liked and a pair of mermaid sparkly heels I ended up getting one pair of boots and the sparkly heels I didn't want to bring them back up to my room so they held onto the booth and the shoes after I paid for it they were very nice Elizabeth and linda and tell me I can pick them up in the morning I have been shopping at the store for years,positive
"I always like visiting Shooz (in Paris hotel) when in Vegas! They have a small but cool collection of accessories. This time, my mother found in the store sandals she liked. They didn't have her size, so they called around until they found another store on the Strip that carried the exact sandals in her size. They assured her that the other store (Paradiso at MGM) would hold the sandals for her till 8 PM the next day, which is indeed what they've done. Great customers service, thank you!",positive
Great selection of really trendy european styles. The staff is really nice and was very patient as i tried on atleast 8 pairs before selecting the one. And did i mention Great Prices. A must visit shop at the Paris!!! :),positive
Rooms are old. Bath tub is plugged. We don't like it. Not coming here again. Btw restaurants are expensive! Air con doesn't work well. Going back to Ballys!,negative
Never miss a chance to go to Shooz when in Vegas -- We stay at Paris most often and I have never been disappointed in my purchases. Helpful staff -- and reasonable prices. Thank you!,positive
"I always shop here when I am in Vegas. This pass week while there EJ really took good care of me and my colleagues from Atlanta, great shoe store and great prices. Thank you EJ for outstanding customer service!",positive
i love this store i wish that i had one closer to the home or be able to shop on the net. the shoes-sunglasses-hat-belts are wonderful. the staff is very helpful. i lost a pair of sunglasses and they are assisting me to find a second pair that i loved,positive
"Small store inside Paris, but they have a decent selection of a little bit of everything from sandals to club shoes to pumps. What I also appreciate is that they carry the Foot Petals foot cushions which make shoes way more comfortable!",positive
"Beautiful store and a wonderful staff! I'm not a shy person, but if I were, the ladies here would know how to put me at ease. The store is so pretty and they have a healthy selection of lingerie, but I go for the toys! I highly recommend this place to anyone visiting Las Vegas AND the vegas natives. Don't be afraid - It's worth the trip!",positive
Seriously such a great place! Way better selection of lingerie than any other place in Vegas and great prices. I had such a good experience with the help of Tenvya (I hope I spelled her name correct). I will definitely be back eapecially after seeing all the sales on my way out!,positive
"I appreciate the intimate vibe I got from this store. They do have a lot of the same products you would find at a bigger venue, but without that overwhelming feeling. Went to a grand opening event yesterday which included models, music, and munchies. We liked an outfit that one of the models had on so much we had to get it. The model even helped wifey put it on properly. Unfortunately with boutiques quantities are sometimes limited especially in certain sizes. Overall I definitely would recommend this place over the larger non personal stores scattered around Vegas.",positive
"Classy and elegant store with a bit of naughty! Whether it be apparel, soaps and oils, or ""massagers"", you will not be able to resist. The sales crew is amazing!",positive
"Sinsations is easily my new favorite adult store. They offer a vast selection of toys and erotic play for both men and women. Hands down, Sinsations is the most friendly, upscale, and tasteful, boutique in Vegas. The staff is friendly and genuinely happy to help, which makes for an awesome and memorable shopping experience. Finally, I have to mention the clothing and lingerie, sinsations offers a unique, and truly original, line of sexy woman's wear that will make any evening sinsational!!",positive
"So when I first walked in I noticed they had some super cute clothing, the girls there were so sweet and knowledgeable, & the toy prices were cheaper than the place I usually go so that's always a plus!",positive
"After confirming via email, I brought in a jacket with a missing fur pom-pom to have it replaced. Over email, they said it can be done through the manufacturer, no problem, I would just have to bring it in. I found out that having the coat received was no quick task. It wasn't just a matter of dropping it off and filling out some form. The middle-aged man who I dropped it off with, whom I assume to be a supervisor, sorta disappeared for AT LEAST 20-30mins. I have no idea where he went with the coat. He came back and muttered something about having to find some kinda serial/model #. He wasn't very friendly, just had a deadpan demeanor. Very little communication as to where he was going, what he was doing, etc. Weeks later, I receive a voicemail, saying that my coat was ready. It was a strange vm, no name, like 1min of complete silence before he actually started recording his message. Anyway, I pop in at my earliest convenience, and a cashier took my receipt, and was gone for a very long time, at least 20mins. She said that my coat wasn't there and that it should take 8-12 weeks - not 3 or how ever long I've been waiting. She was very nice and apologetic, but I did express my disappointment at the mixup. A complete waste of my time, driving out of my way, waiting for nothing. Again, initial man who served me NEVER verbalised that replacement would take this long. Would've been nice to know ahead of time as the coat is currently in-season. By the time I get it, it'll probably be close to Spring and I'll have no need for it! I'm guessing that someone called me by accident. Although this place LOOKS nice, fancy, & is new, they're very disorganised, possibly mismanaged. Every time I'm there, they seem extremely overstaffed, just a bunch of workers loitering around, chatting with each other, looking bored when there are no customers. Will update AFTER I receive my coat back.",negative
"I have bought a lot of gear here. Mountain bikes, snowboards, skiis and outdoor clothing are all well valued here. I don't buy any non technical clothing here though. That's too rich. Lol. I have used their Lifeline for receipts and warranty service. They did misplace many of my past purchases but a manager sorted that out for me. Now my history is all on record again. I usually only buy stuff on sale here even if it's off season as I'm not really an impulse buyer. I want quality AND value. I find the knowledge and attention of the staff very good and when they don't know something they find out from someone who does. I love their half back program for kids ski equipment. Watch out for sales in store - it's VERY busy.",positive
"Looking for a very nice jacket? This is the place to be. You can try many expensive jacket without the feeling of salesman eyeing you for commission. They sell the top seller jackets such as Canada goose, Mackage, Woolrich, Marc New York, etc. They also have a variety of goodies such as snowboard/ski equipment, shoes, and athletic gears. Some are at a reasonable price and some at a very unreasonable price. You may have to be a very savvy shopper. Despite of this their return policy is top notch. Not happy or have regrets? Return it right away. Just ensure its not been used and original are still on. The staff has a very friendly approach and will help you find what you need. They work fast and efficient and getting me out of there quick in a Boxing Day chaos. Definitely, will be back to check out more sales in this store.",positive
"Impossibly unprofessional service at the Nike cash inside this store. Eye rolling at the customer in front of us, then without skipping a beat right after they depart ""oh my fucking god"" out loud and laughing about how ridiculous the other customer was with the other cashier. When we finished our transaction she threw the bag across the counter at us and walked away. :/",negative
"THIS IS FOR THEIR ONLINE SITE OH MY GOSH. I ordered 4 items on January 1 and it is now January 30. Three of the items ordered were ""out of stock"" and I was notified on Jan. 9, 10, and 11 respectively. Apparently they are shipping the fourth item out as of January 11, when the UPS shipping label was created. After two weeks of wondering where this item is -- and constant emails (as they do not answer their phone through the 1-800 line...), I am now told that the ""item was returned from the shipping facility to the store"". My credit card was charged on January 9. Yes, for something that will probably never arrive... They do apologize (which is better than the review below that also gave them one-star), but they are pretty darned inept!!!! The solution? They offered me a 10% discount on my next regular priced order. Geez, thanks! Will there be another order? Definitely not....",negative
"I had a really bad experience trying to return a Canada Goose coat here. It was in perfect condition and the salesperson made me feel really bad for returning it. I have never been treated so badly in a retail store and will never go back. This is the first review I've written like this, but it is well deserved, trust me!",negative
"The salesperson that helped us today was Stephan and he was great. Unfortunately when we got to the check-out, we received mediocre service from a man who appeared to be the manager that day. He grew impatient when it turned out that my second gift card had a problem (while the first gift card worked). He requested to see my ID in a distrusting tone and then also suggested in a condescending tone to pay the balance with another form of payment and come back when I get my gift card sorted out. However, I did not see a line-up at the cash registers as there were several cashiers to serve customers. This has left me with a bad impression of the store and I will reconsider buying from this store again when I purchase my next $800+ coat.",negative
"I was turned off completely by visiting retailers for ski/snowboard gear, but Descente's website said to visit Sporting Life.... so FINE. FINEEEEEEEEEEE And right when I walked in, I was so happy to see SO many brands and many modern/up-to-date styles for outdoor clothing! Did I see a Spyder jacket in size XS, and did I see two? Did I see reasonable prices (given this is really what you'd pay for anyways....)? YES. and yes! And yes I walked out with some sexy tight-fitting Spyder snowpants. I was able to pick between size 4 and 6! If it's not available in my size, the staff offers to call the Yonge location and send one over. Which they did. It was as short as ONE DAY for delivery, so I was able to try on my jacket quite soon! I did not feel pressured to buy anything. Really liked the staff here! Except probably the cashier ladies.",positive
Great place for a bike tune up. Had to bring my refurbed bike in after my last one got stolen (which had just been tuned up here too!). Spoke with Asa both times and he's super helpful and attentive. Definitely suggest these guys to anyone inquiring. Good pricing too! A tune up starts at $60 and other local shops I've looked at we're $100+,positive
Sagi ( sorry if the spelling is incorrect) helped us out this morning & was fantastic. He seems to live his job& made my 17 year old daughter feel like a princess. Will be back to see him due to the impeccable attention & service.,positive
"I went in this store to simply browse and in less than 10 minutes I was in a dressing room with dresses hand picked for me. Ricardo was perfect and on point with his selections. After getting back to our room eager to wear it for our night out I noticed a hole in the hip area through the sheer fabric. Unaware if I was at fault for this during trying it on snagging it in the hotel room or what not, I reluctantly went back in to Stash to ask about the exchange policy. They happily agreed and shipped out a replacement. Spending 250.00 on a dress with this kind of service is definitely worth it. They have earned a loyal and return customer for sure!",positive
"the staff here rocks! funny, sweet and they will tell you what looks good and what does not. I bought a gold bandage dress that made me feel like a million bucks. so instead of spending 1k on an herve leger i spent 250 and got an amazing dress that fits like a glove.",positive
"Still lovin' this store, as it still has lots of funky clothes (especially dresses, and bling jewelry!), and the lady who works here is lovely (I think her name is Belle. Long red hair. Super super nice!). And the dressing rooms are fantastic, large, with upholstered plush chairs for folks to hang with you as you try on clothes, and thick velvet curtain ""doors"". Very dramatic and fun! My only issue is, on my last visit here, I fell in love with a black tank top with a bling gold perfume bottle emblazoned on the front. It didn't work for me (unfortunately). But later that day I saw the exact same top in another store in this Miracle Mile complex for nearly $20 less! Wow, that's a substantial difference. So I'll be more wary of pricing here on future visits.",positive
"You know what makes a clothing store stand out from the rest? superb customer service: staff who who not only welcome you, but pick out clothing for you! I found this store because of all of their great Yelp reviews. Not only did I buy a great outfit, but I also got a friend to buy a great outfit as well! I will definitely come back on my next trip to Vegas!",positive
Came in to buy clothes for a night out with the boys at the club. The selection was great and the customer service was through the roof! They turned the miserable experience of buying clothes into something that I could actually look forward to again. I'll be back soon to shop more!,positive
"Inside Planet Hollywood, if you are looking for the not so ordinary this is the place. Ricardo was the best. I was undecided about which awesomeness to purchase for my evening event. They have so many to choose from. Jewels, lace or tulle you will not be disappointed. After much discussion and a whole heap of mind blowing conversation about which dress would fit my figure, I walled out completely satisfied. The dress can be special ordered and in store within 4 business days. I am so excited! Thank you for your expertise, Ricardo!",positive
"I came to Vegas on vacation with no plan to purchase a dress even though I would be needing one soon for the Marine Corps Ball. Not only did I find a fantastic dress at a good price, but Ricardo was a very friendly, helpful employee. He sold me on the dress without being annoying or pushy. I am actually amazed there is a bad review about him at all. If I lived near by I would definitely shop here more often and want his help each time. Overall it is a great store with great employees! :) I highly recommend it!",positive
"I went to this store for alterations to jeans that my husband and I had purchased. This place was recommended to us. When we arrived, we were completely ignored by one of the salespeople. The two other sales people were better, but one was giving advice to a woman telling her something looked great on her when it clearly did not. When the alterations woman approached me, she was very gruff and bent over asking me lazily if where I rolled my jeans was where I wanted the hem. ??? I asked how much the charge would be and she said $30! We were told $15 before going... I'm not paying that for a simple hem. As we walked out, one of the sales people asked me why I was leaving. I told him we were misquoted. He said the charge is supposed to be $25. I told him the alterations woman told me $30... All around terrible experience. This is the type of place that has sales people that will kiss your butt if you have an alternative lifestyle, but if you're married with children, forget it.",negative
"I fell on this store by accident. I was across the way, spilled coffee on myself and went to Stash to grab a top. They have amazing jeans, super cute tanks and the best sales people! The guy actually gave me the shirt they had on hold since he said ""the previous woman was so rude you deserve it"":) The best selection of Rock & Republic jeans I have ever seen!",positive
"My mother in law swore up and down that these are the best shoes for babies and toddlers and she was 100% correct! My son only owns 1 pair of shoes that aren't Stride Rite and that's only because my husband insisted that he have a pair of Jordan's. Anywho, they always have a good selection of shoes in his size and its never overly crowded. He began walking unassisted at 8.5 months old and it could very well be thanks to Stride Rite. Lastly, Marilyn has been there just about every trip and she is always helpful and extremely kind. I'm thankful for her enthusiasm and helpfulness.",positive
"For the past two years I have been taking my now 3 year old twins in to get their shoes here. The staff are great with the kids! They really care that children leave with shoes that really fit them properly. They even take the time to watch them walk in the shoes to double check their stride and the fit. Shoe buying trips come frequently, but at least the process is easy with these great salespeople.",positive
The ladies working there are amazing. The store manager was very friendly. Lots of patience considering i went with my 4yr old and my 2 yr.,positive
"Be wary of the sizing. I brought my granddaughter in to get a pair of shoes. She is 3 years old and is currently wearing a size 7. The store clerk measured her foot and said she should be wearing an 8.5W. I questioned the difference in size, but she was positive she measured correctly. They didn't have her size in stock so I went home and ordered online. We just got the shoes three days before her 4th birthday and lo and behold the shoes were at least an inch too long. Do you know what it is like to disappoint a little 4 year old who had her heart set on the cinderella shoes. I would like to smack that store clerk up the side of the head. I think they should train their salespeople a lot better. Really disappointed in the store -- the Las Vegas outlet.",negative
"Both of my kids have wide feet; Stride Rite makes great shoes for them. If you sign up for their rewards program, they will send you coupons. This location always seems to have a better selection than the other store at the North Outlet center. We are regular customers here.",positive
This kid of mine is growing like crazy! I swear I spend a fortune on his footwear! I brought him in to get measured since his shoes were getting a little snug. They take such good care of me there. I just love shopping for shoes for him..and he actually likes it as well. I score two pairs of Sperry's for him..buy one get one pair 50% off! Score. I walk out feeling like a good mommy shopping here.. See ya in a few months..after the next growth spurt.,positive
"Walked into this place, waited at the counter for a good minute while the attendant looked down at her phone and typed incessantly, not acknowledging my existence. Talk about rude. Walked right back out, too bad I never even had a chance to review their product, but if that's the way they treat their customers, then I'd rather not spend any time or $ there.",negative
I like getting my hair cut and styled by Joshua. He is so knowledgeable that he taught me new things about hair products and styling as well as a great cut. Even 4 months after my hair cut my friends still ask me if I just got it cut because the layers add so much dimension and grow out so well. I would recommend him.,positive
"Charlene's haricuts are THE gold standard. I have been going to this studio since around 2004, with some comparison around town. Also enjoy a short scalp massage with Charlene. They also do great nails there!",positive
"I had my hair highlighted by Ryan and it was the worst highlight ive had in all my years of highlighting. I was scared from the beginning when she seemed as if she has never done a highlight in her life and I left with orange tinted roots. I had to get it fixed at a different salon back home and the stylist even said ""WOah what happened here"" hopefully I can find a salon in Madison that has some stylist who know what they are doing",negative
"I recently had a wax with Bridgie and it was great. The waxing room maybe leaves a bit to be desired, but Bridget's skill can't be beat. The price and talent make this the best place I've found in Madison for wax.",positive
"I visited the store today and the Manager Carmen was awesome. She helped me out and answered all my questions. The staff is always very helpful, the store is clean and organized. They have good deals. I love their shoes !",positive
"Finally! Ever since this store renovated and moved a couple stores down, the workers are so much nicer & they help me every time I come in. Idk if it's under new renovation but I like coming to this store again :)",positive
"Sahaii is a new employee here and she is completely amazing. She has such a great personality and her confidence makes her stand out. She was so sweet and helpful, not just to me but to everyone who walked in the doors. My previous visit here wasn't so great and I almost didn't come back but I'm so glad I did. My first visit, I was basically followed around the store by a manager who made it very obvious that she thought I was going to steal something. Super awkward and annoying. Sahaii definitely made up for the first crappy experience tho!",positive
"Great sales, the owner/manager is very friendly, every time I go into this place I find at least one thing, which is rare for me because I tend to be super picky and spend all day in a store trying stuff on and walk out with nothing. But if I go here I am guaranteed to at least find one thing. I love that the prices are affordable and also that it's close to my house. Going to the mall all the time when I want to do a little shopping is a pain sometimes, this neighborhood spot is perfect. It satisfies my shopping craving every time,",positive
"I was attracted to this place because of the large selection of well priced clothes however was horribly disappointed with the way I was treated upon walking into the store. I needed jeans so I approached a lady behind the counter (later identified as Justina) and began the sentence: ""hi, I'm looking for jeans but..."" And I'm rudely interrupted with an eye roll and a pointing finger ""the jeans are right there. Right in front of you. Do you see them?"" EXCUSE ME!!! Beyond rude. I was just going to ask if you had any brands that run long because I'm 5'10 and didn't want to spend all night trying on jeans. I won't be returning.",negative
"This store has pretty good sales! $2, $3, $4,$5 rack I found a dress and two shorts I only paid $13. Funny that this store is right next door to Ross. There are similar brands that they sell but thankfully I went in here first instead of Ross. The shorts I wanted were only $3. At Ross it was $8. They have a promotion going on where you spend more than $40 you get $20 off your next purchase of $40. I need to go here one more time before I leave to rack up $40 of stuff to only pay $20. A good deal is a good deal! The store is kept very neat & tidy which is a plus especially while shopping! Lots & lots of parking available you don't have to worry about not finding parking! The sales associate that helped me was really nice. She greeted me as soon as I walked into the store, told me their promotions going on & asked if there was anything in particular I was looking for. They have a VIP shopping card but since I'm not from here I didn't sign up. It was funny having a conversation with her & finding out that she is from Mililani. So far I really like this store, it's the second one I've been to while in Las Vegas! I'll definitely walk into another one!",positive
Walked in and no one greeted me although I saw about 3 girls that worked there that I know for a fact saw me. They gave a look like I shouldn't be shopping there. No one was helpful and it's a shame too because I was in there to do a little shopping for my daughters birthday. One thing I will not tolerate is bad customer service which starts the second you walk into an establishment. Will not go back!,negative
"Ioan and the entire staff are amazing! Alterations turned out amazing and bought 3 new ties as well. If you're in the Phoenix/Scottsdale area, this is your go to for great suits/clothing",positive
"Stopped by Suitsupply for a last-minute interview suit. I admit I was nervous as usually suits aren't something you can just grab off the shelf and go. Thankfully I was assisted by Ioan who put my fears to rest, as I walked out same day with a fine-quality, tailored suit for a reasonable price. We were greeted as soon as we entered the shop, and had courteous, professional service the entire time. Ioan simplified the selection process by asking just a few questions. Honestly, the only difficulty I encountered was choosing just the right tie. Within 45 minutes I felt comfortable knowing that I had a great looking suit appropriate for an interview. I was slightly bummed that they didn't have the matching shoes in stock for my size, but this actually worked out for the better. I found a similar set of Aldos at Nordstrom Rack for a fifth of the price. I'm not really a suit-and-tie person, but for those few moments in life where I need to look damn good, I'll come back to Suitsupply.",positive
"As I first walked in I thought that everyone was going to be stuck up and rude, but that was not true. My husband and I where greeted with kindness and the gentleman who greeter us was more than helpful.",positive
This place is amazing. Dave is phenomenal!!! You walk in and tell him what you are looking for and he does the rest. The suits are custom fit and are ready in a few days. I went in to pick them up and I bought a few ties and the service was excellent again. The suits are definitely quality and exceeded my expectations considering the price. I highly recommend Suit Supply!,positive
"I'm looking to separate from the military so I needed a civilian suit for job interviews. Jordan helped me pick out the perfect suit for a good price, and gave the perfect tailoring recommendation. I wore it for the first time at an anniversary dinner and I'm extremely impressed with the quality of the material. Props to Jordan for the good customer service.",positive
"A highlight of my trip to Arizona. Like many other folks here, I was visiting from the LA area and decided to stop by. All of the guys working here were professional, friendly, and knowledgeable, especially Kevin. He struck a great balance between helping with specific requests and adding his own advice. Suitsupply's product is made of excellent materials and comes (mostly) at a very reasonable price point. The only drawback I encountered was not being able to find the attire I wanted in my desired size, despite the size of this location. In the previous week I had visited Suitsupply's other locations in Los Angeles (Venice and Beverly Center), and this Scottsdale one definitely seems better stocked, so your experience may be better. Having said that I would not hesitate to return next time I am in the area. Practical tip: not easy to find from the road. Go to the movie theater and take the escalator/stairs/elevator to the second floor. Beautiful location, just tucked away from the road.",positive
"Was visiting from LA where we don't have a SuitSupply yet and thank god we don't because I would spend all my money there. As soon as I walked in I was greeted immediately. The store was very impressive and I was helped by Daniel who knew exactly what I wanted and best of all gave me honest feed back and made great suggestions. I was in and out in less than an hour with a fitting and best of all they'll ship my suit to LA! I can't recommend this place enough, even after they open one in LA I will definitely give my business to Daniel and Suit Supply.",positive
Ask for Daniel he got me in and out in a good time. He was very knowledgeable at his work and definitely is going to keep me coming back for more. I look forward to working with him further. I am terrible at putting together outfits and he set me up for one a day for the week. Definitely a gem this one. Good find suitsupply!,positive
Wow. Just wow. Excellent quality suits AND service. One of my suits was damaged (stained) just after purchase and not only did they take it back in and remove the stain completely - they did it without charge. THANK YOU DAVE AND EVERYONE ELSE AT SCOTTSDALE SUITSUPPLY!!!,positive
"It was my first time at a Suitsupply, and my expectations were high going in. I immediately was helped by THE Chris. The man has panache. Chris is so good that I'm predicting he gets hired as Ryan Gosling's private stylist by this time next year. He has a combination of elegance & precision in his work that would leave Jony Ive impressed. Needless to say, the guy sold me 3 suits and 2 blazers, which I couldn't be happier about. My friend who came with me was helped by Taylor, who was equally as impressive. She was knowledgeable, spunky, and very pleasant work with. Huge snag by the folks at Suitsupply HQ. My understanding is that my friend left incredibly satisfied with the two suits she sold him, and may have possibly fallen in love during the process.",positive
What a wonderful place! It is such a trendy atmosphere and the staff were so friendly and knowledgable. We were helped By a gentlemen named Chris. He truly went above and beyond for our needs. We were getting a suit tailored which he pinned himself and also helped pick out the perfect shirt as well for the suit. Chris was so professional and caring. They really offer high quality products that come with a great price tag! I loved how the seamstress sits right up front where you can see her working. Such a great place. I can't recommend them enough!,positive
Great service and great prices. Just happened to see this store when headed to the movies. Glad to see a high quality yet affordable men's store open here. Definitely recommend this store for a new suit. The staff are knowledgeable and the tailor works right out in the open. Cool concept!,positive
Best customer service and friendliness of any Swatch store in Vegas!! Bryson and Atsumi knew the stories of the watches and were great!,positive
Atsumi was amazing. She helped my husband find a couple watches that we couldn't get at other stores and she was super friendly.,positive
"Brought my Swatch in for a band repair. They cleaned the face and I bought a new watch for my wife as well. The people were awesome, helpful and it was the best customer service I have had in a long time. Love this place.",positive
"I'm new to this whole ""watch"" thing, but once I decided to keep time on my wrist, I was suggested to check out Swatch at the Forum Shops. The shop (which is located in an inconvenient area of the mall, but I can hardly blame this on Swatch) is bright and noticeable, and although small, has plenty of watches on display. Customer service is fantastic. The cashier there helped me find the watch I was looking for, set it to the minute, and conviced me to buy three more watches for equal price as the watch I bought. Suffice to say he was a good salesman. A week later I realized I will never use those three other watches. I was upset to find out that I could not return them for money, instead returning them for another watch. So the lack of refund is an annoyance that I wish he would have told me. Also, a small complaint I have is that there aren't any chairs. I know that people don't spend much time in a watch store, but not having the option to sit down and admire watches does leave a bit to be desired. So, there you go. The Swatch store is great because it has a kooky and wide variety of watches at reasonable prices. Make sure you are completely sold on the watch you are buying, because you cannot gain money back for it. Also, get your sitting fix before walking in there, because there isn't a chair in sight. All in all, I had the Time of my life in there.",positive
"Who didn't have a Swatch watch when they were a kid right? I made a special trip to the Swatch store in the Forum Shops at Cesar's Palace to reminisce and buy a watch for memories sake. I walked in and was greeted by a friendly sales associate. I told him why I was in there and he said he hears the ""I had a Swatch as a kid"" story all the time. I was in the store for about an hour debating on which watch to get. I really wanted a funky one to commemorate the one I had as a kid but when I was trying them on they just didn't seem to fit the adult me anymore. I ended up purchasing a bracelet style one which pink crystals in the face of the watch and a bracelet style wrist. Not very Swatchish but I liked it so I got it. I was pleased with how pleasant the sales associate was with my incisiveness he let me try on what felt like every watch under the sun. Thinks to note, every watch comes with an International 2 year warranty. Same features as any other warranty. Some features that are not are that they will mail you batteries as needed and rebuff the face of the watch as many times at any Swatch store location.",positive
"My visit to this store was indeed memorable. It was when I made a trip to this SWATCH Las Vegas Caesar Forum Store this past summer... if only I can DIE having all the SWATCH watches all across the globe... Came with hubby, my good fren and her fiancee to this store... for some SWATCH watches delights!!! My good fren is also into SWATCH watches too... I have been purchasing and collecting SWATCH watches since the late 80's... and I cant have enough of them for my collection and ""craze"" of SWATCH watches.... If only COLORADO has one store like this one... *sigh*... But I heard recently they might have a limited collection at Nordstrom Cherry Creek Shopping Center (#37) in Denver, Colorado.... Perhaps I would definitely check the SWATCH watches there for my upcoming birthday & Xmas pressies...",positive
"Disappointed- too much stuff crammed into this space - not all that appealing. Was looking to sell a few items - Woman was very friendly & helpful -- the owner, not so much!",negative
"I love, love, love this place. I have brought my mother, sister and friends here and everyone had the same reaction-pure giddiness! This is a treasure of a store in CLE and a place you can spend an afternoon. The store is layered and layered and well organized considering how dense it's merchandise is. Amazing figurines, dish ware, clothes, purses and hats, jewelry and tchotchkes! The owner is so kind and helpful and I would recommend to anyone who loves a little bit of history with a twist! Merchandise of all price points and just a really happy store!",positive
"Very friendly management. Prices are higher than thrift store but lower than eBay. The issue is not whether there are enough things to look at. The selection of what they do carry is deep enough that Sweet Lorain must be a great resource for film and TV costumers and prop masters nationwide. Much more clothes and small housewares-oriented than furniture-oriented. I see no sign of this now, but remember the store that was here before, the similarly-named but far more sparse ""Suite Lorain,"" carrying small electric appliances (and some larger appliances) in the back in the early 1990s. The only limitations to me were square footage and my time. Keep your phone and wallet (or purse) on you. I set my phone down to try something on. The inside of the clothing area is so busy and packed, I couldn't get focus on where my phone might be. I had to walk up to the counter and have the manager dial me so I could find it by sound.",positive
FANTABULOUS!!!!!! We were on a hunt... Not just any hunt but a hunt for the perfect Halloween costume! I haven't been to Sweet Lorain since it was Suite Lorain and that was a few years ago and at that time it just seemed unorganized and disheveled. Also I really didn't see anything that remotely caught my attention so I left empty handed... Fast forward... HOLLY CRAP!!! Thiis place is now JAMMED with kitschy nicknacks and bric-a-brac that seems to go on forever!!! The woman that was helping us was engaging and very helpful even though she was up to her elbows in new arrivals! I made a mental note on what I saw so that when I start getting all crazy cat lady on my house I know where to start!!!!,positive
"The new owner Redwin is a blast! Great guy and aims to please. Countless hours must be invested when touring this establishment as there is so much to see. I like to think of it as a treasure hunt but I have no idea what I am hunting for until I see it! Just a wonderful place today, stuck in a wonderful time of yesterday. The prices are reasonable and some are even better. If you consider that some of the stuff you are looking at cost more on the West Coast, you would come to understand the value of living in Ohio. LOL",positive
"I heard about this place from a co-worker, and from what they said it seemed just up my alley. When he told me they had a big selection of records the vinyl junkie inside me just had to check it out. When I stepped inside I was blown away by the massive amount of records they have. The vinyl isn't in perfect order by no means but that is half the fun of it. Each time you flip through a record you don't know what your going to come across next. Then suddenly you find the diamond in rough. I could spend hours there just digging through the crates. I highly recommend this place for vinyl junkies who don't mind getting down on their hands and knees and digging through some dusty bins. This is a place I will come back to.",positive
"Slightly overpriced, but one of the most organized antique shops I have ever been to! They also have quantity, so if you are looking for sets of plates/glasses/ anything to match, you can definitely find it here. We went here on a date and it was a total blast!",positive
"Slightly overpriced, but possibly the best selection of items of all eras in Cleveland. Pam (forgive me if it's Pat) has a fab haircut and was appropriately attentive and even encouraging. Whatever the man's name is who handles the retail transactions is a snarky so and so, but whatevs. This place is definitely worth a trip!",positive
"Amazing selection, well organized. I had an afternoon to kill in Cleveland, and thought I would go antique-store-hopping. Once I found Sweet Lorain, I didn't have to hop any more. I was told that the merchandise here is for sale on behalf of many owners. Usually, I find places like that are a hodge-podge, and a warren of over-crowded little ""shop-ettes"" in no apparent order. SL has things organized by the kind of thing you might want to buy. Furniture, lamps, men's coats, vintage ash trays - the works. The vintage women's clothing is organized by decade! I wasn't shopping for that, but the intention of the organization is commendable. I found the prices to be on par with other reputable places. I bought a few things - nothing qualified as ""a steal"", but this is an ongoing business with overhead and a tremendous amount of merchandise. It isn't an estate sale where everything gets sold by 5 PM or it goes into the dumpster. The owner knows a lot about much of the merchandise and manufacturers, which makes it fun to browse and shop.",positive
"One of the best vintage shops in Cleveland! The owner is so sweet and pleasant to talk to! The clothing aisles can be overwhelming, but I have found amazing, one of a kind pieces here. You just have to dig for a while till you strike gold. The quality of clothing is totally justified by the price.",positive
"The prices are high making the atmosphere ""stuffy."". It's not like it's Antiques Roadshow stuff. So, there was that disappointment.",negative
"Very cool shop and an overwhelming selection of vintage goodies. Very friendly shop owner. The prices are on the high side, but this place has eliminated the hunting on the customer's part. If it's vintage and cool, they more than likely have it.",positive
"I have been collecting old furniture and housewares for over 20 years. Sweet Lorraine was a breath of fresh air when I relocated here from Detroit. To be correct, this is not an antique shop. Rather a vintage clothing, furniture, housewares and collectables shop. Greaser's paradise for sure. They have amassed a huge fortune in great merchandise from the thirties through the eighties. The one owner will spy on you asking you if she can help you find anything. Truth be told, you don't go in there looking for anything. That thing will find you instead. I could spend a hundred dollars every Saturday in this place and I would still not have enough. Lots of cool lamps, vases, ashtrays, furniture and vintage everything. Located on the very edge of Detroit Shoreway /Gordon Square- its easy to find with plenty of parking. A must stop while visiting Cleveland. Take a ride to Happy Dog when you're done!",positive
"I was a bit confused after going to Sweet Lorain. I should have listened to Cara! So many rave reviews made this shop sound not only sweet, but absolutely delectable... unfortunately it was simply not so. When I go to an antique shop I'm not simply looking for things that are old or used, I'm looking for something that is quality - furniture that is crafted by passionate carpenters or decor that symbolizes that beauty of times past. I'm not looking for old crap and dusty trinkets or dingy, out-of-style clothes. I would go to a thrift shop for those things. Perhaps my expectations of Sweet Lorain were simply not fair. Maybe this is exactly what it wants to be. If that's the case, I stand corrected. So, if you want to know what you WILL find at Sweet Lorain, here's what I saw: lots and lots of old clothing (admittedly some odd stuff that might be useful for costume parties or Halloween), lots and lots of vintage porn, old records, old low-quality kitchen wares, random trinkets, low-quality 70s and 80s prints, and a wall of colored glass vases. I'll admit that the colored vases were quite nice but the prices on those items were more along the lines of what you'd find in a high-end furniture shop than in a dirty antiques/thrift store. I was disappointed with my visit here because I had read so many incredible reviews. I have a feeling that many of those reviews reflect the nostalgia of what this place used to be rather than the current reality.",negative
"A friend recommended that I had to check out Sweet Lorain. I was not disappointed. It was much larger than I expected and had a lot of mid-century clothing, furniture, bar ware and other items. Compared to many vintage stores I have been to it was very well organized. I thought the pricing was very fair. If you are going to be in Cleveland, this is definitely the first vintage store to check out.",positive
"I was told I had to visit Sweet Lorain during my recent visit to Cleveland - it did not disappoint! There really aren't any vintage shops in the Detroit area with so much good stuff to rifle through (that I know of, at least). Lots of themed sections, from owls, mushrooms, florals, holidays, colors, comic book characters, etc., & also organized by item type & room. The staff was very friendly, too, which was awesome. The only downside is definitely the prices - I'm personally not a collector, so I don't see the value in a $24 set of salt & pepper shakers, though some people might. I ended up leaving with a $10 record & a $3 wooden brooch, but if I had more money or my eye set on something, I would've purchased more.",positive
"There are a lot of negative reviews about Sweet Lorain which makes me sad. I have been traveling to Sweet Lorain (former Suite Lorain) for the past 3-4 years and it's always been a wonderful experience. Now with Red owning the place it's become even that much more special of an vintage shopping adventure. Every time we visit Red always says, ""Welcome Home!"" and is so warm and helpful and full of jokes! There is a new Tiki section that I am enjoying along with the more organized and better lit clothing departments! I love Sweet Lorain, Cleveland doesn't know how lucky they are to have this gem in their city!",positive
"What can I say, I'm a loyal customer who visited this amazing store back when the owners were women & now with the new owner, Redwin Lewis. I must say, regardless of whose owned this store, I have always found it interesting and enjoy the unique inventory. Price wise, I don't see much of a difference between Sweet Lorains, Flower Child or Etsy.com. But I recently visited on 01/12/13 and feel that the staff & the owner himself went above & beyond! I was searching for a wedding dress but didn't expect to find anything on my first visit. Not only did I find a beautiful gown but Redwin searched his store until he found some beautiful vintage jewelry that he felt would be a good match, he even found 3 tiaras and made numerous suggestions to improve my big day. Redwin & his young employee behind the counter said that 100's of girls have tried on my dress but know one could fit into it, so they both waited until I exited the fitting room...I ended up dancing with Redwin, he wanted me to see just how big the dress truly is as he twirled me around. His co-worker helped me search through their glove selection and they even found the perfect pair of matching earrings for me. They both loved my wedding theme (Eco-friendly/vintage) and had pictures taken with me while in the dress. And for just $200.00 I got a unexpected Eco-friendly conversation piece -can guarantee there's no other bride out there with a dress like mine :) The only real issue I could see anyone having is that they are still going through the stores products & trying to organize them & that some things are a little over priced. But I've read the other reviews on here & don't think enough people have done their homework, the prices they offer are pretty average. And let's face it, it's vintage- so stop whining about finding tears & holes in the clothing! Keep in mind things are priced based on uniqueness, demand, and quality; things were hand made back then - not the cookie cutting crap that's spit out in stores now. You should try looking at each imperfection as a part of a wonderful story & grab inspiration from that piece not b**ch & moan.",positive
"Sweet Lorain has lost something since the new owner took over. Though, he is doing a great job of finally getting things organized. Things are now organized by era and type of dress. All the plus size dresses are marked, which is great. If you are a plus size gal looking for vintage pieces, you're going to find more here than anywhere else in Cleveland. Their prices are definitely on the high side for the quality of garment you are typically going to find. A lot of garments are stained or ripped, so make sure you examine each piece carefully. Most of the records in the record section are unplayable due to scratches. The housewares & knick knack sections are really the reason to come here. Well organized and somewhat decently priced. If you are interested in dress making, there is a great selection of vintage fabrics and patterns. And the menswear section is impressive. Despite the not-so-secret shoppers making browsing a bit awkward, I do like to come here and browse, and occasionally I do find a treasure.",negative
"This vintage store is super fun, although I have to agree with some of the recent reviews - it's not what it used to be. Things used to be organized better - I don't really know how to describe it, but it seemed like more care was given to the place. I still love to stop in to check things out every time I visit Cleveland. The prices are decent for the quality.",positive
"Out of sheer curiosity the boyfriend and I just had to stop by Sweet Lorain when we were hopping around the antique shops on Lorain. Yikes. And this is coming from two people who scour the most random, dirty, weirdo thrift stores for treasures--this place is borderline unshoppable. First of all, it looks like at one point in time someone tried to care about this place. Now it appears its inventory has been neglected for a long, long time. Dusty, thrown upon each other... It was too difficult to look through. Certain parts were still semi organized into ""shops"", but it looks like that concept has been long thrown to the wind and now things are just everywhere. You can't even walk up to stuff to look at it closely. I haven't even been to a thrift store this unorganized. Second, the price tags I did see where way too large. I get it. Your inventory is retro and fun. But just because you call yourself a vintage store does not mean you can forget that your merchandise is still used. Meaning: not new. It's unique, but not worth what you're pricing it. The worst part was that the guy at the counter (who knows who he was) was deciding the cost of things right in front of customers and pointing out the most silly reasons to up the prices. I guess from all the stories I heard about this place in the past being amazing made me pretty shocked to see it in its current state. I certainly hope this place eventually falls into the hands of someone who will actually care about it again. This different ownerships just isn't working out. Sigh... the memories of the previous ""Suite Lorain"" must live on only in our memories. Sweet Lorain just isn't living up to that standard.",negative
"I absolutely love this store. I was blown away by the variety, style, design, and attention to detail for just about every item I stumbled upon. And the store is so organized!! I found some true gems, and they were priced very reasonably considering the condition and quality. Must see for yourself!",positive
"Very disappointing all around. Had some questions about a few pieces in the shop, and I was met by an angry store owner. All I was doing was asking questions, yet he treated me like I was insulting his mother. I was interested in a lamp, that was out of my price range- and his reply went something like this "" Well, I dont want you buying it anyway. People who ask questions, present problems. "" I was dumbfounded. And when I came on here, and found the 1 other review of this place, I was not surprised. When you treat customers/potential customers so nasty- how do you expect to earn any business, or stay in business for that matter? I am a business owner myself, and treat people how I would want to be treated. Apparently this store owner does not share the same philosophy. High prices, nasty owner, will not be coming back and DEFINITELY wont recommend this place to anyone.",negative
I love shopping at all the discount retail stores especially TJ Maxx. However this location has bad customer service. I purchased a few items online and needed to return one. When I went up to the register the young girl that was helping me didn't know how to do a return from an online purchase. The lady working at the next register rudely said that I couldn't return my item without the original bag that the item was shipped in. Keep in mind I had the receipt and all tags were in tact. I told both of them that I've been able to return items in the past purchased online without any issues and no one has ever told me that I needed to keep the bag! The lady seemed like she wasn't happy with what I said and told the younger girl to call the manager which then said it would be fine and that they will take the return but I needed to remember to save the bag next time I decided to purchase any of their items online. What the heck?!?!,negative
"I love shopping at all the discount stores around and shop numerous times at TJ Maxx but this location is not one I normally go to, but went with friends and just have to say how rude the staff was in there... it was bad that 3 out of 4 put our stuff down and said not wasting our money here. Little courtesy and smile can go a long way! If closing get it as you want to go home but the rudeness and attitude was unnecessary!",negative
"I love this location! They always have a wide selection of the go tos: furniture, clothing, luggage, etc. The only thing I see lacking is a larger variety of shoes. A huge plus is that their clearance racks are also fully stocked.",positive
"I started going into this store a few months ago, and encountered a lady named Joann asked her for a certain product, her response was the biggest lie so I just avoided her. A few weeks ago an elder lady asked her for the same product and to my surprise she told her the same exact lie she told me a few months before. A few minutes after the encounter I heard her yelling at a different customer because she had the product that she lied about to the older lady! So, a week later we over heard the store manager Joseph and the assistant manager Luzanna bad mouthing a customer! This store is so horrible with how they treat customers! A lot needs change for sure!",negative
"Today my wife and 2 year old daughter went to the location in Peoria, AZ. She had left Nordstrom Rack 5 minutes prior and noticed an older male that followed her. After shopping in TJ Maxx she saw him waiting outside looking kind of suspicious. Just to be safe she asked the cashier and manager if she could be escorted to her car. A very nice young man named DAVID offered to help. No one made my wife feel dumb for asking or made it seem like an unreasonable request. David walked my wife and daughter out to our car ( in the 100 degree AZ heat) and even assisted in getting my daughter in the back of the car and putting her shoe back on. I just really wanted to make sure that this kind act did not go unnoticed. It may have been nothing...or it may have saved my wife and daughter from being assaulted by the stranger. We will never know but I do know that I am thankful for the staff at this location and being willing to go over and beyond the call of duty. Thank you!",positive
"I am a LOYAL TJ Maxx/Marshal's/Home goods store customer. ANYTHING I can buy there, I get there! Went to look around for a few items and was sorely disappointed in the customer service! I won't bore you with the details, but I will go out of my way to NEVER go to this store again. Based on other reviews, sounds like this is common at this store. Let's hope corporate takes a moment to look at these reviews.",negative
"This Tjmaxx is horrible I just went in to return something with my receipt and item with the tag on it and they couldn't return it ""because he receipt barcode wouldn't scan"" terrible customer service.",negative
"Beyond disappointed by their horribly RUDE customer service. Who trained the staff here, monkeys? Went in around the evening time with my cousin to return a shirt, but decided to look around a little before leaving. The time was 9, thirty minutes before closing. Come 9:20 I overheard the woman working the fitting room scorning this woman for wanting to try on a few items she had. Her tone was ridiculously nasty and she even told the woman to immediately use the first fitting room and kept insisting her to just ""hurry up."" At this point, my cousin and I made our way up to the register, it still WASN'T 9:30. My cousin had stopped at the isle right BESIDE the register just to browse at some makeup quickly. When an older woman with short hair, whose name I didn't get, from behind the register told my cousin and I to immediately ""come on and pay"" because ""the lights were turning off in 5 minutes"" and ""it's already hard enough for me to see but worse when it's dark so come on"". Really? I get that you're an older woman who is probably cranky from working but 1) if you're unhappy there, leave, and 2) Common sense in customer service is to maintain a good face to the public and being respectful to all your customers despite YOUR issues. I think if your store still isn't technically closed, you have no right to immediately start treating your customers like shit and rudely rushing them out. If THE MANAGERS CONDONE THIS TYPE OF BEHAVIOR from their employees, then shopping here surely isn't worth it.",negative
"HORRIBLE !!!!!! ! I went in today October,5,2016 at 8:45 pm with my two kids,husband and sister in law looking for athletic clothing for my husband . After wondering around the store my son got a hold of a squishy mat to work out, while walking he was hugging and squishing it very innocently not damaging the merchandise . I went into the home section and come across a worker named CARMELA just starting me down with my kids .Instantly I felt violated by look on her face because the fact my son kept touching not throwing touching everything upset her even more ! She had some nerve to stare me down in my face and say are you going to buy that .I instantly said no and handed her the merchandise . I did in fact call her rude and advise her to get another job if she was so unhappy . After speaking to the not so concern manager and staff I got even more upset!My Money is as green as yours and all your damn staff ! Carmela you pathetic racist b**** never make another remark to a mother that will do anything for her kids . I would have in fact purchased your Matt and had you stick it so far up your a** it would make you happy !! Live a little and all of you including the staff get a new job ! You suck at customer service",negative
I love this location. Always clean and very organized. This store stocks some things I haven't found at other stores. I shop here weekly!,positive
"In January I purchased an IT suitcase from this TJ Maxx. In May, I discovered that the the support for the frame of the suitcase was never finished. The manufacturer of the luggage essentially told me to go to H..l. and wanted $25 to ship me a new suitcase under the terms of their warranty. When I contacted TJ Maxx, they agreed to refund me the purchase price if I brought the suitcase back to there store. Best deal I ever got.",positive
"This used to be Borders. On the corner of Best In The West shopping center, where the Ulta, Old Navy & now, Marshalls is located. On our first visit, I didn't like it. Why? It is smaller than the average TJ Maxx store, so there is less inventory. I didn't find anything though. But it is clean. There is a security guard. Items are well-stocked. Today we visited, I had a $25 gift card (usually I have trouble finding something in this case), but we found a few things, one box of coffee K-cups, two home care items (silicone sponges & furniture felt pads) and one harness for our female dog; the grand total was $17.88. I considered a cute hat but didn't really need it. I checked out the bags. I also checked out the children's socks, the pet section & the home section side. I guess the more you browse, the more you will find. Today's visit really changed my original opinion. If we are in the area, we'll check it out. This chain remains one of my favorite stores too, for sure.",positive
"I came here to look for some accessories and cute decorations for our house. Store is one of the cleanest and most organized places I have been from TJ Maxx but unfortunately they don't have much items here in the home department. They have a wide selection of clothings. I was bored so I looked through the clothes of T-shirts, long sleeve shirts and other until I found a cute blouse from Lucky Brand. I can say I found my lucky shot and I am happy I looked through the clothes. Staff was very friendly. Store wasn't much busy but when we came to the checkout lane it was packed. Waited about 10 minutes till we got to the cashier. Nevertheless this place is alright and maybe will come back someday.",negative
"This is one of my favorite locations of this chain in town. It's usually not busy in the weekday evenings and early mornings on the weekend. I believe that Tuesday may be the day when they get new arrivals. Check the back of the store on both sides for clearance. There is more than one section! I like this location because of the good quality products here. Kate Spade, Cole Haan, etc. Some great stuff!",positive
Not your safe store management did not call police or prevent a couple walk out with merchandise galore!? You could see than bulked under their clothes and in their hands in broad daylight Security did not even try to follow the Or interception,negative
"So they say reviews are only written for the really good experiences and the really bad ones... My wife lost a black cardigan (that belonged to her mother who passed away 5 years ago) We walked inside the store and saw a lost prevention employee right inside so we acquired to a lost and found which we were told go to the front ""I don't know"" then we went to the front and the front said to meet someone in jewelry can answer our question (I lost faith by this point). We then went to jewelry to encounter an employee that asked over the store radio if a black cardigan was lost and gave us a ""no we don't have it within 10 seconds."" I would not come here if there was a 90% off sale. Thanks for nothing.",negative
"I shop in here at least twice a month and sometimes more if I am nearby. I always find something! I was never much of a fan of this chain when we lived in NC because I didn't like sifting through all the clothes and at that time it seemed there were more high end clothing so although discounted, it was still out of my budget back then. That was 15+yrs ago, and now I've come to enjoy shopping here. The clothes are more affordable than I remember, and I usually get luggage here. That's what really brought me back in. I was looking for the 4 wheeled luggage several years back and just so happened to peruse the whole store, and been going back since. At times I can find beauty products lower than in stores. I get makeup brushes and other items for a good price. The shoe section is a hit or miss. I've found nine west, sam edelman, guess, and other brands here. Not too shabby. I like the food section which is also hit or miss. My family likes the keurig coffee, so we've been going there for that, but lately it has not been in stock. And with this kind of store, you never know if you will see it again. They have a little bit of gourmet items too. The store is always clean and the customer service is great. Although the checkout lines seem long, it goes pretty fast because they have efficient cashiers.",positive
"I was looking for bathroom rug & noticed they had Bliss products & got pretty excited. There I am peeping about when I felt the need to ask a woman if she needed help with anything. No, I don't work there but was in retail through college and old habits die hard. Feeling it was strange I felt that way I looked up and it was an employee. Stupid lady I'm in my work scrubs do you really think I'm going to steal your cheap ass products? So yea. For the first time in my life I had an employee tail me assuming I was going to steal something. It was painfully obvious especially since once I looked up she backed off. I'm not coming back here. That's what security and your cameras are for. Have fun making your $9 an hour chubs.",negative
"Deidre was not friendly at all. I brought to her attention 2 huge scratches (not able to be fixed) in a product that I wanted to purchase and asked if they could discount it. She was SO unfriendly and embarrassed me, as if I was asking something totally ridiculous. She told me, ""We don't discount for things like that"". I would've got a different product, but this was the last one. She single handedly made my unusually nice trip to TJ Maxx terrible.",negative
I rushed into the store on our way to a wedding to find some jewelry to match my dress and the lady behind the counter helped me pick out the most beautiful necklaces and earnings to match... I wish I would have gotten her name because she was great and even out them on me because my nails were to long and I was rushing to not be late. Fabulous service from her I was so thankful she was there to help me,positive
"It's a new store and seems much more spacious, brighter, and more organized than all the other TJXs I've been to in Vegas. Nothing was strewn around, and the home department was much more appealing than in their other stores. The staff I interacted with were friendly. Now if they'd spend a few bucks and use price stickers that peel off easily, without me having to waste an eternity at home, wrestling with them along with GooGone or other smelly stuff, I'd definitely bump up their star rating.",negative
"Talk about rude . I came in to return something with a receipt from Home Goods . I was told I can return stuff to TJ Maxx . Before I even got 2 words out of my mouth the "" manager "" rudely said "" you can't bring that here, no no no, we don't do that here ."" Needless to say how their staff was just standing there twiddling their thumbs this store is going to go great .",negative
"Good for gym clothes and some clearance items- go elsewhere for anything else. Clearance section is a jumble, womens and juniors sections both mixed up together. Store has a giant cosmetics area and half-decent furniture and home decor, but I came for clothes and there was no organization to any of the sections I browsed and dresses were strewn all over the place. Went at noon on a weekday, so it's not as if I came just prior to close and wondered why it looked like a bomb had hit it.",negative
"Was here on opening day, 5.15.14. This location used to be a Borders in the corner of Best of the West shopping center. Lends itself to the discount giant as the space is large and feels ""open"" not like you are crammed in. On 5.15, it was packed with people, great merchandise, a DJ spinning and people to direct you to the next open cashier from the queue. Today, inventory looked a little picked over, except for the Men's department. With Father's Day approaching, clothing, baseball caps (including some Heat championship models) and gadgets are plentiful. The luggage section seems to be holding up with brands like Samsonite and Calvin Klein available in a variety of sizes at a discount better than outlets are offering. In the purse section, Dooney & Bourke was a good buy, but Coach is cheaper at outlet prices. Sunglasses=diverse inventory; picked up a cute pair of Juicy for $24.99. This is key for people like me who repeatedly lose them; stings less when they are cheapos. Like any other TJ Maxx, you have to be an educated consumer to do well here. Unlike other locations, this is bright, clean and well organized. The staff I've interacted with have all been super friendly. ***this car park is CRAZY! Dunno if it is proximity to 95/Rainbow/Lake Mead, but be careful. Free-for-all mentality*** Welcome to the 'Hood! Worth a peek.",positive
"This store just opened. I found a marble rolling pin, a marble mortar and pestle, some Doc McStuffins underwear and a cute teddy bear for under $30 out the door. As with any TJ Maxx great prices and a lot of stuff to look at. The parking lot was kind of dangerous with people swiping up spots and getting a little aggressive. The associates here were calm and moved the check out lines pretty quickly. This is a great location for a TJ Maxx and fills out this strip mall nicely. I visited towards the last half hour before closing and will definitely return during the day to browse. The aisles and pathways are clean and there are plenty of associates roaming the floors and picking up items that customers either knock off the hangers or rearrange.",positive
This target is the perfect size for me! Always has awesome things on the clearance aisles. Team members there seem very happy and helpful.,positive
"My grandson and I went last Saturday to buy him some clothes. First, stores always have more girls clothes than boys, which is frustrating in the first place. We went into the boys department, and there are girls clothes mixed in with the boys clothes, and not like a customer left a few items. An entire section was girls clothes mixed with the boys clothes, so now the selection of boys clothes is even smaller. It was difficult to find just some basic T-shirts, shorts, and casual long pants. I am seeing comments in many places that people are turning to Walmart for their shopping. I guess, in the future, I will, too.",negative
"Target stores are the best, and this location is no exception. This location is easy to get in and out. Changing rooms are gender neutral and family friendly. Returning items are a breeze. I've not used their pharmacy as of this review. This location has manned checkout stations as well as four self check out stations. Bathrooms are always tidy.",positive
"Target.com pick up orders they do not know what they are ding. they claimed items on my order were not available. i walked right to the items in the store and showed them they are available, including when calling because Target.com has a major gliche with orders, youll submit an order it will say it is ready and it is not, then the store says they have no record call Target.com well they dont have an answer but a gliche, didnt verify my entire account information is probably why they have major security breaches. wouldnt trust them ever again.",negative
"I'm a huge Target fan! I grew up near this location so it feels a little nostalgic. I stopped by today on my way to an appointment. I had forgotten they're on the smaller side. I was disappointed with how tiny their Maternity section is. I don't even think you could call it a ""section"" - it was really just 2 racks & that's it. I know it's a weekend so they're busy but the store was surprisingly messy. I made my way through almost the entire store picking up odds & ends & every area seemed disheveled. & aside from the very friendly cashier, everyone else I encountered seemed stressed & rushed. I had to speedily follow an employee around the Women's section & basically get in front of her in order to finally get her attention to ask where something was. She seemed bothered.",negative
"My partner and I came into this target and we were going to buy two pairs of jeans each. Plus to work out gloves. We went to go try on jeans and I set the workout gloves on the counter where the attendant is stationed. While I was inside trying on jeans I can overhear the attendance lady saying that I was planning on stealing the workout gloves. She called a security guard and was talking to him which I can clearly hear everything she was saying. The security guards name is Trent. He then began to follow my partner and I around as we were shopping. I find extremely rude that the target associates were targeting me because I am young, because now I didn't buy anything from the store and will never buy anything from the store again. Also I will tell all of my friends my experience and they will not shop at that store. I expect an apology from that store if they ever want my business back or my friends business back. It is completely unprofessional and rude. I brought all my items up to guest services and told her exactly why I brought them there. Way to go target.",negative
"My charity organization did a holiday sponsorship of a family, and to keep things simple, we did a target registry for donations to be purchased from. Due to a shipping issue, the items didn't arrive on time, and I purchased them myself (so now we've purchased two of everything and I've personally spent over $500) thinking I'd return them after the shipped items arrived. When that happened, I took my packing slips and the items to this Target in Tempe to attempt to return the items and get my refund. First, the staff was not very helpful, and was kind of rude right off the bat. Then, while in the middle of trying to handle my return, the person helping me and the person at the next register started talking negatively about the customer that had just left the other register. Now, my friend who was with me had the email receipt on her phone, and said so, but the Target ""customer service"" people completely ignored her. So they start taking the items back and tell me they're going to give me a gift card. Um NO, I used my credit card that I need to pay back for this, I can't do that with a Target gift card. they insisted that was the only way they could do the return. I took the items and my receipts and was able to complete a return with refund at another store. I won't be going to this store again, and due to the issues with returns, I will NOT be using Target as my gift registry for future charitable donation events.",negative
"Shopping at Target on black Friday. I have been a loyal shopper at this target since 1998. Never again.. You were headed in through a tunnel of plastic caution tape to navigate your shopping we went to buy a vacuum on sale which ended up being more expensive then the add looked like but Was going to get it my wife wanted a doll we couldn't find it proceeded to fine employee with add the one I found didn't have one? Found employee in area and she was having difficulty serving multiple customers. When I found out that the dolls where in a bin at the clothing area I went in search of my wife who was looking for them I went around to see if she went to registers when I was going to cut through employee stopped me said I couldn't go through plastic tape and I had to go back around so I left my cart then she said I couldn't leave it their so that started it, don't tell your paying customers what they are able to do in a public establishment. I told her I to keep it i wasn't going to buy it when I found my wife we left and had to walk over plastic chain rope to get out of the store what a disaster and total cluster (f-'""-) I will never go to a black Friday sale ever again or step foot in a target.",negative
I love target. But this last experience left me pretty upset. I found a cars set that my son really wanted. It was priced for $5.29 after I checked out I noticed it was rung up for $19.99 after having to wait in line at customer service for 16 minutes before being helped. The girl had to walk over to toys because no one was responding to her call to check. She comes back with some toy cars that were not even near where this box of cars were and said it was for these next to them it was just pushed over so it isn't that price. So my son then had to give back the cars as I couldn't afford to spend $20 for them. He was so heart broken and as she had to take it from his hands he was bawling and so upset. I get it that it was priced wrong on the shelf and that's a significant price difference. But not only did she lie saying that the ones it was priced for was right next to it (and it wasn't). She wouldn't honor the mistake made by the store especially when it was priced and more than 4 of them were in that spot. But ultimately the fact that she had to take it from my son and watch him sit on the floor bawling over having to give It back to them and being so upset. I couldn't get him out of the store because of how upset he was. The lady behind us even offered to buy it for us after having watched the whole thing. It's was just very unsettling. It is hard enough to take a toddler to the store let alone allowing him to pick out a toy then having to give it back and not understanding why.,negative
"My dads birthday is tomorrow, & I must work tomorrow unfortunately & came to target to purchase a camera for his birthday. I looked at a specific camera and they stated they did not have it available. So out of desperation I just picked another camera, they did not have that either. I then picked another camera, & they did not have that either. They literally had no camera selection available or perhaps in stock. These are expensive electronic items, I feel like it's quite inconvenient for them to run out of electronics. & even worse every single type of camera. Will not come back.",negative
"I wish there was a way to comment about the pharmacy alone. Target itself is fine...however, the fact that they switched to CVS Pharmacy within Target is upsetting and frustrating. Prices have gone up. Waits have gone up. The staff don't know how to use the new computer system, nor are they very friendly. It sure was great using the Target Pharmacy before they switched over. Now we'll be going back Walgreens.",negative
"My family used to shop Target all the time, but only shop specific advertised items now. Here are some of the reasons that Target has dropped off my routine shopping circuit: *Since they closed their garden centers, you can no longer park close to where you plan on making purchases in the store. This is difficult for the mobility impaired who then have to traipse through the entire huge space of this big box store to get what they need. *Checkout lanes are understaffed. Lines get absurdly long. Again, this is worse now that the garden centers have closed. The check out in the garden center took some of the pressure off of the main checkout lanes. *Target used to have great clearance sales with 75% off of clearance items. The ""clearance"" shelves are now packed with merchandise that is 15-30% off full retail price. Heck, that doesn't even qualify as a decent ""sales"" price, let alone a ""clearance"" price. *Today I left again empty handed. I tried to buy 4 items in their weekly ad. They were out of all 4 items. *The quality of Target items has declined over time. It used to be that Target was priced between Walmart and department stores like Sears and JC Penneys and had products that were more in the department store quality. Most products are now Walmart quality. One example is 12 mid-priced towels that I bought at Target that totally unraveled the first time I washed them (before using them for the first time). When I returned them the customer service rep stated that the same thing had happened to her when she purchased these towels. *Employees had about 1/3 of the aisles blocked with boxes for restocking the shelves (why the heck can't they do this before the customers are in the store?). *Let's not forget the ""joy"" of identity theft generated by their massive data breach that they waited months to alert the public and victims to. *One of the reasons for visiting this store today is that their web site states that this store has a photo center. Ha! Ha! Fooled me. What they have is a self-serve kiosk and no one to help you if you run into problems. I ended up going to Walgreens to get my photo work done. Interestingly, it was less expensive to get my 12 photo enlargements at Walgreens due to a flyer discount of 33% on all photo enlargements--PLUS I got personal, HUMAN assistance. Sigh, another decent store goes down the drain.",negative
What can I say...it's Target. Who doesn't love Target!? I enjoy this location because it's separate from any major shopping plaza's so I don't have to deal with a huge crowd of cars trying to enter the parking lot. I do however find that the parking lot here is a bit small. Granted there is ample space around the building. But there's just 3 short rows located right in front of the door. Which is ideal parking space for Arizona summers. The actual store itself is always clean and for the most part always stocked. They have great employees that are always helpful.,positive

"A small but quaint Target, I love that I can shop for everything that I need in a hurry without feeling like I need to cross the Sahara Desert to get the things I need. There is a Fry's Marketplace across the street, so you can get all of your shopping done in one trip!",positive
"They have the fitbit aria scale here! So it's $129.99. The fitbit flex in slate or violet is $99.99. Yeesh! I don't shop here routinely but this is one of the stores I come to purchase cd's when they're on sale. For whatever reason they have a much better selection than Mall Wart and they usually have a new release, that I might like, at a low price every couple of months. What I don't like about Target is their cheezy baskets of seasonal items on display near the entrance. Lots of poor quality, Made in China items, sold for next to nothing. I see most of this stuff as waste that frequently winds up at Goodwill and/or landfills. The store is generally clean and shelves stocked. The staff is pleasant enough. Not sure how much profit they've generated now that all employees walk around attached to walkie talkies (you remember those right? I mean you're old enough to remember those, right?), but wish they could turn the volume down on the things and possibly refrain from following me while talking on them. I always turn around to see if they're talking to me because like I said, I don't shop here regularly.",negative
This used to be where the students went before Tempe Marketplace opened. The staff here are always friendly and the crowd is older Tempe. They could use an update but they are way better than the one on Longmore. This Target has everything I need!,positive
When they have shopping door busters I like this Target cuz its not too busy and I am usually first in line or one of very few. Who doesnt like Target?,positive
"This is the Target we used to shop at when I was a kid. Sure it isn't as large, nor does it have the shiny new sheen of the Target at Tempe Marketplace, but it still holds the charm and memories of random shopping trips of a bygone era. Employees are friendly, and it's easy to navigate through the aisles. Another plus is that this location isn't as busy, and you don't have to battle with the Tempe Marketplace traffic if all you need are random household items just from Target!",positive
"Now let me just start by saying I freaking LOVE Target. Okay, so anyway. I can't believe I'm the first person to review this location, it's an ancient store compared to the new ones. Don't tlet that fool you though, it is remodeled. The store remodel is a good and a bad thing however. I just moved to this area recently so I'm not sure in what shape this store was before the facelift, but I'm sure it needed it. Very nice and refreshed inside, clean, your typical Target red EVERYWHERE. It's already a kinda weird layout to begin with seeing as this location is set up as a square rather than a normal, longer rectangle most Target stores are layed out as, but in the remodel they added a grocery section with fresh food and more pantry options. I'd add a star for that and the added convienence the extra grocery brings now that it is a p-fresh location like all other Target's have become, but in order to add that larger grocery area they've had to significantly shrink other departments in the store to compensate, so minus extra star we just added. Moral of the story here is this Target is great if you just need to run in for a few basics, but if you have detailed shopping or you're looking for something specific it's probably a better idea to drive either way on McClintock to the Tempe Marketplace Target or Chandler Santan Target. This location is still nice to get you by though. They have a food court with Pizza Hut Express, Pharmacy tucked way back in the corner, and a nice Photo Lab up by the front door, which is my favorite thing here. They took photo out of most Target Stores so it's nice this has one being closest to my house to just ride up quickly and print out a few pics! Overall just a very standard, plain Target Store. Nothing too special here. Just enought to get you through the week.",negative
"This is always our 2nd choice Target. If we cant find something at the TMP location, we come here. The staff here is always friendly, albiet a bit strange. I always kind of feel like this Target is set up differently than other locations. I always for get that theres more to it while walking thru.",positive
"This review is not for the store, because the store is fine and I like it. Even though there is no starbucks here. It is still a nice store. My review today is for the Pharmacy. What a disaster I had here. Proving once again that the Target store on 44th street is the very best one to go to for your scripts. I came here on the 4th to drop off 2 scripts to be filled. They did not have one of them and so they would have to order it. Fair enough, I understand that. Great,I will pick them both up on Saturday. They called me on Friday which was very nice to say they did not receive the item and would get it on Tuesday. Thank you for calling me and saving me time. I am very grateful for that. So Tuesday Afternoon I go to Target to get my 2 scripts. Ryan, my cashier finds them, rings them up,I pay, and then he disappears without telling me what is going on and not giving me my scripts.???? I am standing at the counter waiting not knowing what exactly is going on. In the mean time, down the other end of the glassed in counter,2 men are leaning over the glass talking to the Female pharmacist. About what I don't know but, they are not in uniform, so I am guessing they do not work there. Another cashier(female) asks me, Have I been helped. Well,yes, and I have paid,but, I do not have my pills and not sure what is going on. She leaves to ask,as now Ryan is also down the other end with the the Pharmacist and the 2 men leaning over the glass portion. One of the men,not in uniform yells down to me, She is changing your pills,it will just be a min. WTF?? People I never say this, but this was the worst customer service ever and it gets better. Who is that guy and why does he have his hand in my dealings??? Ryan comes back and apologizes for going MIA and explains that they had given me the wrong thing. yeah Ryan for catching that for me. So I really do not blame him. I am grateful that he caught it. Then comes the Pharmacist, Alda,Or something similar. She says have my name then I come up to the counter and she starts yelling at the cash register. It just goes on and on,I don't want to bore you with all the details. All I can say is not professional. I did not like the entire episode so I won't be getting any scripts there again. Sorry for so long of a story. But, when it comes to medical of any kind. I want professionalism.",negative
Been coming to this location since I moved to this side of town in 1998. Employees are always glad to help. The pharmacy is quick and gives you calls when your prescription is ready for pick up. I love the fresh produce section that was recently Added this past year. Great selections great prices.,positive
"This Target gets the job done. Their shelves tend to be in a little disarray, and their makeup selections are generally lacking, but other than superfluous purchases I didn't even need to make, this Target has never let me down. The grocery section is probably the cleanest and best in the store. I love perusing these aisles. Their clothing section is pretty diverse, but because the store is somewhat small, it's packed in tight. It's a challenge to maneuver the area. The biggest perk is its central location to southern Tempe. It's also very rarely busy during the day, which is awesome!",positive
"I do not like this target. The team members are unhelpful in helping you find the item that you are looking for. They stand there saying UM we don't carry it, several minuts later I found the Item after the team member flat out lied. After look for my self I found the item. Lazy team member in house wares. TARGET EXPECT LESS, PAY MORE!",negative
"I LOVE TARGET!!!!! Ok, now that I have that out of my system, lets review why I love this one so much. A) its target and they carry everything B) thier awesome C) I want to buy everything in sight, despite the fact that I only came in here to get shampoo D) its organized! Aside from parking, this is one of the better targets around, but the parking sucks here, so beware. Go and shop your heart out...",positive
Ummm Target Rocks. Enough Said. Target is my fav place to go for everything...this location is clean and has a good selection of everything.,positive
Target has pretty dresses in there currently and attractive workout clothes that make me look skinny without even having to work it. 5 star for that !,positive
"who doesn't love a target? i could easily spend $100 if i'm not careful just stopping in for toilet paper or something. i've really been into their clothes, believe it or not. they've got good, nice shirts for work - they look stylish and fit well enough for the price, and you never want to spend a ton on dumb old work clothes anyway. i'll occasionally buy shoes here, only to realize that cheap shoes just hurt your feet, bad idea. not the cheapest place for electronics like TVs, but they have them.",positive
"I come here regularly as it's close to home. Never had an issue with the staff, friendly and helpful. However the store is not always as organized as it could be. On a few occasions I found expired (even molded bread) on the shelves, and the kids section always seems to be a bit messy. I understand customers create part of that mess but the on sale items would be easier to identify if sorted by size.",negative
"Worst Target I've been to and unfortunately it's the closest to me. Long lines at self checkout with 3 employees standing around watching people trying to figure out how to scan and purchase their items and no registers open to actually scan items for their customers. Very frustrating. I'm all about self check out, but when the lines are long and you have that many employees standing around, maybe it's time to open an actual register to help get the line moving. This isn't the first time this has happened while I'm here. After continuously happening, I decided to write a review in hopes this issue will be fixed!",negative
"I love Target over Walmart. I really don't care if it's over priced ill pay for the convince to walk in this clean store and actually be greeted by the Employees. The employees here are always friendly and willing to help you out. They always have great finds on the clearance racks. Also, you never have to wait that long to get checked out.",positive
Targets a joke to return electronics. I have my receipt from a Fitbit bought for me as a gift. Fitbit doesn't work properly and Target won't refund or exchange the item. It's been 2 months. Now I'm going to have to go to the manufacturer. What's the point of buying from Target then? What a pain!,negative
"Not a bad Target. Pretty standard. Clean store, friendly staff. Large selection of winter clearance which I can appreciate because I live in Maryland and can use the scarves, hats, and gloves #winning. Produce appeared fresh, grocery was well stocked.",positive
This is the most dirtiest target ever!!! HOW IN THE HELL DO U HAVE BABY SPIDERS CRAWLING ON THE CLOTHES RACK!!!!!! I'm so appalled I'm just in so much disbelief I can't believe It . You get one star only because my elementary school friend works there,negative
"This target has THE WORST customer service! I'm not sure if it's because it's on the south side of Phoenix, but I have came across very few employees who are helpful or even friendly. One example I was purchasing medela breast pump gift set I grabbed it because online it said it was a certain price I also looked at the tag on the shelf to make sure it was also that same price and it was. Checking out it came up a completely different price. The lady had someone look and they said that was the right price ( meaning they didn't actually check) I told the lady I looked at the tag before picking it up and it was the same price as it says online the lady then tells me well there's nothing I can do you need to go to the customer service desk so they can price match. Another situation, I purchased a set of bottles after bringing it home I noticed water spots in the bottles and weird hole in the nipples. I took them back and told them that there were water spots and the little hole in the nipple and for precautionary measures they shouldn't put the bottles back on the shelves. There were three girls at the customer service desk all that was said was we don't put returned baby products back on the shelf and 18.45 will go back on your card. No customer service ethic what so ever. I hate that I live literally a mile away and it's convenient to come here.",negative
I like this target but the return policy is pretty unfair you pay full price for something and if you don't have a recipe they want to give you less the amount your item is worth?! All I wanted was an exchange my item hadn't even dropped price had all tags and they couldn't just give me the size I wanted. Unfair,negative
I was at Target last Sunday looking for a product and nothing on the shelf in fact very little of the trail mix. There was very little stocked on the shelves for being a Sunday and the new ad coming out.. Also on the floor were price tags just scattered around. I went to the men's department and clothes on the floor and again very little product to chose from.. Made me thing of Walmart. We went to check out and only two lanes open and six to seven people standing in line and a front end manager just standing there looking around.. After complaining they finally opened a couple of Lanes. I hate to say this but this is getting just as bad as Walmart. That being said the Pharmacy is very professional and always provides great customer service unlike the rest of the store.,negative
Customer service sucks here.. What happened to the customer being always right? Buy one get one 50% off signs everywhere yet the 2 items I pick from the women's section is apparently not.. Even when the sign is right above the rack that you got the items from. They weren't even apologetic for the misunderstanding or the inconvenience.. Diane would rather argue instead of create a positive experience for the customer.,negative
"I actually love this Target! I'm a huge fan of Targets in general, but this Target never seems to disappoint. I go for the clearance items and they always have a decent selection in Menswear. You can also find discounts throughout the entire store on the endcaps. There's also a Starbucks that is opened until 10PM inside the Starbucks. This is great if you need that caffeine fix or maybe an overpriced Evolution Smoothie. Let's be honest here.",positive
"This Target is not coupon friendly. There always some workers there trying to come up with their own rule, they aren't following the company policy.",negative
"I am writing this one star review because today on Sunday they open at 8am. Welcome to 2015 target, it's no longer 1950. Open your store earlier!! There is no reason why it can't be open at 7am. Make it happen Target. Until it does happen I'll just be going to stores that are open earlier, Frys, Wal Mart etc.",negative
Terrible customer service.When I w ent to finalize my purchases I got no greeting.Also the lady after me received no greeting.I don't often and wont.,negative
The only draw back I can think of is that at any given time there are only three lanes open. everything else is pretty swell.,positive
"My experience has always been during the day at this Target location. I have never had to wait in long lines or have difficulty finding store staff to help me. The moment you walk in the carts are neatly stacked at the front door. On the left is the customer service booth where there is always someone available to help you including returns. On the right is the dining area. Starbucks on deck and a mini café filled with yummy treats. Then there is the store. Like most Targets everything is neat and in order. The store is laid out just like the rest of them in the valley. This is a good size target that includes a grocery store. Customer service at this location is superb. Everyone is always so willing to help. They will even walk you to the isle to show you were the items you need are. Yes, the hand holding technique is appreciated and makes me spend more.",positive
"This target store is so friendly! The pharmacy and staff are very nice and helpful too! This is my go-to store when I need something quick for the house, car or for my family.",positive
I come to this Target just to avoid the long lines and the ghetto people from Walmart down the street from my house in Laveen since it's the closes one to me. Seems like they're always out of stock on the things that I need now. I used to like coming here but this Target location is starting to become as ghetto as the Walmart in Laveen and the bathroom is disgusting and stinks like crap!! Yuck! I would hold my pee if I was you unless you're a guy and are able to stand up peeing.,negative
I love this store! Always clean and staff is always friendly. It is my favorite place to buy things I don't need. I like to shop the clearance sections at the ends of the aisles. I use the Target Cartwheel app and my Redcard to save even more.,positive
This Target has been my go-to location for quite some time. I have never really had any issues here and anytime I have had to deal with customer service they have always been helpful and accommodating. The layout here is pretty standard and this location is always pretty clean. Pretty middle of the road on this one. Nothing spectacular but nothing bad either. I will continue to come here when I need something they might carry and I will always come here over going to Walmart. That is for sure! PS. I got the red card that is tied to your debit/checking account and outside of initial issues with activation have not had any problems since.,negative
"Probably the best Target store in Arizona. Though not perfect, the employees seem to always ask me if I need help. Great customer service or Guess Service As they say. The Starbuck baritas are great too. Never been to a Target store, that was a bad experience.",positive
"After landing in Phoenix for vacation, one of the first things I did was look up the location of the closest Target so that I could pick up a few necessities. For a Sunday, late morning, the store only had a handful of shoppers. The store was clean and well organized and I was able to find everything that I needed. Cashier was friendly as well.",positive
"Organized, clean. Good selection, reasonable prices. Found Hello Panda cookies in the dollar section upon entrance. Clean bathrooms with energy efficient dryer. Quick or short lines at the register. Overall good service. It's sort of far from the house so we don't go often but when we do it's a good experience. Edit (2017) Had to edit my ""helpful staff"" comment. I went in and spent a fair amount on discount clearance items. Even had a comment from the cashier ""that's a lot"". Everything was scanned while the cashier talked with another worker (who didn't appear to have a task), while another 5 or so workers stood at the end of the 3 or 4 open registers conversing. Everything priced correctly, my coupons went in easily and I paid. I picked up my bags and placed them in my cart, counted and looked back as he began to scan the next person. Assuming I had everything I left and walked to my car to be shortly met with the customers from behind me in line letting me know I left one bag at the cash register. I said thanks and ran back inside to find that the cashier had handed it off to the other worker who had passed me to hand it to another worker who started walking towards the back of the store. I caught up asked if that was my two remaining items I had left at the register, he looked inside the bag and with confirmation handed it to me. Not quit sure when customer service stopped trying to return items to their purchaser but that's not cool. Especially with 5 or 6 additional workers hanging out near the register who could have gone outside and tried to get the bag to me or taken the items to customer service in anticipation that I'd return to ask about them. Some effort on the part of the employee's would be great. Prices are still great for the items I needed and store is still pretty much the same otherwise.",negative
"Seriously? 1 star because they won't cannibalize a piece off of a BBQ grill from a floor model for you, right then and there. And, oh yeah, you bought it there 4 months ago ... and I'm sure you brought the receipt. /shaking my head in wonderment/ This Target (""Our Target"") is a wonderful store. Yes, we've had a problem with an employee once or twice. If you go anywhere long enough you will always run into the bad apple, or that person that is just having a bad day. Overall, very nice people. I hate waiting in lines (that's why we don't go to K-Mart any more) ... most of the time we only have to wait a couple of people in line, and the checkers always seem to move the people right along. The pharmacy over the years has had a variety of staff, but they all have been pleasant and helpful. Some we even got to the point where they knew us as we walked up. We've used there Service Desk numerous times as well over the years. Never had anything but a friendly reception and quick service. So Kristen C ... I agree with you.",positive
"It only took me one, extremely bad experience with this store to make me a NON-customer forever. I had bought a BBQ grill there. nice 3 burner gas grill with the optional burner for heating up whatever in a saucepan on the side. I had had the thing something like 4 months. On a certain day, I was hosting a huge party and yes, that included cooking everything on the grill. About half an hour before the party was to start, I went to fire up the grill. Nothing happened. I check the tank - I had just had it filled. It was the valve on the hose that hooks up to the tank that had failed. I raced down to the Target figuring they would have a replacement part, they did not. I asked them if I could just take one off a display model, I had a party, it was starting in 15 minutes, please help me. The employee would not help, at all. I called for store management and the store's general manager came out. I told him my plight, guests were already arriving (I was getting calls on my cell phone), I need the part and I needed it now, please please please help me out with this! The store's general manager absolutely REFUSED to help me with it, saying I would have to bring the entire grill back and exchange the thing for a new one!!!! He had NO heart, at all!! This guy was as cold as a car's engine sitting on a hill slope in the middle of winter in Siberia: good luck getting it running much less warmed up! I freely admit after practically begging the man for a part off a floor model and him absolutely refusing to do ANYTHING to help me at all, I cussed him out, quite well I must add. I ran out of that store and remembered there is an ACE hardware a couple of doors down. Thank God they had a gas metering thing, whatever the thing is called. I paid $20 or so for it and back home I went Grill fired right up and I got the party rolling. But, it wasn't that I had to spend money to get the thing fixed, though the grill was still under warranty, it was the extremely calloused attitude and replies I got from that store's general manager. It wouldn't have been the end of the world for that guy to give me the part I needed and just get another one sent from their DC. I make it a point to bad-mouth that store after that experience with them anytime the subject of going to that place comes up!",negative
"I absolutely despise this Target. Every single time I go in there they are out of stock on half of the items I need. Last time I was looking for something specific (over the door mirror), I looked on line and it said they were in stock, I called the store, they then confirmed they were in stock. I get to the store (I live 5 minutes away) ... Yep not one in stock. Another experience went like this.. Bought $300 worth of crap, get home and the dog food containers I purchased (which says so on my receipt) are not there. I call and they ask me to recall what register I was at. Is this on the receipt? No. How the hell am I supposed to remember... They then tell me they will look around and if they see them I can come back and get them. No one ever called... When I called back they told me to come in. When I went in the manager argued with me ""Are you sure"" blah blah... It took 2 calls and 3 hours of my time to get the 2 dog food containers I paid $8 bucks each for. I'm glad others are having better experiences here, but for me this Target sucks.",negative
"I second Kristin's nomination of this Target as the best Target ever! It's a super-clean and well-stocked location, and the staff is definitely really friendly and helpful. Every time I've gone, I've had employees ask me if I needed help finding anything, and today, when I had a full cart and left my wallet in the car, one of the team members offered to watch my cart while I ran out to the car. It also has a Starbucks inside, which is a huge plus for those Saturday or Sunday morning trips!",positive
"I have the Best-est Target EVER! Ok, maybe not EVER. But the best one in Phoenix. So THERE Scottsdale! In a strip mall (but of course) but it's a very pretty one! Just south of South Mountain Community College, the center has some cool walking/meditating garden area between itself and the school. Not a bad spot to eat some ice cream or lunch either but that's a review of a different color. So - my wonderful Target. We had wine before everyone else's Target. We have a rocking $1 section that must RISE to the level the store, not sink to it as some seem to do... Pretty nice clothing/shoes section! I've found things shown here that I don't see at any of the other locations. (Got myself a matching suit jacket and pants for under $50 that I'm complimented on regularly! LOVE Target!) Even at Christmas time, the Toy section was VERY well maintained. Their seasonal section is at the back as most of the new ones are, and the only time I saw it a bit messy was when the day after Halloween when they were removing the scraps of costumes that were left to make way for Christmas stuff. The outdoor area is really big! From rakes to plants to fountains - this location has things that I haven't seen in other stores. And then - the Freezer section. The wall along the outdoor section is a giant section of frozen meals, single or family sized, including good vegetarian & Ethnic options as well as ice cream, appetizers and pretty much anything else you can imagine would be frozen. A refrigerated section w/ milk and eggs too. In front of that there is a decent sized ""grocery"" section w/ canned/boxed/packaged food stuffs. Yes, other Target stores may have these things too but a) My store's stuff is bigger and/or better b) It's MY Target! It's like kids. Yes, you may have beautiful children, but I'll never think they are as beautiful as mine - kind of a thing. Oh yea, full Starbucks and a separate lunch counter area that offers your standard pizza/nacho/popcorn/sandwich/icee options. It really is the best one ever. Ever.",positive
Always when I come here I am never disappointed. The staff are really friendly and always there for you. The self checkout system is really amazing if you want to use it. The washrooms are really clean and they have a wide selection of electronics. The style of their furniture is good.And I like there up&up brand. Target may not have the prices like Walmart but they have the quality. Price does not always matter at the end of the day. What matters is are you willing to pay the price for what your buying?Is it good quality?Will it last long?(Does not apply for grocery) Well done Target!,positive
"I don't know what people mean by all the complaints about Target with empty shelves and terrible pricing! I love coming here, maybe a bit too much. I find they have a well curated selection of all sorts of green and organic products, and staff seem pretty friendly. Their homeware selection is also fantastic and very affordable. Also, everything is very well lit, and things are really tidy in this store. I will definitely be back again!",positive
"Big, clean, cheap and has a good variety and selection of items that other places like Wal-mart don't. I love it so much more because i can buy everything i need at one place. Their combat boots are sturdy and cute, the school supplies section is stacked and has great deals, the employees are a little over eager but very helpful and overall, i just really love this location. Starbucks is in store, too, so that's a plus.",positive
"Toronto's newest Tarjay. A real gem. This is a larger one, I feel like its buyers are better here than the one in the east end. It isn't just like a Walmart. OK clothes, furniture and party supply sections. What are you waiting for? Go here, grab a Starbucks and a cart and play American while picking up some cheap summer crap. PEPPER POINTS for their swell Toronto Blue Jays section. Let's go Blue Jays *clap clap clap clap clap.*",positive
"If you can ever get over the fact that this is a big box store that is both non-Canadian and possible competition (I.e. Something that might make other stores sweep, evaluate their prices, or ask their employees to bathe) for some other stores in the area, you might like Target. The negatives here are navigating the entrance on the ground floor, and the fact that it is a big box store with big box type customer service. Beyond that... 1. It's shiny, new, and neat. The place makes Canadian Tire look like a thrift store. 2. Everything is displayed well. It is easy to find things here. No clutter. 3. The grocery selection is limited, but features major brands you expect at great prices. 4. They have a good selection of nicer brands throughout the store. Once the entire Stockyards development is finished, shopping here will be even better .",positive
"We dealt with Alyson in the customer service department and she went above and beyond to help us. We were returned a defective product and the store didn't have a replacement for us in at the moment or on the way. She helped us out by finding something to fit our needs before we left the store. My husband, daughter and I were very pleased with her service and continued to shop throughout the store afterwards. Very happy with our experience and will be returning for all our shopping needs. Thanks Alyson!",positive
"Used to live within walking distance of this store and did a ton of shopping here. Still do. Great selection, great prices. Use the Target/Cartwheel app for better deals on almost everything.",positive
"Always clean, always stocked. Customer service is friendly. They need to add more cashiers, it seems like I'm always in a long line, but the cashiers themselves are friendly.",positive
"I shop here regularly, sometimes picking up an internet order. Never had an issue until now. On December 27th I placed an order to be picked up at this store. It took until January 5th to get the item to the store, nine days. On the 5th, I received an email, late in the day telling me the ordered arrived and I had till Sunday ( two days) to pick it up. I was tied up most of the weekend, but there was a place on their web site to request additional pick up time. Problem is it didn't work. Started a chat with CS, they said order was already canceled. The store wasn't even closed yet. They wanted me to call another number to see what could be done. I had been on hold for a rep for 8 minuets and spent another 15 minutes. I told the rep it appears Target wants this item more than I do.Later I tried to send an email to express my frustration to them. No way to send an email, only phone/chat. Not interested in waiting in line again. With retail stores getting pummeled by Amazon, rigid policies and avoiding contact with customers is just dumb. I spend a lot of money at Target each year, well I used to anyway. So long .",negative
"Oh how I love the super targets. Bigger can be better. They have limited staff, but I always use the you scan for price checks or paging someone if I need them for assistance which is rare.They always come running when I do the page... literally have you ever tried it?! No matter the time of day someone sprints to the phone to help. It's in a shopping development with other places and there is a limited entrance and exit. Whosever did the architecture lost me on this one. Clearly there is a demand and god forbid there was a real emergency ppl would be stuck. Anyway, the store is clean and items are fresh. The staff are friendly and the prices are nice. Great place. So why isn't every target a super target?!",positive
"I have been loving Target since the 80s while living in CA, my go to store. There were no Walmarts there at the time. Moved here in 92 to WHAT NO CLOSE TARGET?! When we finally got it I was so psyched. It's such a nicer experience entirely than WM. It's quieter, the shopping carts don't even make noise rolling along. All the employees are so nice and helpful but not intrusively so. The merchandise - can always count on Target to have something different and exciting, unlike WM. I am a person who generally hates shopping, but at Target it's a genuine pleasure. The store is always neat and orderly, the aisles are wide and not cramped and I love the way they have the produce laid out. I have only rarely not been able to find what I was looking for. Awesome store!!",positive
"So what can I say that so many others haven't about Target? I can tell you that with my near daily visits to this place (I live literally right behind the store) that I've really gotten to know everyone here and most I have become good friends with. An outstanding customer experience every visit! This store is one of the most well kept in the area. It seems that the Mooresville store becomes a zoo and it's hard to keep a zoo in order. Huntersville has major crowds as well and it doesn't help that it is a considerably smaller store with limited perishables like Produce (and not a deli to speak of). When you step back and watch how the employees operate, they work as a team and keep a 'guest-first' attitude while stocking or making aisles or displays look presentable. My favorite part about this store is the fact that their produce section is very open, clean, and well stocked with a good selection. You go to some locations and the produce is tucked into a corner and it seems as though one person is working half the store. Not here, I've always been able to find a friendly associate to help me if needed. There are some speciality perishables I have to go to Harris Teeter for, but 95% of the time it is a convenient stop on my way home. Their 5% off with a RedCard combined with Cartwheel (google it if you're unfamiliar) can save you a ton of money if you're a Target loyal. Ask a cashier or the customer service desk as they have debit and credit options. I definitely applaud the management team here, as attitude always reflects leadership and you can tell they run a tight ship.",positive
"This is your average super target, they have what you want and the lines are short. I love that there is plenty of parking and it's close to 85. One thing I would recommend is that they hire more employees. If you can't find something or need help, you're out of luck. Overall, it's a good store. I was surprised at the meat selection; a lot of good stuff. I will definitely be going back",positive
"Not at all impressed with this Target. I've been shopping at this Target for the past 4 years and it hasn't gotten any better. The lines are always so very long, they have very few cashiers. This Store is the dirtiest Target I've ever been to. The produce is always awful!! And oh my the expired items!! : / They do not take their expired items off the shelves, maybe employees slacking off not sure but it's awful!! It seems they just push the expired items in the back instead of taking them off the shelves. I have literally found 6 month to 1 year expired items at this store!! I use to accidentally purchase expired items from there often and would have to take them back. Now I have to take the time to check everything!! I've even found meat that is expired!!! I only keep going here because I don't have many other options. Hoping it gets better!!",negative
I came to target to pick up a steak and some McCormick steak seasoning for dinner. The store was changed around since the last time I came here. The shelves were well stocked and neat and the store was impeccably clean! The only drawback was there was none on the floor to ask a question. The one person I saw in a red target shirt was in a rush to take his lunch break and moving pretty fast so I dare not get in his way! After a few minutes I was able to locate everything on my list. Stop cutting back on employees and put some people on the floor Target!,negative
"First of all I love all Targets. But I especially love this one. Well stocked, organized, friendly staff and great clearance sections (and normal sales). Whenever I come home to Charlotte this is always the Target I head to. The store is located in a large strip mall that has other stores (dollar store, Marshalls, Sally's Beauty..) so you can easily bounce around from store to store, though I usually never need to since Target has EVERYTHING. What I like most about this Target is their great grocery section - tons of varieties for each product and lots of Target brand (Market Pantry) items. The clothing section is also pretty big and I always find something to buy. Great store, dangerous for my wallet",positive
"I love this target! I can always fine what I need here! I stop in all the time on my way home from Charlotte to Salisbury. They have the best selections. Of course Target is a little pricier than other Department Stores but you really do pay for quality there most of the time. I love their selections for Home decorating. You can really find some unique and creative things in all colors. They also have a really nice plus size selection. And it's really current and well made clothing. Now most general groceries, I don't buy from here, because I can usually get it somewhere else cheaper. But when I'm looking for unique selections that cater to a certain diet or lifestyle, this is the place I go!",positive
"Everything for an amazing shopping experience is here. It is no wonder I love Target! Simple, interactive gift registry, no hassle returns. Friendly, efficient customer service. Great sale prices and they often have harder to find items here. Did I mention fantastic home decor. Cute clothes and killer clearance items. It is also pretty easy to find an associate when you need help. It's true... The love affair deepens with every visit. Having said that, you can get one bad manager who ruins your entire shopping experience. Which is what happened here today, which resulted in poor customer service. Anyone can have a bad day, which is what I hope is all the issue was here. Often the lines could be shorter. There is rarely anyone at the jewelry counter, and the prices are not Walmart. But this is Target and I love it.",positive
"Clean and neat, the store is well kept and enjoyable to shop at. The lines are always short, which is nice, but the customer service is right in line with about everywhere else's, nothing exceptional",positive
"Best Selection around. My wife has already started Christmas shopping and bought camera's for two of the Granddaughter's. No stores have more than one of the hardshell camera cases that she wanted. After several other stores and three Targets, we tried this one and found exactly what we wanted. Store is well stocked, sales people are great and knowledgable about their merchandize and pricing is very reasonable. I really like this particular store and even though others are closer to where I live, will be shopping here more often.",positive
"It has taken me a few visits (so?!) to fig out exactly what makes this Target indeed super to me: It has a deli. The deli sells many ready-to-eat items including baked goods, salads, wraps, snack packs, etc. The items that are sold from this area are usually pretty fresh. There is also a Jamba Juice, Starbucks and optical center within. It contains a full grocery department (yay!) My only gripe w/ this location is that there is oftentimes a battle for carts! If you visit during peak times good luck scavenging for a shopping cart, ha! Since this is Super Target, they tend to have a greater selection in every department than a regular Target will have (i.e. way too much stuff to peruse;-) Obviously, this location is pretty massive. Sometimes I intentionally get lost in here. As typical of Target, service is usually efficient. Yes, this is ""as good as it gets"" for a Target! Needless to say, this is definitely my favorite Target :-)",positive
"Oh ya! Taaaaaaaaaarget. I love the location, sometimes I would just go here to avoid sitting in traffic. I always spend forever in here. I think the employees are a little leery of me because I come so often. But I love it! I use the Pharmacy but the rewards aren't great anymore so I have since changed locations. The staff is pretty nice though but price is king. I love that Target sends out coupons that I can actually use from time to time. The prices are a higher on some things that most stores but its not as stressful as going to Walmart.",positive
"This isn't just Target. It's Super Target. But really - the lines are totally blurred, aren't they? You have your average Target, where you can find some general grocery items, such as non-perishable items. And you get your slightly larger Target, where you might even find some perishable (refrigerated) items. I guess that's the somewhat-Super Target. But then you get the really large Target, and that's what is makes it Super. Or maybe it is the Jamba Juice in the lobby. Overall, I didn't really find their grocery section that amazing. They had a ton of samples, which you don't usually find at, say, the Super Wal-Mart (or whatever it is called). Unfortunately they were all empty. So the people of Afton Ridge are really a bunch of sample-hungry freaks or Target just puts out the sample plates but never fills them. Who knows? What I really thought was awesome was their specials, especially the meat. Picked up some boneless chicken thighs for $2 (something like $1.60 per pound). And ground buffalo (probably bison, but it said buffalo) was for an awesome price too. They don't have a great produce section - so if you want that you would be better at Super Wal-Mart or, even better, Lowe's Foods. But there are some deals to be had if you look for them.",negative
TRC provides top notch service and the best menswear selection in North Carolina. The gentlemen here know everything there is to know about professional and casual men's fashion ranging from Italian style to southern looks. Highly recommend you go here if you have the wallet for it and want to impress anyone you meet.,positive
"Nice selection of higher end clothing. Staff are eager to help you find the style and size that you need. It is pricey, but they do have nice clothing and personal service that set them apart from larger stores.",positive
"Thank God you guys are here, smaller and more personal than Neiman's but, actually has a better curated selection for men",positive
"Hands down, the best men's clothier in Charlotte. TRC carries casual wear to upscale suiting in high quality brands that are modern yet classic. The service cannot be matched.",positive
"Top-notch personal service and exquisite men's and women's fashion apparel. If you're not on a budget, you can't go wrong with Taylor, Richards, and Conger. Plus, the relocated Charlotte outpost of noted fashion designer Billy Reid is at TRC. Highly recommended, but bring your credit cards.",positive
"I was helped by Chessi today. She made my day by helping me find out that I'm not as fat as I think I am, and found my the perfect pair of jeans. Thanks for not giving up on me. GREAT SERVICE! Thank you again!",positive
"Yeah... its trendy and cliche'. Of course it is... Its The Buckle. BUT... they also have great customer service, and rarely do I come in and NOT find exactly what I was looking for to begin with. Sam is the best (Jeb is out at Clackamas now, I think). I usually call ahead and let Sam shop for me. She grabs whatever I have told her I am looking for, in my size (Or my son, or my daughter... depending on our visit and whats needed) and has a room set up for me when I arrive. I cant tell you how much I love this since I hate to shop... it is the BEST thing ever!!",positive
WOW. I went here after the worst experience at Tilly's next door. Chance the sales guy that helped me out was awesome. Thank you for knowing how to treat customers.,positive
"I can't tell you how many time I've walked in here to get a new pair of rock revivals, but I haven't been asked once if I need help or even a welcome to the store. Going to stick with paradise valley buckle for now on.",negative
"I absolutely loved this store in Glendale. The Buckle store where I live, (Alderwood Mall WA) has horrible customer service. The girls that work there are super stuck up, they almost treat you like crap if you don't have a fake tan, bleached blonde hair... I have gotten to the point that I will NEVER return to the Buckle at my mall. While being on vacation in Glendale, I went to the one at Arrowhead Towne Ctr. Great customer service, the staff were super kind, welcoming and they really tried to talk to us, asking us where we were from and all that. My husband and myself were very pleased with how they treated us, considering how much we hate going to our store. I will never forget the great experience that the Glendale Buckle gave us. If I could, I would ONLY shop at this store. Thank you to the couple of guys that helped me find my awesome jeans. Thank you for not treating us like crap and like we were just another wallet to be opened at your store.",positive
My fiancé and I came in the other day to find him some new jeans and we received great help from Ryan. He was very attentive and was willing to help him find his size while folding the ones he did not like. This location is very nice and the staff has always been very friendly.,positive
This store staff & management were horrendous!! I went in with a few things to switch sizes. That's all just get a different size. Char kept trying to get me to purchase other jeans... My items were gifts & I just needed smaller/bigger sizes. Left without anything changed & an hour wasted in my day!! Won't shop there ever again!!,negative
"Jeans here are of the highest quality! Free alterations make it even better! If you lack style or have a difficult time finding that appealing look, it's probably because you haven't shopped here! Love this place!",positive
"This is our (me and my wife) go-to place for jeans and they have great fitted shirts too, very casual. Don't expect to spend less than $100 on jeans but you will look good in them. They do have a store line brand called BKE that are little less costly and still look good....Levi's don't have a chance here so don't bother wearing them into the store. The place is pretty large with a good selection. Service is the best I have ever seen, we always get great help and always buy more than we planned on and even buy things that we would never try on unless the salesperson pushed it on me. I should start calling this place ""Costco"" since I cant walk in without spending at least $300 and a few trips with my wife cost me much more. I actually stayed away for about a year before going back last week. Service and selection has not changed, the salesperson always walks around the counter to hand you your bag and shake your hand.",positive
"When it comes to fitting denim over your hips and shaping your butt out the way you need a pair of jeans to do, it's marvelous to have the staff willing to throw you whatever size and style you need while you are ziping and buttoning and turning, and admiring yourself in the mirror of a 5 by 5 dressing room. I give every buckle I've ever been to 5 stars because every time I go into one, the staff drops everything to help me out. And what I like even more, is that the same staff memeber rings you up, so you don't have to try to remember the name of the person helping you. I'm not the biggest fan of the prices of their clothes.. but really, I will wear the crap out of everything I buy from there, so the value pairs well with the price. From my first experience to my last, this store has been consistent, helpful, friendly, and.. expensive. But whatever, I'll go back in a heartbeat.. i think they are getting their shorts in soon.. yay!",positive
"This is a great place to find furniture to repurpose. My wife buys a ton of stuff here. However the ""antique store"" next-door is a bunch of bologna. I guess there's a sucker born every minute. The Squirrley little guy who works there is sort of annoying too, not very friendly and definitely shouldn't be allowed to deal with customers. I find better stuff on the other side.",positive
"Excellent place to furnish a new apartment for someone new in town. I moved to town in August and bought a 7ft couch ($50), large desk ($40), and nice office chair ($30) here. Best part: they deliver! I drive a small car and had no way to haul everything to my second-floor apartment let alone move it up the stairs myself. They charge $20 to deliver the first piece and $5 for each additional piece, so my total was $30 delivery. TOTALLY worth it, as the 7ft couch was heavy as hell and barely fit through my door. Thank goodness for those delivery guys. Oh, and I also found DOWN couch pillows with removable (aka washable) covers here for $2 each!! If your furniture needs aren't urgent, I would recommend stopping by frequently and waiting for good finds. The other day I saw 8 dark red wood office desks for sale at $50 each, all *very* nice and probably go for ten times that price retail. Some local office must have donated them, and I'm sure they were snatched up in a matter of days. To save on delivery fees, you can purchase something, tag your name to it, and leave it there for up to two weeks before scheduled delivery, and you can shop around for other furniture pieces in the meantime to combine into one delivery.",positive
"This is the best place to go thrifting! Not only is the selection great, but it's convenient location means that you can stop in on your way downtown or home from work and that it's close enough to campus that walking, biking, or busing between class or on lunch isn't out of the question. It's got an expansive selection of hardware, furniture, gardening, and kitchen supplies! The best time to shop is definitely August since that's when there's a lot of shuffling going on with leases ending and students moving away. By the end of August though, things are usually picked pretty clean since new students moving in definitely know to stop in here. I've bought many of my kitchen appliances here for a fraction of the price you'd spend at a department store! AND it supports a good cause! A win for everyone! The only thing they don't sell are clothes but that's fine, there are plenty of places to shop for second hand clothes in town. It's nice to find a place that does the ""everything else"". Also, the employees aren't always that helpful but most of them are volunteers so I would keep that in mind when they're not enthusiastically assisting your every whim. While this means that most of the employees aren't the most helpful, it also means that there's always that random one that's SUPER passionate about helping you find stuff. I've had someone go to the back to bring out boxes of freshly delivered VHS tapes just to help me find the one I was looking for!",positive
"I went to the ReStore looking for some furniture for my apartment -- way better selection than I expected. They have not one, but three floors! The ground level is dedicated to large pieces: couches, dining room sets, entertainment stands, chairs, electronics. The basement is dedicated to DIY supplies, small appliances, and sporting equipment: raw building materials, doors, window frames, filing cabinets, skis, bikes, bowling balls, shelving units, microwaves, washers, dryers, etc. The top floor is reserved for glassware, art, lamps, and linens. I found an amazing coffee table and quiet, high-quality filing cabinet for $40 total. Highly recommend.",positive
"Store review: Yes this is better than the goodwill or salvation army stores in Champaign due to a large selection of furniture and a constantly rotation stock of merchandise. This was my first time visiting a Habitat for Humanity store. I still have not bought anything from these stores before, but this place was super busy on the Saturday morning. The first floor has a small section for electronics, mainly old CRT TVs and other random electronics. They have many desk, tv stands, chairs at very good prices. Depending on your luck I can see how you can make off with a very good deal. The chairs themselves were very old and I could not see myself buying a used recliner. The basement has tons of hardware material well organized. On the second floor is home goods. Lots of the merchandise on this floor is very very old. Overall if you like second hand goods this would be your store. FYI there is no clothes at this store. Pros: cheap second hand furniture if you are on a budget Cons: very old merchandise Hidden deals: The whole store is a hidden deal, just look around",negative
"I like to go here occasionally and just see what they have. In the past, I've found several good books here as well as some fabrics and crafts and linens that I've torn up and made into yarn. The atmosphere is warm and the people are friendly. The prices are very reasonable. Some of the stuff can be a bit run down but I'm willing to look through it to find some treasures.",positive
"This is the best home thrift store in Champaign. The employees are really friendly and helpful, popcorn for the kids (which is a helpful tool when I'm trying to shop in peace) and great items with great prices. Most of my living room is furnished from items purchased at ReStore. Also the manager is a really friendly guy and is always helpful. Furniture delivery is only $20! Which is less than I would have spent to rent a truck from Home Depot which would also have cost me the, plus I have to load and unload it myself, etc. I am truly in love with this place.",positive
"Any time you are planning a trip to Home Depot or Lowe's, you should check out the ReStore first. Odds are, they'll have what you're looking for at a fraction of the price, and you'll be doing the earth a favor by buying it used instead of new. The basement level has all the home depot-esque items, from pieces of wood to paint to hoses to tools and so much more. The main level has tons of used household furniture including couches, dressers, chairs, tables, etc. as well as electronics like TVs, and then upstairs you'll find all the normal thrift store finds like framed art, dishes, and various odds & ends. The upstairs part is comparable to Goodwill's housewares section, but the furniture selection here is way better. All in all, it's a gold mine. Like a gold mine, you have to be willing to dig through the dirt a little, and probably clean your finds once you get them home, but it's well worth it.",positive
"One of my favorite thrift stores. It definitely has that auction-y thrill of grabbing what you want quick (before it's gone). The selection of housewares is great, and there is almost always something there that fits my taste. The prices are reasonable, but once when I found something that was definitely overpriced, I was told that I shouldn't argue with the prices, as the money goes to charity. I can't argue with that, but it did keep me from buying the item. Knowing Habitat, though, it was gone by the end of the day. :)",positive
"Great place to search for furniture and such if you're looking to decorate your place on a budget. We got a nice 3-headed swivel lamp for $10 (although we later found that 1 of the lamps only kind of works), a practically new super comfortable computer chair for $15 and some miscellaneous dishes for 25 cents each. We were really looking for a couch, and they certainly have quite the selection. Some of them were really good deals, others seemed strangely expensive considering the condition (over $100 for a worn out couch?). Granted, I'm no furniture expert so maybe they really were super awesome couches despite being kind of grungy. We actually did find a couch we wanted (cheap, comfortable, and clean were our criteria), but it had already been claimed by the time we got back around to it. If you're seriously interested in a piece of furniture, remove the price tag and hold onto it until you're ready to check out. Apparently that's the way things work here, although my boyfriend and I had no idea of this ""policy"" until it was too late and a staff member explained it to us. Apparently they get tons of new couches in constantly, so we'll be back to check out the selection in a week or so. Another cool thing is that they offer delivery service. I believe the cost was $20 for the first item, delivered to the first floor, and an additional fee per item. Needless to say, we won't be moving a couch with my sedan, so we're happy about the delivery service and will absolutely be taking advantage of it once we find the couch of our dreams.",positive
"My favorite thrift store. They often have great finds, and I have often passed things up to see them being resold on 'ol Craigslist. I feel one of the best aspects of the store compared to other charity stores is there is no clothing = more room for building supplies, furniture, kitchenware, books etc.",positive
"I LOVE this place! If you're either diligent or lucky, you can find some truly great things. And if you're creative and imaginative, you're really in for a treat--a thrifter/diy'er paradise for sure. Their stuff is way better than Goodwill, and lower priced. Plus, they have everything arranged so well it's easy to find what you're looking for. Policies: ""Technically* they can't help you carry stuff to your car, but they usually will, and they hold stuff for 3 days. $5 minimum cred. card purchase, but you can make a donation as part of your purchase (say you have $4.39 purchase, you can make a 61 cent donation). Examples of past purchases: giant antique gold framed mirror - $30 1800's windsor chair with bamboo legs - $10 (worth $300) large turkish style vase - $5 matching antique gold framed floral prints - $5",positive
"I don't know how this place has 5 stars. It is really depressing inside and everything is torn or broken. I don't want to knock the charity work that Habitat is doing, but I would never come to this store to buy something. The only use I can see for it is that you literally have NO money but absolutely need whatever they have here. They have a large selection of furniture but most of it did not seem in great condition. I really wanted to like this place but I just couldn't.",negative
"Wonderful, high quality furniture at affordable prices. Really helpful staff. Why drive all the way up to IKEA when you can get amazing furniture here? I bought a beautiful dark wood bookcase and chest of drawers. My friend got a cute little 70's green chair and a table. The stock is always rotating so come often to find the best things!!",positive
"I have now fully committed myself to recycling, at every level I can think of, including home furnishings. Last week, I bought the most hideous day bad that was clearly handmade and in need of a woman's touch. For $50 and a five dollar can of stain, I turned it into an HGTV masterpiece. I used two old IKEA curtains that I had and recovered the cushions. Now, this player is most definitely hated. It's the perfect little sofa for my library. That's the kind of magic that the ReStore has to offer.",positive
"Formerly known as HOMEWORKS, Habitat for Humanity moved and renamed their Home Store a few blocks east on University Avenue (inside what used to be the Salvation Army). Plenty of reasonably priced items to purchase to furnish, decorate, establish or refurbish your home. They carry donated painting supplies, roofing, nuts n bolts, couches, foam board, mattresses, books, jars and even sometimes a Wurlitzer Organ. If you can't find what you want, ask an employee to write your name and contact information on their ""Wish List"" - if and when it comes in, they'll call you! For a small fee, they'll deliver it right to your home. Or! If you have something to donate, they will come by and take it off your hands. I've seen local companies donate floor mattresses, model furniture, etc... I even bought myself a couch that was definitely underpriced @ $90. The delivery guy told me it was brand spankin' new and worth at least $300. When I move, I plan on donating it back to ReStore to keep the community love going since all proceeds go to the local Habitat for Humanity home building projects in Champaign County. When you shop or donate to the ReStore you also help build a new home for a local family in need. Now that's smart shopping.",positive
"I had wonderful service at the Macleod store. We purchased some appliances that Raj.helped us with. He bent over backwards for us and got us the best price,and cared about us. Our experience was great with Raj,we will be back,and I recommend Home Depot and Raj.to others.",positive
"I don't normally write reviews but had to highlight the poor customer service experienced today at the Home Depot Macleod Trail SW location. I went to pick a trimmer where the particular model I wanted was not on the shelf but the website indicated having 10 in stock at the Chinook location. After waiting 10 minutes for assistance, an employee from another department recommended I check with the Customer Service desk. The lady at the Customer Service counter was of no help. First she insisted I return to the Outdoor Power Equipment section but when I mentioned that I was already there and an employee had referred me to her, she then gave me the run-around. First she advised that although the computer said they have stock on hand sometimes it's not the case, product can be stolen. Then she advised the trimmer I'm after is available at their North Hills location in the NW. I suspected she was lying so left the store, went online using my cellphone and ordered the trimmer on their website for store pickup at the Chinook location. Within the hour I was back at the Customer Service desk picking up the trimmer. I give Home Depot 5 stars for their store pickup service but zero stars for their employees who will lie to your face and give you the run-around, especially those in Customer Service. I have been a loyal customer for years but after this experience will now shop elsewhere for my hardware needs.",negative
Don't be influenced by the feigned interest displayed in their comment to my review. I sent all of the requested information to them and I heard nothing and they did nothing. Definitely worth zero stars.,negative
"I had a tile install done from Home depot 3 months ago. Advance floooring is only contractor who are hired for home depot and they are all trying to scam us and they came back atleast 5 to 6 times after me requesting them everytime . Amy was the one who gave messages to Tim quality assurance manager. But he never returned my phone calls. and I was the one who requested and no one followed up with me. All the time i had to call them, and followup with them. Home depot and Advance flooring was extremely unhelpful and blamed everything on us we used the solution incorrectly which is not true. Here is my story. 1) Advance flooring : 1st time - Representative name was shawn, he mentioned that he has never do full feature wall install and only has done back splashes, he also said that cleaning has to done by the customer only. It is not in the contract. I paid more than 5000 of my hard earned money and no one could help me. After the wall was done. There was no shine on the natural stone ceramic tile. And when we asked shawn from Advance flooring that the how can we make this look the way we bought the natural stone. He said to use stone sealer and enhancer. 2) Home depot: We went to north hill home depot and spend another $150 and representative named was billy. And he mentioned us and told us to use the instructions. To use the stone enhancer and th use the grout sponge and from other side and dry it out. Also he did mention that once it is dried it should look fine . But it left the haze behind. Now dwayne who is Asm of home depot chinook is mentioning 8000 more to fix the problem and blaming us that you did n follow the instructions properly, which is not true, because i did First they tell us to clean by ourself. We are the customer, we do not know ABC of tile installation. Thats why we spent a lot of money but they are the one who is responsible for tile installlation. They say in tile contract only basic installation is covered not cleaning. And when Tim came in, he mentioned that it is not in a contract to completely clean. What are we paying them money for. Tim also said home depot should pay us more and amend the contract. But customers do have expectations to make sure the job is done to its perfection. They did not level the tiles properly. Its their responsibility, if they come in back and orth after cleaning wait for 3 days amd then polish if needs to dry come back. But they dont do anything liike that. We have been on the phone back and forth with home depot almost three months now,and still my problem is not fixed. My wife feet was cut and still we went physically to home depot chinook yesterday morning and told Dwayne, we are not paying anything extra. As there have been too much frustration with all this and we followed exact intructions given by home depot. He said that you ve to pay half money again. And also said that whatever you want to do any complaint to consumer court. Thats your right to do, but they do not want to help us. So he mentioned to me that Mark T who is the head of installation from western canada will be getting back to you and no one helped us. This is Worst experiencewith home depot chinook and advance flooring. Please dont waste your money with home depot chinook and advance flooring. Super rude and unprofessional company, who does not beleive in giving Exceptional customer service reviews. They are lots of people who are disappointed with flooring and tile installation, what are they giving warrinties if they cannot back up with their word.",negative
I just left and am sitting in the parking lot seething. Went through self checkout and after I had scanned everything through the attendant came over and asked how I was doing while blatantly staring into my bag never once making eye contact. Will no longer drag my brown ass across town to be treated like a criminal.,negative
"This store has reasonable stock levels but the friendly staff lack leadership. I was overcharged at their 16 Ave store and they agreed to refund me to the correct price. But when I objected to their pricing on cable I was referred to their chief cashier and their on duty manager, Mark. Mark was less helpful than his staff and kept referring to ""policy"". They are ""not allowed to deal with concerns from a different store"". I see a theme in the other comments on the site. They lack empowerment and the only time they show customer service is when their staff go out on a limb. It's Rona for me in the future.",negative
I go to home depot quite often and find this locaton is one of the best if you want to make sure they will have all the items you need. Other locations ive breen to sometimes dont have evrything in stock. They have a very convenient tool rentl as well. The store is busy aftersupper and especially on saturdays. Durrinfg the day on wekdays is ussully good. Very helpfull workers and lots of checkouts. Location is on 2 very busy streets intersecting but no problem in and out. Another rhing that isvery interestimng is that they aso rent tractors and diggers etc . Cool,positive
"My last visit to The Home Depot was to get a basic lumber load and get it cut, nothing special. Getting there was easy enough as it's conveniently located on the corner of Macleod Trail and Glenmore, opposite Chinook Centre. Parking was ample and there were plenty of trolleys/carts for items. Inside the aisles are clearly categorized and labeled, but when you actually go down an aisle the organization isn't always clear and they can also be somewhat cluttered/messy. Even in something like lumber, it wasn't clear why things were placed where they were. Finding what I needed was simple enough and I loaded it by myself onto a trolley. I couldn't help but notice that no one was around to help, the whole area was basically barren and the majority of the employees had congregated around the front of the store and were standing around or chatting. Pretty surprising that they don't have more people roaming the floor to actively help people, I could see a lot of customers waiting around and getting frustrated and just leaving because of it. Not only that, but not all customers are equipped to be pulling items off the shelf and loading them. I couldn't help but notice an older man struggle with his load, so I ran over to help. I needed some lumber cut so I left my trolley next to the saw at the back of the store and had to walk all the way up to the front to find someone, they should really have some sort of a ""call/buzz for service"" option, as I'd imagine this would be a frequent request. The guy I found seemed unimpressed and annoyed, as if I inconvenienced him from whatever he was doing... I simply asked if there's someone available to do a lumber cut ""Yup.. that's me *pft*..."" We then proceeded to the back of the store, he seemed aggravated the whole time and did not want to make conversation. When we got there ""Okay, what do you want..."" Sure enough he completed the cuts I needed, but he did not enjoy doing it by any means. He didn't ask if I needed help with anything else. I was happy to head away to the register and leave, but then even at the register, no smile or friendliness was granted either, no ""thank you"" or ""have a great day"", just ""your total is..."". I can see why they changed their slogan from ""You can do it. We can help."" To ""More Saving. More Doing."" Because clearly they don't like to help, they just like to let you do it all on your own... Super unimpressed with the service here... It's too bad, because as a department store they really carry a lot of great stuff and they have some good sales as well. They specialize in home improvement and construction items, but they have a lot of other stuff for just regular home purchases and non-DIY people. I won't get into all the good stuff and actual benefits Home Depot offers for this review, yup there are some... But this visit didn't feature any of them, next time I'll probably go to Lowes or Rona.",negative
"Never pay any contractor work through these guys up front! They're 4 months into my bathroom renovations and the work isn't even half complete. Also, remember DO NOT USE BLUE OCEAN CONTRACTORS. These guys put down cracked granite counters, messed up the grout and are incredibly rude.",negative
"This one's for those of you looking to buy a major appliance...typically the kind of thing you don't want to have to move/adjust/tip/slide or INSTALL yourself. We recently purchased a new w/d from HD on McLeod Trail. To be frank, w/d shopping kinda sucks as there are way too many options. Fortunately, the sales agent in Appliances was very knowledgeable about models and got us to spend our money with confidence in what we were buying. Here's where things go south. Our delivery/install was scheduled for 3 weeks later. The delivery company is a 3rd party that will do NOTHING other than pop the new one in place and take the old one away (if you pay for that service). Meaning, they won't disconnect something that's connected, they don't have parts (that HD failed to tell us we had to buy separately) to connect the new one. Effectively, if it's screwed, they won't unscrew it...and if it's unscrewed, well, you get the idea. HD has charged us for an install. We expect it to be working based on this. They would like us to go back to HD and then reschedule the ""Installation Guys"" to come back to do this. Before we got into this we were told to go to Coast Appliances. Rats.",negative
"The Home Depot on Macleod Trail is my go to spot for home supplies. I recently moved from a condo into a house and have made multiple trips and purchases. Among those purchases include a natural gas BBQ, a bunch of tools for the yard, indoor paint and painting supplies, cleaning supplies, and a number of other small purchases. On occasion I will need to ask someone working in one of the departments for help. There are always a ton of employees around that are knowledgeable and will take the time to give you a good answer. When asked, the employees will often walk you over to where the products you are looking for are located and help you select the right one. The main point of my review is that every visit I've made to the Home Depot has been positive and I always leave with the product I need. What more can you ask for? In addition to everything I said above, this Home Depot was our go to spot for supplies during the flood. We always found what we needed, whether it was gloves, rags, lights, dehumidifiers and pressure washers! It saved us a ton of time being able to come here and know that they would have what we need in stock!",positive
"I come here fairly regularly now to get supplies for work. Most of the time I need plywood ripped into 2-3"" strips. The shop I work in doesn't have the space for me to have a panel saw to rip the sheets myself so I'm relegated to having Home Depot do it for me and generally, not do it correctly. I haven't been able to find anyone in the city yet that can do this for me at a reasonable price so I can avoid this nightmare. The first problem is that they don't like to do more than two cuts on a sheet, but they'll happily charge you for additional cuts. I am happy to pay, but sometimes they'll tell you to come back later if they're too busy dealing with contractors. When did Home Depot turn into a wholesaler? I understand they're getting more money from a contractor buying materials for a job site, but if your store is all about home improvement why are you turning away individual customers? The second problem is that the staff are useless. If I ask for a cut that is 3"" then I want one that is 3"", not 2 7/8"". Learn how to use the saw and do things properly. This isn't rocket science. Luckily I don't need the strips to be exact and have taken some bad cuts just to get out of the store within the same hour I came in.",negative
"I have had work done from this home depot on more than on occassion, and it has always been a positive experience. I have used their installation services on the following: 1. Carpet 2. New Exterior doors and storm doors I have also dealt with Home Depot on getting quotes for laminate flooring installations, as well as a new back deck. I have to save for those ones.... :) I will continue to utilize Home Depot`s installation department, simply because they are happy and eager to do smaller jobs, that are tough for me to find general contractors to do at a reasonable price. If I was doing a full-fledged renovation, then I suppose I would have a lot of options. However, in having smaller jobs done in the $500 - $2000 range, Home Depot continues to win my business!",positive
"I am going to guess that the Bay's days are numbered if what we saw today continues. Everyone knows Bays are messy, the unclassy customers throw everything around, leave a jumble behind and there are no staff around to help the customer or tidy things up. What I saw today was all of those accentuated and worse. Setting aside the sloppy and lazy customers, the Bay has always been and will probably always be an untidy 'department store.' There is just no aesthetic to the place. Simply put there is no competition in Canada. They have no employees to assist you, there are women standing behind the perfume counters (probably financed by perfume manufacturer), but no one on the floor to help... cash stations closed, etc. Let's put all of that aside. We were there today interested in winter coats and jackets and just plain walked out. Guess what they have on the rack? 'Ivanka Trump' and right under it: ""Made In China."" Even if queen tackiness (remember this is the woman whose father wanted to ""date"" her and goes around talking about women's rights, but is a paid advisor to daddy) didn't make her ""America first"" shoddy merchandise in China I would still not touch anything the dictator's enabling daughter made with a ten foot pole.... ... and I would not even stay around to look to potentially shop at a store that carries merchandise by a hillbilly buffoon. Bye Bye Bay... don't trip over the jackets on the floor as you turn off the lights and go join Sears.",negative
"I had poor customer service here. Upon finding no staff, I was able to find a dress shirt myself. I eventually tracked down a staff member at the counter to open a change room for me. This lady on staff then hustled out another customer out of a change room so i could use it (presumably so she didn't have to clean it). Then left, i had to have my fiancee find my other sized shirts to try. The staff member later came back and yelled at me for trying on too many shirts that I SHOULD HAVE asked her to measure me. Never did this person ask to assist me or measure me or help in anyway. But then she has the audacity to suggest it is my fault and complain that she will have to fold the shirts later. I'm very disappointed at the Bay. It seems very understaff and the staff it has have poor attitudes.",negative
"I know people live in Canada don't have a lot choices for department store shopping. Maybe that is the reason a lot of sales working at the Bay store could not care less about customer service. I went to the bay at center point mall to buy Estee lauder skin care as gift for my mother. I didnt mind the women working at the cosmetics counter talked to the elder couple behind me even I was there first. After 15 minutes waiting I was ready to ask for her assistance, she walked pass me to the other counter and started talking to the other customer. I was only person standing in front of her. It's like I am totally invisible. I guess they were trained to pick certain customer they like to serve and ignore others. Because of the awful service, I left and went to shoppers beauty boutique instead. Surprisingly I got almost 150 dollars worth of bonus points for 400 dollars purchase. A small piece of advice, anyone still planning to buy skincare/cosmetics at the Bay, better to check the batch code online before you pay. You might end up buying a lotion which has been sitting in their warehouse for 2 or 3 years.",negative
"This is an awful store and location. I've been in multiple times and every time has been bad service. Once we were waiting at the cash in the men's section for 15 minutes for someone to show up so we could check out. We searched for them everywhere and no where to be found I finally left my boyfriend at the cash to wait while I went downstairs to have them call someone. That was appalling but we got over it. The store was also a complete mess and even though it was 5p on a Friday (there should've been plenty of sales associates on the floor) there was no one. We even saw a man swipe a bunch of sunglasses off one of the displays and no one stopped him! (We would've said something but couldn't find any associates!) Anyways back to now. I went shopping for some dresses for me and shirts for my bf and couldn't find anyone to help so I just grabbed what I could find. Anyways I'm going to stop by rant but tonight I had THE WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE IVE EVER EXPERIENCED! And from 3 different associates! 2 upstairs at the men's cash and 1 bitch downstairs at women's cash. I'm completely appalled and disgusted at this customer service in the store and how they treat people. I tried calling the store after and of course they give you the run around. Not surprising. The best is that as I was coming down from the escalator I watched one of the sales associates behind the watch counter slip a watch into his pocket with no one watching. So it seems even the associates don't believe this store is worth respecting. Dead The Bay, this is disgusting. You should shut down that location and brutally fire everyone they are awful people. I'm appalled and disgusted at how they treated me and how they treat the store.",negative
"This place (The Bay at Yonge and Steeles) needs better service. There are fewer staff and cashiers everyday. It's been my shopping spot for years and being an outlet kind of store, sometimes you find deals but today I was thinking maybe with this long waits at the cash register is not worth it anymore.",negative
"As much as the online shopping is convenient, the items actually being shipped are terrible! I've placed 3 orders the past couple of months & have had to return almost all the items - very inconvenient to drive to the store to return. A neckless was broken (in the packaging!), wrong size shoes and sweater had a run in it. The people packaging these items are not double checking the items, at the store (Yorkdale), I was given the run around from one cashier to another to make the return, very few cashiers and staff in general. This store has gone way down in customer service the past few years.",negative
"Ok I just spent 30minutes shopping and picking things out and a girl started a fitting room for me. When I went to try the items on they couldn't find all the clothes I had picked out. I wasted over 30 minutes of my life because of these idiots. My time is precious I work a lot, I can't afford to waste time like that. I understand they're young but come on people get it together.",negative
I arrived at the store at 8:45pm to just pick up some hair wax and the store was already locked up. I waited out front for a mins or two. And all the employees were not in sight. That's frustrating because I was only going to be on the store for a min and I had plenty of time to get my item. But the employees decided to close early. Don't say that your open till 9 if you close at 8:45...,negative
"Three stars because this store in neat, clean, and the clothes are cute to look at. Probably not my style of clothes anymore, but there are a lot of cute things for my teenage niece. I've always believed that Tilly's is a bit pricey, and it still is. A simple dress from Roxy is $40. Yikes. Weirdly enough, I only saw two employees and greeted by only one. Isn't there usually an army of employees at Tilly's? The one that greeted us was nice and kindly let us know about their promotions. But being only two employees, the one that helped us got caught up with helping another customer and we had to hunt the other one down to check out. Tilly's has cute sandals and backpacks, though! But I'm not a Tilly's girl anymore, I'll leave the store for the youngins.",negative
This store always has a ton of employees on staff yet they seem to only be good at standing around and talking to each other. So beyond incompetent and everyone seems to just be walking around like chickens with their heads cut off.,negative
This knew Tilly's location is way better than the one at Boca Park. Today was my first visit here and I was impressed by the huge selection they carry. The people working here greeted everyone walking through the doors and the store itself seems to be very well stocked and maintained. They have plenty of sizes in stock and their 50% off sale is still going on. I tried a few items on and bought a top and jean shots for $22.00. You can't go wrong with those prices! Looking forward to coming back here again! Thanks Tilly's!!!!,positive
"We LOVEEEE Tom's Place for coming to our rescue and ensuring my now husband, father, and groomsmen arrived confident and in style on our wedding day. After being strung along by another company we learned 6 days before our wedding that the original suits we ordered would not arrive in time for our wedding. We were devastated, frantic, and completely overwhelming rushing store to store trying to find a solution to our dilemma when a good friend recommended Tom's Place. It was a blessing. Unlike all the other places that told us finding fitted suits in a week would be impossible and did not provide us with much assistance, Tom's made it possible! After everything we had been through they assured us they would take care of us and they did more than that. Even though we came to them last minute, they were so patient and spent hours with my husband and groomsmen to find the perfect suits. This sounds cliche, but really when you're at Tom's you don't feel like a customer, you feel like family. We are so grateful and HIGHLY recommend Tom's Place. After that experience, we won't suit anywhere else. Thank you, thank you, thank you!",positive
"I know people have mixed reviews about this place but it's honestly done well by me. I've bought two suits from here, pants, and a couple dress shirts. I felt well taken care of in my three visits to the store.",positive
"I've heard about this place from friends over the years and now needing a new suit, I decided to see what the fuss was about. Well worth it!! Incredible service. Great selection. I thought I'd be in there for at least an hour but I was in, found a perfect suit, the tailor measured me and out in half an hour. Well done. I highly recommend Tom's!",positive
"2.5 Stars. The store is very large with two levels (doesn't really look it from the outside) and the selection is huge! Service was variable, some staff were better than others. All were very eager to get a sale and my fiance did feel a bit of pressure. Nonetheless we spent about $800 on a suit here for our wedding. Where most of the stars were lost was the alterations process. It took over a month for minor alterations, and my fiance is not happy with the work. He had a bad feeling when the tailor came out and roughly made a few chalk marks (took less than 2 minutes to do so). We decided to trust them since they probably go through a lot of suits, but it turns out it wasn't very precise and the suit needs further alterations. Expected better tailoring as we spent $800 on the suit and paid $50 for alterations, and waited over a month. Now have to spend extra money elsewhere to improve the fit since my fiance doesn't trust Tom's Place to fix it. Decently happy with the suit itself, but would definitely opt to go elsewhere for alterations.",negative
"Selection is pretty damn fantastic. However I don't know why Yelp or Torontonians in general think this place is affordable. Men's pants *start* at $165. Suits *start* at $700. Last time I went I couldn't find a decent shirt under $200 I do think for the quality they provide that those are reasonable prices, however I would hardly call it anywhere near affordable. Certainly not Hermes prices, but I think the affordable reputation in Toronto is unearned. That having been said the selection is absolutely outstanding. If you want to find something, you are going to find it here. If money isn't a thing to you, most definitely come here. I vouch for the quality.",positive
"Close to perfect. Went to Harry Rosen, holt and renfrew, saks, Hudson Bay, strellson, brooks brothers. Couldn't believe the prices. What's the difference between a three thousand dollar tux and a thousand dollar one? None that justify the price difference. If you can buy the most inexpensive tux that looks good and feels good, do so. If you can buy an Italian made (Pal Zileri) tux, which also happened to be the most stylish and distinctive tux you've tried over the past two days, even better. If it costs less than nine hundred, super. If the salesman is knowledgeable and helpful, the selection and the service are superb, go to Tom's Place.",positive
"Amazing experience. Walked in and was helped by a most incredible salesman, Joe. Within 10 minutes I had already picked out a suit. I mentioned to him that it's a long trek for me to get down there, so he had the tailor do the alterations within a half hour, so I wouldn't have to come back just to pick it up. Will definitely be coming back for my next suit.",positive
"I purchased a suit from here not too long ago and at this point, I must agree with the majority of the reviews here. They are very pushy. I felt like I was being pressured to buy a suit I didn't like and I felt very uncomfortable throughout the whole process. I will not recommend this place. CUSTOMER SERVICE (1/5) There was this one lady, she was quite tall and a dark blondish hair that was hanging out by the front (I believe her name is Anett). Simply put, she was the rudest person I've ever met in my life. After meeting her, I am certain that I will never go back nor will I ever recommend this place. She just stood there yelling things out and answering out of turn when I didn't even ask her the question to begin with. It was very bothersome. For instance, I asked the sales person that was helping me with my suit how long alterations usually take, and she was about to answer when that tall lady from the front yells at me (cutting both of us off): ""1 week and that's the fastest we will do it!"". That really upset me. As for the sales lady that so-called ""helped me"", she looked terrified and desperate throughout the whole process as if her life depended on this next sale. She had NO KNOWLEDGE of suits. She knew absolutely nothing about suits (or clothes in general), NOTHING! I felt like I was talking to a brick wall, she was in her own little world. I didn't like my suit and kept on voicing this out to her, but she kept on PUSHING AND PUSHING AND PUSHING AND PUSHING, even recruiting fellow sales people to chime in to help further pressure you into just obliging. I honestly have SERIOUS BUYER'S REMORSE, and I have nothing good to say about this place. I am not happy with the suit at all, in fact, I HATE IT. It was just a very uncomfortable experience overall. PRICE (3/5, seems average, but not sure yet, I will get the suit checked by a second tailor) Price wise, I told them my budget, but like I said, they were very pushy, pressuring and overbearing. It was like the whole store was surveilling and judging me the minute I walked in. After having half the store bombard me with statements that I must go up to the next level of price point to even make it worthwhile, I felt a little forced to go to the ""next level"". The sales person kept on reassuring me throughout the whole process: ""oh don't worry, we will make the price work for you"". Well, turns out they didn't ""make it work"" for me. I feel like the prices are artificially raised so that they can ""give you a discount"". So at this point, I'm not sure how good this suit is. I was told it was half canvassed and made in Canada, but I couldn't find the tags anywhere. I will be taking it to a second tailor to get it looked at once I get it back because, to be honest, I feel like I got ripped off at this point (went $300 above budget). NB: I'm getting it tailored (by them; they seemed upset when I asked if I could just take it to my tailor), so I will come back to update the experience as I go. I will be changing the rating as I go along, depending on the experience. But so far, I am confident that I will never be going back to shop there again, and I will let my friends know (who all need suits right now; 2 of which have weddings coming up at the end of the year), not to go here, ever.",negative
"Tom's Place is not a journey, it's a destination. I've been going there for years now and the store has gone through a lot of changes since the early days. There's two parts to Tom's Place, the bargain stuff and the good stuff. Now that's not to say the bargain stuff isn't good. Often times it's very good especially if you don't mind a cheaper suit. The salesmen are hit and miss. Some know their stuff, some are a little less able but they all seem willing to help you find what you need. The good stuff you're going to pay for but here's the secret. It's going to be a LOT cheaper than if you go to Harry Rosen. The same suit can cost you twice or even three times more at Harry's. Then at the end of it all you're cashed out by Tom himself who makes every final sale personal. Typically he'll knock some off the price and if you buy enough he'll throw in a shirt or two for free on top of the discount he gave you on everything else. The only suits I buy are from Tom's Place and I've never had a bad experience there.",positive
very good selection. knowledgeable salespeople. bought Canadian made suit.excellent quality. they know what they're doing. you don't buy a suit every day so be prepared to shell out a bit more for quality. the only thing negative is store layout. not accessible at all.,positive
"Tom's place has a really extensive amount of suits. The prices are probably a little more than they should be but I feel like they are fair, competitive price. I do not feel like they are ripping you off. I have a decent knowledge about suit quality, fit and price so I did not need much help from anyone that worked there. The person that worked with me did not pressure me into buying something I did not want or need. He was nice and knowledgeable. The only thing I felt he could have done better would be asking more questions about what types of suits I wear, where I wear suits, personality and what other suits and clothes I have. I feel like this would help them make suggestions on other suits, shirts, ties, ect. My only real critique and why I am giving a four instead of five star is that after I purchased my suit, they left and walked away from me even though I had some questions about other suits they sell. They should have at least asked me if I had anything else I needed help with and if I didn't, then leave me. This would complete the full experience of buying clothing. Despite this, I would definitely go back for future clothing needs.",positive
"I have to write a review about this place because it was soo good. I came in here from a recommendation from my cousin. After checking out stores like tip top, moores, sarar and harry rosen. I went with Tom's. Harry Rosen - suits are awesome, service is exquisite but price was waay too high for my budget. The suit that I really really liked was $2000, on sale. Next time. Sarar- not bad suits but didn't find the sale price still the best. but not bad material. Their selection is different as well. More for the modern slim, skinny guy. Tip top, moores - meh quality and meh material. Their clothes are starting to become like International Clothiers. Tom's Place: First off, when I go suit shopping, I like to scour the racks and find a whack of them and then try them all on. When I walked in to Tom's, I started to walk by the front staff because I wanted to scour first. I then saw how big it was and knew that I would need help. I was greeted by a nice gentleman who looked like something straight out of the goodfellas. He greeted me, shook my hand, and asked me right away what I was looking for and how much my budget was. I told him looking for 2 suits and a blazer, budget - 800 - 1000. Told him I also saw the sale. He said right away, ""some of those suits you may or may not like as they are clearance. so some will work and some won't. Just letting you know."" He explained it to me in a way that made me feel like giving it a shot but not pressured to go the higher route as well. He then got a sales associate by the name of Walter who was amazing to help me. Walter asked me what types of colors I was looking for and showed me where to find my sizes and I scoured. I wanted something different then the usual black and grey. He then had me try on jackets and pants separate and always was very attentive. After a few yes's and no's and maybes, we narrowed it down. Then I said let's look for a different color. He came back with a few more at my pricepoint and I tried them on. Walter was so attentive and always came back with exactly what I wanted. I asked for a checked grey and solid grey and he came back with 3 nice ones. I took a look at others that might be decent but they didn't work. The guy knew his suits. I was looking at some of the higher priced suits as well that weren't on sale and I really didn't find any colors I liked. When I buy a suit, I look at the color, the material and the fit and the price. After trying on a dozen suits, we went and looked at blazers as well. Not once did I feel pressured at all. He never tried to push me on a high price suit either. I asked him to bring me one and he did but I didn't even like it. I even found a blue pinstripe suit which I was really hunting for, for a really good price. Finally after an hour and a half, I narrowed it down to 3 suits, a blazer and a shirt. When it came to pricing, I was thinking to myself ok let's see how much this will set me back. Tom Sr. came in, did a price adjustment on the suits, even the blue pinstripe as that was 450 and he brought it down to 300. It was definitely a $700 suit. I saw the same suit at the bay for that much. I took my time because I was still leary about the price point and the blazer. They even told me, don't feel pressured that just because we tell you it looks good, you have to get it. It's your decision and your money. For him to say that made my day and my experience. I feel like I could have negotiated a bit more but In the end I feel like I got an amazing deal with a great experience. Keep in mind alterations are extra however they are standard prices. I would hands down go back here again. Expect to spend a few hours though depending on what you want. I would definitely recommend people to go here for their suit needs. You have to spend some time shopping around their for the material and style you want but it's worth it. I'm going back to pick up 1 this weekend and will also take a look at some shirts and pocket squares. This place is definitely a gem.",positive
"I was super impressed by this place. Instead of trying to gouge me on price they were very honest about each suit's quality - including mentioning that unless I have several suits I shouldn't go too high on thread quality (which is inherently more expensive) because it will ware down easily. See my man Dez - old school dude who knows his stuff, is pretty entertaining (perhaps unintentionally) and was super patient while I deliberated over 5 different suits. Tom knocked off the tag price for a sale I didn't even know about and out of goodwill gave me a discount on tailoring because I'm a student. Solid mom and pop shop altogether and no obnoxious upselling or pandering. Tell them your price range when you walk through the door and they'll totally work with you.",positive
"I'm sure glad I read the reviews for Tom's Place after I had already made my purchase - I feel like some of the negative feedback might have scared me off of the place entirely. That being said, I'd received enough personal recommendations from both family and friends that I made the trek into Kensington last week to look for a suit, three days before a wedding. Now I don't pretend to know everything, or really anything, about suits. I know roughly what's in style and what is out of style. Slim cut, IN, box cut, OUT, Thin over wide lapels, and so on. For the purists who've slammed Tom's place, sure, maybe this isn't the best place for you, but, for someone like me who needs a decent suit that will last me a while (to help me look my best the half a dozen times I wear a suit in a year), on a budget, Tom's place is a great find. Are the suits last years style? Sure, but we hold onto suits for way longer once we've purchased one, so what's a year or two if it saves you some serious bucks. For those that feel the story is cramped, well when are you visiting? I went during the week and there was next to no one other than staff on hand, and I felt I had plenty of room to move around. My suit was retail close to $800, Tom's had it marked at $450. Now I don't pretend that I don't know that Tom's likely got this suit for pennies on the dollar, and was why they, without asking, knocked another $100 off the price. Do I care? Not really, the suit is great, fit perfectly the moment I put it on and, well... $350?!! I got the suit on the main floor and my store associate, a woman whose name I don't recall, was very helpful and scoured the racks with me to find a few good options. We then went upstairs where one of the gentlemen there showed me some different shirt/tie/pocket square combos to put together to change the look of my black suit. Every item I ended up purchasing came with an automatic discount, I didn't really need to ask, so I assume it's just standard operating procedure for them to knock some bucks off. Made me wonder if I could have asked for more. At the end of the day I walked out of there with a full outfit for under $700 (including alterations). A real plus for me was despite their 7-10 day alteration turnaround time that they normally request, they went the extra mile for me and had it done in 48 hours (pants taken up and lapels needed to be repressed and flattened out). When I came to try them on, it was Margaret at the front who walked over, pulled up my jacked and said ""something on these pants doesn't look right, take them off and I'll have the tailor redo them"". This for me was a big plus and a sign of good old fashioned customer service - thank you! My ONLY critique was the woman who answered the phone when I phone in (as instructed) to check on the status of my alterations. She was extremely short and snippy on the phone and cut me off mid-question telling me they'd call me back when they knew more. It wasn't a big deal, but a more sensitive customer might take offense to the particular tone and approach she took. As I mentioned, save for the one minor blemish, my experience was hassle and pressure free and I got a good suit at a great price. Best of all, my lady told me I looked great when I suited up, and isn't that the most important point. Thanks Tom's Place, I'll be back for a grey and blue suit when the time comes :)",positive
"They will rip you off! I bought a jacket in which the guy told me it was $450.00 - thinking I'm a good barterer I got them down to $300.00. Afterwards I took it to a guy who used to be in a similar business where he told me they ripped me off - there were no prices on the jacket, no labels as to what the jacket is made of etc. except that it was made for Tom's Place. They will supposedly call Tom to see if he will go down to a better price but I doubt anyone was on the other end. You can do much better at so many other places in Toronto but if you do go please do so with your eyes wide open and do not buy anything that does't already have a price on it. I will never go back. So disapointed in myself for falling for this scam.",negative
Went there to buy a suit...Sasha the sales person was very patient and helpful..Bout 2 suits instead of 1. Would definetely go in again only because of Sasha.,positive
"These guys really helped me. They're staff was equipped with knowledge; they were willing to share and advise it as well. I had no knowledge of suits and I left completely satisfied with one, the product, and two, their service. I'd recommend it for anyone looking at their first suit. I'd also recommend it for anyone looking in the $1000+ price range. They have suits ranging from $150-$1500+.",positive
"It is important to know exactly what you want before going to Tom's Place. The typical person will be overwhelmed by the selection. A common trend with the salespeople here is that they will get you to try out all sorts of different stuff that you originally did not have in mind. That is perfectly okay, given that you try it on FOR SIZE, but KEEP REITERATING to the Sales Associate (SA) what you had in mind originally! Demonstrate that you know exactly what to purchase. If you do this, they will yield and be very helpful. I was chatting with a gentleman about the construction of suits and their respective prices - he was 100% accurate and there was no BS. EDIT: Now that I think about it, he was buttering up his story a bit. Be careful when they ""flaunt"" how great some of the brands are, because the ONLY one for me that's worth purchasing at the store is ""Corneliani"", but they are upwards of $1300. He also gave insightful pieces of advice and life stories that I enjoyed. Contrary to other reviews, my SA didn't exactly pressure me. When I was contemplating to purchase a certain suit (it was beautiful to be honest), another salesman came over and had a chat. Ended the conversation saying I should buy because it is a great deal. Normally, I'd label it as a pressure tactic, but in all honesty, even without his persuasion, I would have purchased because the deal was just too insanely good to pass on. Not going to share the specifics, but the suit I scored costs MUCH more at Harry Rosen. Tom is the man! Beware: if they find out you have a good taste in fashion (aka expensive), they'll show you all sorts of (SEEMINGLY) good stuff to entice you - bring a (guy that REALLY knows their stuff about suits) friend with you to the store if you're a ""noob"". Self-control is paramount. Do your research first!",positive
"THE WORST RETAIL EXPERIENCE OF MY LIFE. 1/5 of stars? They deserve -5/5! Highlights of my experience: -High pressure salespeople - 5 people will swarm you to try to convince you on something; whether it be that something looks ""beautiful"" on you or their alterations were done properly. -Very poor fashion sense. These people are not connected with modern day styles and are fit to serve 60 year olds and above. I guess it's my fault to giving them a chance (I am 29 years old) -They made me buy three suits with pants that did not fit, promising they would special order me new pants. Once I came back to order the pants, they could only do it with 1 out of the 3 pairs. -Alterations were poorly done. They refuse to consider what I wanted and made fun of my style. This coming from a lady who wore such wide legged pants, you couldn't even see her shoes. It's 2014!!! wow...I ended up taking everything elsewhere to do it properly. They deliberately left one pair of pants untouched because I was being ""picky"" -Tom is a typical lying salesman. I don't understand how he's weaseled his way into so many years of service. Don't trust a word he says. Also, buddy, there are more adjectives that is a ""beautiful"" suit on you. -I told him about a guy who helped me at the halton hills location. He was really good and his style suited mine. The staff all made fun of HIS sense of style and said he didnt know what he was doing. They were putting down their own employee when I said he was part of a positive experience of mine. -Tom shook my hand and told me not to come back to the store. Hah, I wouldn't even come back if I was offered 10 free suits. I hope to spread the word so they get the message. YOU NEED CUSTOMER SERVICE TRAINING FOR HEAVENS SAKE!!!",negative
"The sales staff are all trained in 30 year old psychology tricks to make you think you're getting a good deal and make you feel more invested in the process than you actually are. I wouldn't call them pushy (and they seem to vary widely) but some of them are downright rude. For a place that boasts 10'000 suits they present preciously few actual options on top of which, everything takes forever to fetch. They do have a large selection and they do seem to have a lot at lower price points so maybe if you're on a tight budget you'd fare better here than elsewhere. But if you're looking to get a good suit you can almost certainly do better with a department store and a good tailor or one of the cheaper made-to-order places.",negative
"I think my story is similar to a few here: naive clothing buyer, new to Toronto, on a budget but needing work clothes. I don't recall the experience being all that bad. The sales guy I worked with was nice enough--not really pushy. In fact, he was pretty honest about the fact that they just did not have my size. The store does feel a little cluttered--this is certainly not Rosen's! I forget what I ended up with but it was only a few garments. The pants needed to be altered and some mistake was made with the one pair I still have. They were nice Strellson's--the pair of slacks I now wear when I can't wear jeans to something but the weather is crap. I am unsure how good the deals are. You won't overpay here but I don't know if you are getting any kind of serious bargain. It seems like they work on buying a lot of last season's items and passing on the discount to you. I would not go to this store for a suit. Well, I would maybe come here before Moore's or Tip Top. But would I ever return for anything? Maybe. If I was in the area, and there was a particular thing I was looking for, such as a black sweater, I might pop in. Otherwise, it is kind of an experience, much like Honest Ed's, that everyone in Toronto should try once. A comment on those ""5 suites for $x"" and similar deals. Men, please don't go for this. Don't repeat my costly mistakes. Look, anything that is being advertised based on price is just not going to be high quality. Items of very high quality are rarely ever on any kind of serious sale. And a suit NEEDS to be high quality. The first reason for ever buying certain items should NEVER be ""because I got a good price."" A suit is high up there on the list. Chances are that a hiring manager, people you want to date and your clients are going to be able to spot a cheap suit. You don't want to be that guy in the cheap suit. Besides, does anyone other than politicians and Bay Street boys really need 5 suits? Do yourself a big favour. Save up some money ($1,500 is a good start) and get a properly made bespoke or MTM suit. Navy blue or charcoal grey. Goes with everything. Next suit can be the other colour if you find you need more than one. Very few of us really do. Take time, build your wardrobe carefully and thoughtfully. A well made suit will last a long time--clothes shouldn't be bought and worn as disposable items.",negative
"I've been going to Tom's place for almost 6 years now, and never had a bad experience. Went there today and it was just as I expected. Was immediately greeted by Patrick Duncan (he has helped me in the past), told him what I wanted, and within 10 minutes I was paying. Tom was very helpful on the price, and threw in a suit bag and a pair of funky socks. Turns out it was Duncan's Wife's birthday, and he was still at work. I hope he takes her out for a nice dinner. If you are looking for a good suit, at a good price I can't recommend a better place.",positive
"Hey I read some of the other posts below but I had to check this out for myself. I'm originally from NY's Lower east side and had never been to Kensington Market till last weekend. I had told my brother n law that I wanted a new sports jacket and couldn't find anything that I liked in Moores. He told me to checkout Toms. I walked in and immediately felt like I was back at home on Orchard St. A huge selection in a somewhat cramped space. The staff were super friendly. The S.P. introduced himself and asked my name. Being in sales for years myself this impressed me. I immediately found more then 4 items that I liked, and ended up buying 2 and feel I got a good deal. I thoroughly enjoyed my experience there and highly recommend that you check it out for yourself. Hey ask for Lawrence he was a top notch nice guy to deal with.",positive

"Honestly, I don't know much about suits. The salespeople seemed to want to hurry me away so they can meet their next customer. They would say certain things and watch me inspect my own purchase that made me feel hurried and thus uncomfortable. The tailor is terrible! Not recommended to anyone! Get your alterations done elsewhere! Here is what was wrong with my suit (everything below was found after the alterations were done): 1. Chalk marks still visible on the outside of the suit jacket 2. Suit jacket not ironed out so it was wrinkly 3. The jacket's back right bottom flap and back left bottom flap around my ass area were not level which made one side 4mm higher than the other side when viewed from the back 4. Suit jacket was not flat against my body where the centre chest piece meets the arm piece at the shoulder which made the shoulder areas stick out in the front and back 5. When you flip your pants upside down and inspect the crotch area, the four lines should come together to look like two lines (like a cross or ""X""). Mine was three lines because two of the lines did not align properly 6. Right pant leg was 5mm longer than the left pant leg. Turns out the bottom of my left pant leg was folded straight, but the right pant leg was folded curved and improperly (one end of the fold was level with the other leg, but not the other end) 7. When the pants are worn, the pants should be fairly straight with a slight bend. Somehow, the salesperson (unintentionally or intentionally) missed the bunching up of excess fabric near my shoe (like when you wear pants way too long and the fabric falls down onto your shoe). But I think this may also have been because the pants were too tight or is the style 8. Vests are supposed to fit tight against the body (from my online research) but mine still had a lot of fabric in the breast and shoulder blade area that could have been taken out I know I nitpicked every single tiny detail and was looking for perfection, but here's why: I shelled out $600 for a fine Italian suit. But, really, some of my findings just tell me the tailor doesn't really know what he's doing and didn't do a thorough and complete job. P.S. If you drive here, park in the multi-level parking garage on Baldwin and present your parking ticket to the person at the front counter for a rebate. P.S.S. As a seriously dissatisfied customer, if any of you are truly skeptical of my review, drop me a message and I'll take photos of my Strellson suit for you.",negative
"Horrible customer service!!! I actually had a staff member snatch a shirt out of my hands I was going to try on, after I had already bought a bunch of things. I can understand wanting to have staff around to try things on, but instead of acting professional and explaining that, this guy got in my face and rudely pointed out this wasn't Walmart (I was with someone else as well) and yanked the shirt right out of my hands. It was the single worst customer service I have every experienced.",negative
"While the IDEA of Tom's Place is very appealing the execution leaves much to be desired. Let's break it down into functional chunks: Location: Great! Right in the heart of Kensington Market - convenient to TTC and lots of parking nearby. Ambiance: One has to imagine that the canned sardines of allegorical fame have more room to move around than either the suits or customers in this ""before"" poster for Fire Marshall training. It is C-R-O-W-D-E-D in here! Add some bad lighting and you get an interior shot of Tom's Place when you look up ""ramshackle"" in the on-line dictionary, Staff: Sigh. Pret-ty, pret-ty bad. Pretty much caricatures of pushy salesmen. The Suits: A mixed bag. Mostly ""Moores"" level of quality, a fair bit of mid-level dept. store stuff (Canadian Made!), a sprinkling of higher end material (from last season) and, of course, some pure crap. The ""Deal"": The X for 1 deal is a nice marketing ploy, but bears little semblance to actual street prices. Their goal is to sell at least 5 suits per customer and the suits are arranged so that you are pretty much compelled to select a couple of better, a couple of mid, and one or two pieces of junk. The ""deal"" prices tend to magically average out to $300 to $350 per suit. Always. You will invariably include one ""Why the hell did I buy that?"" suit in your deal, so use that to figure your average price. The Verdict: Meh. You can do better in Montreal and still get current season product or just drive down to Buffalo and save another 20-30%. If you have an empty suit closet (just starting out. weight gain/loss) you may pick up a reasonable package, but don't expect to be overwhelmed by the price quality access.",negative
"I was recently part of a wedding party whose groom decided that we would be buying our suits from Tom's. I have always been told that it woul d be a good place for me to check out good designer suits and so on and so forth, so I was pretty excited. As the end goal was matching suits, we were reasonably expected to reserve our jacket size; fair enough. When the day came to go get measured for alterations, a friend of mine was told that they did not have his size and he would have to wear TWO sizes smaller or he ""could always just lose some weight"". He's a big guy and kind of oddly proportioned, so while still pretty dickish, I could kind of understand that he'd be a difficult fit. Me, on the other hand, was forced to wear two-sizes UP from a 38, and their solution was to make us pay for a ton of alterations, which still ended up looking far too big. Suit + Alterations probably cost around $450-500 (I'm not sure how much the alterations cost, but considering they pretty much disassembled and reassembled the suit, I'm sure it was over $100). For that price, I could have gotten a made-to-measure suit from one of the many online tailors (Brooklyn Tailors, Modasuite, etc) and have it fit like a glove. Hell, I've bought suits from H&M and Mexx that fit better than this suit after alterations, for less than half the cost! This place thrives on people who want to feel they've gotten a bargain for a brand name, instead of spending money on a proper-fitting suit that was made properly for their bodies.",negative
"One of my best friends is getting married, and instead of having us all in tuxedos, he optioned for slightly more stylish suits. Finding matching suits for three groomsmen and a best man who are all different sizes is tricky, so we went to Tom's because we knew we could get a deal on the suits, and they'd probably have a few that matched. We were lucky, we got four of the same, and at a decent deal; About $180 a suit before alterations. These aren't incredible suits, but they look decent enough and the price was unbeatable. We all needed alterations. We got marked up and left the suits with them for a month and a half. Last week we picked up the suits, and in our hurry to get to the bachelor party that night didn't check the alterations very closely. It wasn't until tonight that two of us tried our suits on again and realized that literally nothing had been done to them in the way of alterations. My pants are still covered in chalk marks, the shoulders are still an inch too broad on either side, and the waist could fit two of me. Were we stupid to wait so long? Absolutely. Should we have stuck up to the salesman who swindled us into buying suits that were too big? Definitely. But he told us he could fix it all with alterations, and we're young and gullible. Bottom line, don't waste your time here. The quality of the suits are mostly rubbish, the salesmen are pushy, and don't care what fits as long as they make the sale, and the alterations didn't happen. At all. After a month and a half. We'll be taking the suits back tomorrow and asking for our money back on the alterations. We'll have to take them to a tailor in the city to fix their bullshit.",negative
"Tom's Place in Kensington Market is an institution: I suspect that every young Bay Streeter has paid Mr. Mihalek a visit, or attended one of his 'warehouse' sales at the Miles Nadal JCC or elsewhere on Bathurst. The place is a maze, with sales help hiding around corners and ready to help you navigate the racks. While the layout invites browsing the sales pitch can be aggressive and also focuses on the house brand rather than designer 'finds'. A fair chunk of the latter may be seconds or dead stock, but since it all just piles up like an episode of ""Hoarders"", Tom's could actually double as one of the better Vintage shops in the market. Much has been written about Tom's willingness to haggle, and it's true, but watch the sticker pricing on suits, shirts and ties. For widely available brands and can easily buy off the rack, you might do better at a department store sale. Still, Tom's is good theater, and a vital part of a neighborhood built on thrift. More importantly, customers leave happy, convinced they've scored a serious bargain.",negative
"I find this European chain to be equivalent to a Zara maybe? The clothing is a much better quality than, say, Forever 21 and fairly trendy. I was first introduced to the brand in London and always make a point to visit if it's located in a city I am visiting. This location is large as it houses both womens and a mens side (TopMan)! They have clothing, a nice sized shoe dept as well as accessories and makeup. Their prices are fairly affordable especially if you shop the sales and clearance. I scored a cute wallet, classic purse (yay for no obnoxious logo) and some makeup for less than $50 - all on sale . Beware of some items being final sale so make sure you're committed to your purchases. There are no heavily pushy sales associates here. I saw some random folks on the sales floor but they were doing merchandising. Overall, very pleasant shopping experience. I would go back if in the area.",positive
"Quality clothing-- thicker material so one wash doesn't make it look overused, especially basics like shirts and sweaters. Expect prices to reflect said quality. Originating from the U.K., this shop has the most recent trends in fashion and keeps customers up to date in style. They even have personal shoppers ready to assist in daily wear or special occasions. Make an appointment. I've only visited the Water Tower location in Chicago and expected to spend a hefty amount on jewelry (accessories make the outfit, yenno) but was pleasantly surprised to see so many markdowns on pieces I liked! $2 necklaces? Score! I saved over 90% plus there's an additional 10% off discount with student ID, in store and online. Their makeup is affordable and made in the U.K. Lipsticks start at $12. Check the lines at the registers-- nail polish on sale drops to $2-4. Fitting rooms are located on the right side near the shoes. Top Man is next door on the right. This was the only store we went to at Fashion Show mall due to limited time but it was worth it! I parked on the ground floor garage directly below, area 16 red and was ecstatic the escalator brought us right to Top Shop's entrance!",positive
"Fantastic store full of latest trends for women and mens wear. Fashionable clothing from shoes to shirts. Especially suits they have are slim fit and nice fitting sizes. I really like the accessories offered like wristbands and necklaces. I usually look for pants, shirt, and chunks boots. Fitting rooms are spacious and adequate lighting. Great to talk to cashiers. Clean well organized store. I recommend topshop or top man to those young people who like to take Instagram pictures in their fashion. I sometimes go online on ASOS or next door to zara. But I like the snug fit of topman.",positive
"This store has a really really wide selection in all types of sizes and styles. Everything was neatly organized and their clearance section was top notch as well. I bought a tank, a pair of flats, and a necklace. My cashier was really kind and thorough with return policies. Wish I lived closer but will definitely be returning here when I come back.",positive
Nice clothes but people who work here are rude! Person at fitting room was on her phone. Guy at the register didn't even smile or greet me I had to go to him and he never said thank you just have my bag. Great clothes + horrible service= I'm never going back,negative
"I was so excited to visit a stand alone Topshop store! Where I am in Florida, there is only a section in my Nordstrom and the styles are very limited. I love the styles and fit of Topshop. There are different styles on the West coast so it's really nice to see the regional fashion. I went to town at this store. The sales are clearly marked and neatly racked. The sizes are properly placed around the store. The shoe sections are scattered but I later found a back room full of shoes. The quality of their shoes are hit or miss. Some of them look very cheap and the pair I wanted had dried glue stick all over it. The sales rep there was very nice and helpful. Patient with my requests. The girl working the fitting room didn't check on me but when I asked for another size, she got it quickly.",positive
"I went to returned my boot and my cashier was pretty nice I only bought it for 2days then I had to ruptured it because I couldn't fit it into my travel bag. Then another lady walked in and checking on that boot I asked her if everything is ok ? She said yes but the way she looked at me was no ! I know there is something wrong, I told her when I bought this the shoes box already has some scratch like that. I'm not type of person to buy and used it and return ok? Don't give me a look like that ! That was rude.. I mean if I could fit it in my bag I would NOT returned it !",negative
Was there yesterday and in a hurry to find a dress for a meeting. Kris greeted me at the door and was a huge help! She pulled several different choices for me. 10 mins later had the perfect dress and was out the door. Thank you!!,positive
"While I WAS enjoying my time here initially, that changed towards the end. So, I went and got two things off of the sale rack (2 dresses). I went to the cashier to pay for them and the salesperson (Joseph) told me it was buy one get one free. He said it was ALL of the sale items with a pink tag on it. So I was excited and happy and told him after our transaction I would go back and look for more. So, I find two more items ( a dress and a clutch) both with the same pink tag, this time someone else is at the register and tells me ""no, the buy one get one free is only for accessories and jewelry."" I explain that I JUST had the same transaction and was told and rung up differently. This salesperson insisted I was wrong and got the manager. The manager came and asked to see me receipt and still said ""no this is wrong, I don't know why he rang that up like that and told you that."" I'm not sure why everyone isn't on the same page at this store. BUT the fact that I was told something from a salesperson there, they need to acknowledge that and honor the discount. But they didn't, she told me I was wrong and that was that. Unbelievable!",negative
"This is my favorite Topshop that I have been to so far. I've been to Topshop at Nordstrom and the big one in Chicago and none of them compare to this one. I'm not sure if it's because they are located in Las Vegas aka they have better style clothes shipped here for this store, but it's a better selection here than other places. This location is always so clean and the customer service is great. They also have a private shopping dressing room which consists of a couple of spacious dressing rooms and a private check out area. I also love that they have a huge selection of petite size clothes! I couldn't give this place 5 stars though, only because I think majority of the items here are overpriced!",positive
"Went into Topshop today to return an outfit and I was told by Sara ""the manager"" that my clothes were too worn. She arrived to the counter in a horrible mood and didn't even greet me with a hello or how are you or even introduce herself as the manager. I worn them for maybe an hour and they were still in perfect condition. She then told me the extra buttons are missing but I don't know anyone that keeps the extra buttons on their outfits while they wear them. Just the week before I spent $500 on clothes there and I just needed to return one outfit but she said that she sees clothes everyday and mine are ""wrinkly"" so u can't return them for me because they have a few wrinkles she said yes and that's it. She was so disrespectful and very demeaning. I said then maybe I'll try to go to a different Topshop facility so I can talk to someone with better customer service skills and she said good luck because I'm the manager and were the only Topshop in Vegas. This is apparently the only Topshop in Vegas so needless to say I won't be shopping there anymore. Sincerely, a used to be a loyal guest!",negative
"Nice selection, good prices, horrible service. I found an item, ready to buy, but nobody helped me for 20 mins. Finally, I had to hunt one of them down, and he guided me to the fitting room and then ran away. I stood there... wanted a different size, but nobody would help me. So I walked out.",negative
"This is one of my favorite places to shop. Their jeans are truly amazing (for my body type) they carry some unique stuff. I don't see why someone would call this an over priced Urban Outfitters, The prices are not much different and the clothes at Top Shop are much more trendy. What I'm really impressed with at this particular store is the amazing customer service. Thank you to the staff for being so helpful when needed and not hovering over you every second when not needed.",positive
"At stores like Topshop, you're partially paying higher prices for the unique clothing, and partially paying for a fabulous employee to put together a great outfit for you. I rushed in ten minutes before closing, needing an outfit because all my luggage had been lost. The employees (despite being almost done for the day) pulled my sizes in dresses and shoes, grabbed accessories and purses, and soon made an outfit much cuter than anything I had lost in my luggage. A huge thank you to Topshop- while the clothing is fabulous, great employees are what make shopping fun. I'll be back next time I'm in Vegas... and the time after that.. and the time after that!",positive
"To me, this was a higher-priced H & M store. I looked at the clearance racks, grouped according to size (smaller sizing, BTW), in the front, and I started to lose interest because the sale prices I thought were a little on the high side (trying to stick to my new rule of only buying items that I truly love, which means it will get used more often). In this mall, I'd rather shop at the following: Ann Taylor Loft, The Limited, Forever 21 or Cotton On. I don't understand the buzz.",negative
So I gave it another try last weekend. I am please to say they are becoming more and more like the one I see in London! I'm excited! the shoe selection was to die for! I love it now and will probably go back there next time. I wish they had more purses though!,positive
eh its OK. That was my thought going through the store the entire time. It just reminds me of a pricey H&M/Forever 21. Now being my favorite store is Free People I'm used to spending 100-150$ for a shirt but i couldn't really find anything here that was worth that. I'm very particular about the pieces I chose for my wardrobe that being said I don't think Ill be returning here anytime soon. I mean $75 for leggings? a little ridiculous if you ask me.,negative
"This store is a bit pricey . Your $$ goes further at H&M and Forever 21. For the price, Zara fits the value better. Also, I didn't realize many of their garments can't go to dryer.....until it's too late.",negative
"This new store is located in Fashion Show Mall on the Las Vegas strip. I stopped by to browse and I found a cute necklace that I purchased for $3! So, 5 stars for the $3 find and the friendly service at the cash register. Everything else grossly overpriced for the quality not sure what the hype is about this place. If you want to spend money on cool clothes go to Zara's!",negative
"Overrated..... why come here when you can get the exact same thing at H&M or Forever 21 for literally 1/2 the cost. The people behind the counter are rude, too. I don't wanna give my money to a place that sells hipster clothes that only homeless people would wear.",negative
Took my wife here since she wanted to check out what all the hype was all about... I was surprised at how many options they had available. They even serve chilled drinks while your significant other shops. I personally didn't find anything but then again I wasn't really looking at the clothes at least hahaha.,positive
"Finally I made it TopMan after browsing their website for awhile since I didn't really have the time to head to New York or London. Well my expectations were filled but I wasn't overly impressed. Prices are pretty average for the merchandise as this is not H&M nor is it considered high-end. From full suits to basic tees and undergarments the selection for men was decent. Customer service was average as I browsed and offered help here and there. The guys in the men's shoes and fitting rooms were exceptionally helpful. I had to try on like 15 shirts and tees and like 4 jeans so the fitting room associate was extremely patient and help to organize my looks. Next, I happen to hit TopMan when the summer stuff was on sale so much of the merchandise was extremely discounted. For example, so much of the necklaces were only $2 or $4 down from $25-$40! There's no TopMan in Colorado or much of America so I think your purchases will be pretty unique. Overall it was a great time and I cam away with my student discount of 10% (bring your student ID) on top of the end-of-summer sale.",positive
"When you walk in, the music makes it feel like you've entered a club. The wife spent about an hour looking at the clothes, but as for the men's selection, too tight, and too small. Maybe it's just not my style.",negative
"They have a photo booth! :)) What a great souvenir. Besides that, this is definitely a start. Nothing can compare to the location in London, but its a good start. They have a nice store front display, and its in a decent location. The shoe section is okay, but they do have a good selection with the space they have. Maybe its because I'm no expert when it comes to money exchange, but why are the prices for clothing more than double here in America? We looked up the exchange rate and it wasn't making sense.... Until they can figure out a better way of pricing their items, I'm still going to be loyal to Forever. I LOVE TOPSHOP, but I need to understand how they are trying to price things. I did ask someone working there to explain it to me, but she had no idea. All in all, yes, stop by this store, take some photos in their booth, and have a look around. The woman helping us was friendly...she was in the shoe department, no one else asked us if we needed help so I can't vouch for them. This was a really fun place to look around.",negative
"I've been shopping at the Topshop online store for years, this was my first time going to the store. We Came here on Sunday before going back to LA. Its located in the Fashion Show mall. The store is massive. It has such a lovely selection and fun atmosphere. lm 5'0 tall and under 85lbs and they had a petite section! Probably my favorite part.. They also had a huge selection of accessories. Loved the socks and necklaces. The shoe section is also a good size. Some of the shoes were on sale for the holiday weekend. I was treated so well by the employees. They were all extremely helpful and friendly. I had a personal shopping suite and my own stylist Ginger who was such a doll. I think she is also the manager. She walked up to me numerous times while I shopped and took my items. I ended up spending about 2 hours at Topshop and walked away with tons of great finds. I now know every time I go to Vegas I'll set a few hours aside to shop here. Next time I go I'll call/email Ginger to pull clothes in my size. My overall experience here was amazing.",positive
"I died and went to retail heaven. I am obsessed with the website and I was so happy to finally walk through an actual store! Whether you've heard of it or not, if you love fashion you will love TOPSHOP.... Guaranteed. And that's all you really need to know.",positive
"Great store with tons of great pieces and basics. This is the Uniqlo/GAP/H&M of London. Much of the stuff is expensive for what it is, but you can find a good deal. They have some great shoes and dresses for reasonable prices. The jewelry section is amazing and I was so tempted to buy a bunch of stuff. I also like that they have a 10% discount for students, woo. I bought a cute polka dot dress (somewhat retro), some cute flats, and socks. Some of the loafers they have are cute and all leather but pricey for what I was looking for... $65 for cheap loafers... decided to spend that on my dress! And the dress is machine washable! Sizing is a little odd... I'm usually a 0 or 2, and a 4 in my dress fit me ok. The 2 was too tight. Odd. Definitely need to try before you buy here. The dressing rooms are spacious and nice. They're a bit understaffed though. All the clothes are on trend and will be standout pieces in your wardrobe... this is more than I can say for Uniqlo/GAP who specialize in the basics. Definitely worth a stop to shop. After I purchased my goods and walked around to other stores and other malls, people actually stopped me to ask me about Topshop. I guess it's pretty popular since it's so new in Vegas.",positive
"Admission: I love bargains! For most items, I feel that unless the clothes are being made in Italy, you are ending up with the same quality, so why pay an arm and leg to cover your arm and legs? If I am going to spend a pretty penny, I want to go big or understand the value. The shopping experience and selection at Topshop is fun and stylish if you enjoy UK chic, but I found myself circling like a vulture and simply spying on price tags. Everything was about 2 to 3 times more than I anticipated, so I decided to leave without a shiny new item this time. For example, some Tom-inspired shoes displayed on plastic hangers (not in boxes) were around $50. Here is a case where I'd rather get the Toms for a little more and do a little good in the process. I will probably head back to see if there are sales that make some of their items look more ""must have"" when discounted.",negative
"So I finally got to visit Topshop/Topman and i must say i'm loving the pieces they have. Very up to date and fashionable. For all you fashionistas out there this is a great place to shop. I liked a lot of their clothes but i'm more on the heavy set so i really don't know if their stuff would fit me, looks kind of snug. One thing that caught my eye was all the cool accessories they had. Some employees were helpful&friendly others just stood there, I must say, there are a lot of cute girls that work there lol. So to sum it all up it's a very fashionable store in the Fashion Show Mall on The Strip with tons of space and a lot of dope pieces to choose from, kind of pricey but dope none the less.",positive
"So I just survived the grand opening of topshop here in Las Vegas yesterday and overall it was a great experience. The preopening ceremonies were kinda cool. I got to see Steve Wynn and Kristen Bell. They also had a fashion show and some free goodies. They gave away tote bags and gift cards. I got a wristband to be one of the first ones inside. Inside they had a photo booth, hair and makeup makeovers, and gift with purchases. Most the workers were very nice and attentive. They had a little trouble checking me out at the till but that was okay since I was probably her first customer. Although they are a little pricey I love their stuff. I had to take away one star because of the very rude worker that was handing out gift bags to the crowd. He purposely passed by me multiple times saying that he had to ""spread them out"". He handed them to all the non Asians around us. Who already had multiple bags. He would be handing the bag in my direction, look at me, and then pause and pass it back. Like one or two times that's okay maybe he did need to ""spread them out"" but three or four times, really now. Overall I really do love their store. They also brought in people from the UK to help manage I guess. Their accents and being in Topshop really made me reminisce about my summer in Cambridge.",positive
This bike store was recommended to me by a friend and we got great bikes for both the kids. Angie was super to work with and went over and beyond. Awesome choice & great customer service.,positive
This store was recommended since I needed a bike that would not only fit my needs but also fit me. I need a bike for exercise due to some knee and back issues. Met with Kenny and he was knowledgeable about which bike would be best for me. I added additional items to the purchase. This is a much better experience than the previous bike store I had visited. My bike will be built and ready in about a week. I'll add to this review once I've received the bike. But so far so good.....update...went back to the store to pick up my bike a week later and couldn't ask for better customer service. 100 % satisfied with the trek store.,positive
"I would like to commend Trek of South Charlotte for the great customerservice.Those guys are friendly, they know what they're doing and they really Rock it! Thanks so much for all the help!",positive
"I've been riding bikes for 20 years. This is the BEST EXPERIENCE I'VE EVER HAD. Yes, they fixed the mechanical issue I identified at good price. But they found some issues I had no idea about. The found them, called the manufacturers of the substandard parts and got them replaced. In the end they treated my bike like it was their own. I got literally 10X back in value that I paid for the original issue. This is my, hands down, one stop, go to, trusted bike source FOREVER.",positive
Matt Rossman was very helpful and professional. He helped my buddy get his bike back into shape so he could have transportation to work. My buddy was in a financial bind and he put together some budget friendly options to take care of the most pressing needs. Will totally come back because of Matt's service and expertise.,positive
If you need a bicycle mechanic ask for Francisco. Francisco used to be a try sports in South Park and i'm glad to announce he is now at the trek store near Ballantyne. It makes it a lot easier to get in my bicycle equipment so we can fix it with his top notch skills. Francisco has skills mad bicycle skills.,positive
"Went to shop for a new bike after about 12 or 13 years on my old one. I had done a lot of online research and even visited bike shops while out of town of many different makes and models. The team at this store showed me some options and offered a competitive price on a 2015 model Stache 8. They adjusted the fork settings and air, installed my pedals, set the tire pressure and gave the bike a once over before I put in on my bike rack and went directly over to the whitewater center to ride. It felt as good as I had hoped it would. Thanks everybody, you all were helpful and your guidance has provided me with a bike that I really enjoy!",positive
"I bought a cheap bike from a chain store being my first bike and all. I really like the bike but the bike tire kept busting for no apparent reason. The chain store just kept replacing it with the same tube and the problem kept occurring. Took it here frustrated, just wanting to ride without a tire blowing, and they replaced it with the correct tube and explained why it kept happening. Has been good so far for several rides. Was in and out in 10 minutes and was quite cheaper than I expected. Very helpful!",positive
"Can't say enough good things about this place! After buying a bike from a surplus warehouse and spending far more than the 45 minutes estimated to connect the brakes I brought my bike here. Off the bat they charged less than half of the advertised $40 on their website when I dropped it off. When I picked it up they had set up the brakes, inflated the tires and straightened the front tire (that may have been bent while I was wrestling with the brake system earlier) all free of charge. Really nice guys! I will definitely be bringing my bike here for all future anticipated problems!",positive
"I do not have a lot of disposable income and bicycling can quickly become a very expensive endeavor. That said, I stopped by the this location because it's the only bike shop on my commute to work. I ride an old Schwinn Traveler from the 80's so I wasn't hopeful that they would be able to help me let alone be willing. However, they were amazing. A-MA-ZING! They took the time to explain everything to me didn't overcharge for what turned out to be a simple fix. They charge $7.50 to put a new tire on and although this is something I could do myself, I'm going to have them do it for me because they earned my business. Great place. Management if you're reading this, I don't know his name, but the tech behind the counter on the morning of 7/22/14 needs a raise. He's awesome!",positive
"All of the staff we spoke to today we're helpful and are very knowledgable. Ang was awesome! No-pressure to buy. Lots of conversation about the type of riding we were planning to do and physical issues we were being mindful of (lumbar/lower vertebrae issues). Prices are on-par for the types of bikes they carry. There are plenty of accessories (helmets, bells, shorts, water bottles, etc.). The parking lot is a great area to test out the bikes and see what works best for you or your little ones (yes, they have kids bikes). (Update: 1 week later) My husband has been loving his bike! My bike, however, was supposed to be in from the California warehouse on Thurs. Ang was great and called to tell me that not only was my bike not in, but they had no info on when it would be in. She offered to put me on a woman's model if I wanted to ride sooner rather than later, but I opted to wait for my bike. As irked as I am of not having my bike, I really appreciated the call and the fact that there was no bullshitting or beating around the bush.",positive
"From the moment you enter Trend Custom Tailors, it becomes apparent that Don Lee is an artist. The ever-evolving decor highlights much of his artistic brilliance and creativity. I must point out that this is not an alteration service where one brings their pants to be taken up an inch. This is a true Bespoke tailor shop where you will receive a personalized consultation with the tailor who will be cutting the cloth you choose, hanging your sleeves, and fitting you in your new suit at the end. The shop features glass work that the proprietor has had commissioned from students in the arts at Ryerson - one way in which he contributes back to the community, custom made iron work around the windows from local craftsmen and women, not to mention his own paintings, sculptures, and murals that demonstrate his varied artistic talents and usually incorporate a captivating blend of contrast and texture regardless of the medium. Don's passion for art and eye for fashion is carried into every garment that he makes. I have trusted Don to choose materials and patterns for me in a very consultative manner, giving him free artistic licence on the finished product, and I have never been let down. I love the way I feel in my suits from Trend. They fit perfectly. It is also nice to get frequent compliments on my shirts and suits. I'm often asked where I bought my shirts and suits, which is a great compliment to Trend's finished product. I'm pretty shocked to have come across such polarized opinions of this business on Yelp. What does NOT shock me is that both negative reviewers share something in common: a total of one review each on Yelp. I would disregard them. If you're looking for a fantastic bespoke suit, my advice is that you make an appointment with Trend and go see for yourself what all the hype is about. You will not be disappointed.",positive
"Don is making a suit for my upcoming wedding in May and the experience so far has been nothing but extremely wonderful and pleasant! Don is simply amazing - he is an artist and his pieces just speak for themselves. If I could give him 10-stars I would! Don's team is also simply wonderful. From the moment you walk in they welcome you and make you feel at home. Their attention to detail and professionalism is amazing. I highly recommend Don when you're out looking to get a suit made - it is definitely well worth it and I will definitely be back again for more clothing! BTW - I am a woman and he specializes not only in men's wear but in women's suits as well. He is rare gem in Toronto and ladies the suits are amazing! He is also in the process of remodelling a floor in his new location just for ladies! So please if you're looking for your next suit, consider Don! You won't be disappointed!",positive
"Don is a talented, polite and hard-working man. He has a great team. Their sense of fashion and professionalism are unparalleled. I wish I could buy all my clothes from Don.",positive
Im going to keep this short and civil. My experience at Trend was not as pleasant as the previous review. I find the services were subpar and the proprietors conduct was unprofessional. Not recommended.,negative
"Here I go again writing a review that will probably come back to bite me. Trend Custom Tailors is one of those rare finds you only tell your good friends about because you don't want the secret to get out and the place get too busy, but we're all friends at Yelp so why not. If there were 10 stars, I would hands down give Don (Don Fabien Lee, the owner) a full ten stars. His level of professionalism, artistry, and fashion knowhow is unmatched. All his work is tailored to your unique style, from completely conservative to the most daring of looks, but what Don does exceptionally is take conventional formal attire and fuse it with a modern, trendy flare, call it contemporary with an edge. And it so happens that style fits my taste. You can expect friendly personal attention, impeccable work, and the highest quality clothing you've ever owned, without the stuffy atmosphere and outrageous price tags. I'm not saying it's cheap but you can get a bespoke suit of better quality for comparable or lower price than the European off-the-rack suits at a Harry or Holts. Nothing I write will really do it justice; you can only understand what I mean once you put on that first suit Don makes for you. You will never go back. In fact I no longer have any use for Harry, Holt, or any of the other stores where you're supposed to buy your quality work / formal attire. I don't plan on buying a suit, jacket, shirt, or pants off the rack ever again.",positive
"Extremely helpful, friendly staff, great reasonable prices, and varied selection. By far my favorite shop in town, I go here for all my tennis needs!",positive
Family owned and operated. Tamara and Karl are wonderful and so helpful with all of my tennis needs. Tucker's Tennis has provided our team uniforms every season since they've opened. They carry the hottest new trends that makes our team stand out amongst the crowd. Thanks Tamara and Karl for all that you do.,positive
"Found this shop via Yelp, and what a GREAT little shop. So friendly from the first phone call, to getting our rackets strung. And now that my son is taking tennis a little more seriously, we need to start shopping for a better racket. They have an amazing demo program where you can demo a racket for a week for only $10. The $10 is then applied towards the purchase price of a new racket. What a great way to try out different rackets, and find the perfect one. You just can't beat that deal. They're also very knowledgeable, which is very appreciated when you've been out of the tennis scene as long as I have. =)",positive
"I have had several good experiences here, and I can honestly say I have had more GREAT buying experiences here then I can count. I have worked in the Tennis Industry for over 16 years. I have managed and owned tennis retail shops of my own in the past in various locations in the U.S. So I don't frequently see many places that I feel are exceptional... But....without hesitation.... I will say that Tucker's Tennis is the Las Vegas Valley's ONLY quintessential Tennis Pro Shop. It is locally Owned and Owner Operated by people who really care about tennis. More importantly though, Tucker's and its Ownership care about people and it shows. The store is small but packed with Several different Brands and Options for rackets, shoes, and accessories. If they don't have it, they will find a way to procure it for you. And to top all of that off, they have competitive pricing. And For Those Reasons..... 5 Stars.",positive
ok tennis players if you're like me and you need a little help finding the perfect racquet this is the place.. it's awesome that they have such an easy demo program here. it's $10 per racquet and you get to use it for one week. I'm a 3.5-4.0 player and got alot of different suggestions and actually took their advice and tried one racquet that I wanted and another that they chose. I believe this will be my tennis store from now on. another great thing is your demo rental goes towards your purchase of your racquet. how can you beat that..yes you can go online and wait for the racquet to ship to you but I like instant gratification. sometimes having a shop in town that can cater to your needs right away is something I'd pay a little more for. thank you so much guys you were so kind and helpful. my racquet purchase is definite after this demo.,positive
"Came in, the owner helped me. I was out of the game for 15 years and times have changed. She showed me the latest rackets and even custom ordered some special rackets for my kids. They gave a loaner to try after the other owner and coach guided me in the right direction. I chose the Pure Drive and they strung it, next day ready! Great service.",positive
What a hidden gem. The owner was so nice and helpful with my daughter. Great store for all your tennis needs! Definitely recommend!,positive
Great store for knick knacks and the staff in the flower shop are world class. They were good enough to put together flowers for visiting royalty. I've had several sets of flowers ordered from a distance and everytime I got massive thanks from people who were really impressed.,positive
"I had receive a beautiful arrangement from Twigs so I decided to try them out when I needed to send flowers. I picked out a very nice arrangement and filled in all the required info online to have them sent out. On the day they were to be delivered I waited excitedly for them to arrive so I could see my friends face when she received them (we work together). By 2pm they hadn't arrived so I called and asked if they could give me an update on the delivery time. The woman said they went out at 11 and should have been there by now, maybe just wait a bit longer as the drivers deliver by quadrants if the city. That sounded normal but I did point out to her that we are located less than half a block away from the store. She couldn't give me anymore info just that they would be delivered before 4 (I had specified our business hours were 9-4). I said just because that is when we are open doesn't mean I want them to be delivered just before I close. Who wants to get flowers 5 minutes before going home, you want to enjoy them all day long. She said she couldn't help me, I would just have to wait as it is a separate company that does the delivering. I waited until 3:30 and called back again, I got the same lady on the phone and she wasn't even trying to hide her annoyance with me this time. She said there is nothing she can do once they've gone out and they will be there before 4. The flowers arrived at 4:10, my friend had gone home (but did enjoy them when she came to work the next day) and I called to speak with the manager. I was told she was busy but sending her an email was a good option. I insisted on leaving my name and number and also emailed Sheila (the manager) my issue. I didn't ask to have my money back for the arrangement, they were very nice. I was just asking to have the $13 delivery fee returned as the flowers were not delivered when they said they would be. I never received a response. Because of their lack of service, I will not be shopping here ever again. If you're wondering why I would even bother having them delivered instead of walking across the street to pick them up to save myself the $13, it's because it's muh nicer having a surprise show up for you at work them someone walking in and dropping them in your desk. I know it sounds weird, but it's nicer. Anyways, I now state my hours open for delivery are 9-12 so the other florists I use don't take it so literally that it is acceptable to deliver at closing time.",negative
"I've popped into Twigs & Company a few times after having brunch downtown. I love this store. We walked in and were overwhelmed by the stunning Easter display. It was like a wonderland of sort, so much to look at. We were told that the display is constantly changing, almost weekly. The best part of this store are the staff. They have always been so attentive and friendly. We popped upstairs to the ladies boutique and played 'dress up'. I wish I got the name of the gentleman who was looking after us because he made my day. We had a blast. It never fails; we always walk out of Twigs & Company with something special. I highly recommend this store for beautiful jewelry and decorative items for the home. A cooler of lovely flower arrangements is at the back of the store. Truly a one-stop shop for everything that can make you feel special.",positive
"I live in San Francisco and wanted to use a local Calgary florist (rather than the 1-800-Flowers chain types) to send congratulatory flowers to a friend in Calgary who just had a baby. I saw the arrangements on Twigs and Co.'s website and chose the Summer Special. It was beautiful in the photos, full of roses and other pretty flowers. I liked it so much, I even added 10 bucks more for the deluxe version. The picture I received of the actual arrangement that was delivered was totally different and much less impressive. I was totally disappointed that I spent 95 bucks on such a mediocre flower arrangement delivery. Oh, speaking of delivery, they charge 13.95 for that without mentioning it. On the positive side, they did deliver when they said they would. I don't like leaving negative reviews, but I was really disappointed.",negative
"What a cute store!!! Thanks to Yelp, I'm exploring businesses I wouldn't normally get the chance to explore, and this having been said, I stumbled into Twigs just yesterday! It's a very eye catching store because there are huge windows in the front that look right into the store. The store is one of the most seasonal stores I've ever seen - what I mean is that during Halloween, it's ALL Halloween. And now, it's ALL Christmas! When you walk in, you're overwhelmed with things, things, everywhere! You almost don't know where to look first! What a lot of people don't know is that while Twigs carries all this stuff, they are also a floral shop! They have flowers for every occasion! Gifts, Decorations, Flowers, OH MY! It's definitely a one stop shop if you're on your way to someone's house for dinner and want to take along something beautiful and thoughtful. The next time I'm heading out for a soiree, I'll definitely make a pit stop at Twigs and ensure I pick up the perfect gift for the host of the evening.",positive
I'm a huge fan on the UA brand and all of their clothing. It holds up over time because of the quality and has a practical use. I find some good deals from the outlet when I go to the store and I like that can try it on there. I also order clothing online from the UA site and I'm able to return it to the outlet store if I don't like it which is nice.,positive
"I love Adidas better then UA enough said, nothing will beat the ultra boosts!!! Under amors basket ball shoes are uncomfortable would never buy shoes by them again lesson learned.",negative
"I'm a gym/exercise junkie and I appreciate high quality, affordable and comfortable athletic wear and Shoes! Under Armour hits the mark EVERY time! I can rest assured that if I'm looking for it, IT will be at Under Armour! The staff is AMAZING too! Helpful and knowledgeable and very professional!",positive
"The Under Armour outlet is a great store with many reasonably priced Under Armour clothing, shoes and accessories. Most all of the items are 40% off or you can find items on clearance that have a lower marked down price plus 30%-40% off. You have to look for the best bargains but everything is discounted which makes this store awesome compared to paying full retail price for great quality items. Highly recommend this store to anyone who loves Under Armour products.",positive
It is rare to experience customer service at this level. The entire staff was friendly and willing to go that extra step to assist us. Definitely. Way to go Under Armour!!!!,positive
"I held stocks with under armour and decided to sell based on this experience. I went on a Friday for he end of season sale. I asked a rep for a specific shoe, she said she would come back, and I waited 15 minutes before someone new comes up and asks, ""How can I help you? The other girl is busy now."" Wowzers. So they can't find my shoe color or size. I ask them to check the north premium outlet (looking for the Curry's), the rep explains that he ""made the call for another customer and knows they are out of Curry's"". Interesting. I end up traveling to the north outlet because the experience was so poor-low and behold CURRY CITY! How is it that this outlet has reps who will not call to check inventory? How is this practice of laziness and lack of service tolerable? I was so taken back that I realized this is why the UAA stock is falling, piss poor location management.",negative
"Went to under armor this past weekend and wow what a joy people on the floor very helpful. Then got to head to the check out with our boatload of shoes and couldn't get any more help than we did with Summer at he the check out stand, answering all the questions we had. She just had a smile on her face the whole time thanks again we will be back",positive
My favorite store In the whole world.. I'm a under armour brand fan and love coming here. It's easy to park and can get in and out in a jiffy. The customer service is always good and have a massive selection of clothes. Kim was great. Helped me find everything I needed.,positive
"Located at the Premium Outlets Mall south of the Vegas strip. This is an indoor mall for the most part and you'll find the UA entrance on the exterior of the mall front side. They always have discounts of at least 20% to 30% on most things and more on the clearance racks but the good stuff seems to disappear quickly. The inventory changes often so it never hurts to pay them a visit when you're passing by. They also have a nice additional 10% discount for military. It's a small store that covers both male and female products. Lots of shoes to browse through and of course workout gear galore. The staff here is friendly and ready to assist. They continually have a selection of low priced t-shirt if you can't find anything else you need (want). Being located on the exterior has a benefit in that you don't have to trudge through the mall if you don't feel like it. Just walk in and grab (and pay for) what suits you, walk out and your car is ready to take you on the rest of the journey. Get your Under Armour on!",positive
"I went in to under armor on Sunday to get a new sports bra and get my boyfriend an outfit. Everyone was so helpful!! I needed a specific size and they checked in the back, I wasn't sure about the sales and everyone gave me answers. I ended my shopping by checking out and had a friendly conversation with the cashier. Such a great experience!! I keep under armor as my top workout clothes depot!!",positive
"I tried giving this place no stars but it wouldn't allow me so I'm just putting 1 star. No greeting, no asking if we needed help (which we did), no smiles, no nothing. I took my $$ and spent it at Nike instead. Terrible salespeople.",negative
"***10% MILITARY DISCOUNT*** My favorite store in Vegas hands down! Go straight to the clearance and check out all the deals:o) You will for sure find something but even still, there's always some kind of sale going on in this place. It's not that pricey and I always get a shirt or two whenever I pay them a visit. With the HOT Vegas sun, dry fit shirts make all the difference. They truly have the best workout gear and last a long time even with excess wear. The folks who work here are also very friendly and helpful, but the 10% military discount is the reason why I go here:o)",positive
"A great place to get a wide range of workout/sports/activewear for both men and women. The store is pretty jam packed with merchandise. The only place to move around is the dressing room when trying on items. There were plenty of sales people to assist. I found the prices a bit high, but I think I am paying for a name which hopefully in turn means quality that is comfortable and durable. Remember that UA is located on the outside of the Outlet Mall.",positive
I was so excited to go to this store. I was looking for a very specific shoe that a co-worker had purchased from this store. I went to the shoes and could not find it. I was not greeted when I entered. I finally tracked down an employee and told him what I was looking for. He said they didn't have the shoe I wanted and thought they may have carried it before. I noticed a pair of boots that I thought would fit my boy. They were on a clearance rack on the back wall but were not priced. They were in a box without a price in it as well but all other items around them were 44-49.99. I asked the clerk if they had more of the boot because that would have suited my needed as well. He said that was the only pair. I left the store and then decided that I would get the boots for my son if they were on clearance and at outlet prices. I returned and again was not greeted. I got the boots and took them to the counter for a price check. The clerk said they were 119.00. I asked if that was before or after clearance. She said they were not on clearance. She was short and rude about it and said that something in the number is how I would know they were on clearance or not. I felt the experience was not worth my time going back again. Also the selection was limited in variety and sizes. I would avoid this store and shop on line in the future.,negative
"---Rant--- If I could give you guys ***more than 5 stars*** I would!!! I was looking for their discontinued RU WORTHY Hoodies. They had a few in-store but only in XL and above. Suckage since I wear a medium! I already had the blue one and wanted the faded black and great ones. Get this...the guy helping me said he'd check in the back...about 15 mins later comes out and says: UA Staff - ""We have some in that size but they are at our off-site location. I'd have to drive out and get them. It'll take about 40 mins. Would you mind waiting while I drive out there?"" Me - ""Well if it's gonna take that long I'll just come back tomorrow night. Will you be able to have them in-store by 5:30pm?"" UA Staff - ""Oh yeah for sure. I'll go get them tomorrow morning. They'll be up at the front desk for you."" His manager also came out to confirm this and to get my name and number so they could contact me once they had them in-store. Went climbing all day in the canyons, got back to the store later in the evening around 5:30pm...and there they were. Two brand new RU WORTHY hoodies, one black and one grey. SO AWESOME. Not only that but they gave me an extra 20% off for the inconvenience. Original retail per hoodie: $40+. Got both for $30 and change. EXCELLENT. ---Overall--- Service: A+ Facility/Products: A+, plenty of selections, plenty of sizes available in-store and off-site Atmosphere: A+, Under Armour stores rock~",positive
"Yes...I am a fan of this Under Armour. If I am ever at the Las Vegas Outlets (South), I always make sure that I stop at this Under Armour. You never know when they get deals and when they do, they are usually a steal of a price. This store is a little smaller than other UA's out there, but it's clean, the service is good, and the selection is decent. Because this particular Under Armour is a haven for tourist or out-of-towners, a lot of their stuff can be sold out by the time you arrive. Always happens to me when I arrive here. I see something, walk the mall, come back and it's gone. Next time I will ask them to hold whatever I'm interested in, but rarely do because I'm still in the indecisive mode. Tons of shoe deals, workout gear, hats, etc. Wish List: -I wish they would expand their line and have some of the merch that you can find in their online store. -Deals: One thing I found out is that each Under Armour may have different deals. I've been to the Ontario CA location and this location on the same day. The CA location had one deal and this location didn't. I've also seen the opposite. Overall, if you're looking for comfortable workout clothing and even casual wear, stop at this Under Armour. The staff here is always ready to assist and even will go out of their way to check their back stock. Just let them know what you're looking for.",positive
"Prices are high. Staff was busy talking to one another. I accidentally pulled the wrong coupon out of my purse for 20% off (which we got from the tour of the university), and instead of saying something like ""this coupon isn't applicable,"" or ""this is for a different store,"" the clerk left it on the counter without a word, and charged me full price on the expensive ""clearance"" shirt I was trying to buy. When I took out my money, I realized my mistake and handed her the correct coupon. Perhaps communication isn't her strength, but it's not that difficult. She said ""Oh!"" That was it. Aside from that, the store had a large selection of U of WI apparel. It was a large space, so I didn't see the other stuff they were selling.",negative
I really like this bookstore. I really like that it is so much more than a bookstore. It has all the college gear that a student (or future student/parent/alum/grandparent/baby badger) would ever want. It has a great variety of books (make sure to leave about an hour to scour the basement's selection). Grab a coffee at the coffee stand near the front doors. Super cheap lattes on Thursdays! If you have a badger fan that you need an extra special gift for- THIS IS YOUR PLACE. The prices are not super cheap; but I have seen more expensive gear at other places. Their selection of art supplies is pretty cool too. I never leave empty handed...,positive
"Typical of any college town book store: it had books, it had clothing, it even had stationary...all the essentials for any college student, alumni, or out of town visitor",positive
"I was a student once (and no, not a long time ago you jerks), and I worked in customer service once for over five years. Yes, it sucks sometimes, and sometimes there are days where you're just completely over it. But it's ridiculous here. Every single person who works here gives absolutely no shits about their jobs. A friend and I came in here to pick up some souvenir stuff, and we had a few questions about some merchandise. The kids here act like they're doing you a favor by working there, even though a majority of them were just chatting away about their weekend plans or sitting at the register while on their phones. We wanted to know the price of a duffel bag they had on display, and if it was available for sale since it had no tags. We literally had to ask three different people before we got a straight answer. Each one of them didn't know. No one bothered to try to find out, but instead just directed us to another worker. Also, I guess in this establishment it's absolutely unheard of to greet a person before speaking to them. The kid at the customer service desk actually gave me the most disgusted-weirded out look as I said hello to him before I asked a question. I actually felt like I offended him by speaking to him! It wasn't like he was busy, all he was doing at the time was folding a pile of shirts! Whatever. It's a shame, because they have a huge selection of pretty cool badger merchandise to choose from, but I'd rather give less jerky establishments on State Street my business. You don't wanna bother these guys. They've got shirts to fold.",negative
"I'm not going to talk about the books here. I remember the days (long ago) when I barely got a few bucks back for a $250+ textbook while I completely cashed in on others. What I am going to talk about the insane variety of Badger gear. And, thus, the insane amount of coin you may drop ensuring that you and every single one of your family members is outfitted in red and white. The University Book Store is a mecca of everything Bucky. Things that you couldn't even fathom to rep UW are present here. The selection is choice, the quality is high and so are the prices. Do not be shocked to see many a $65+ hoodie. It's the norm. The kiddo and baby section is especially impressive, so definitely stop by and give a look-see for any budding Badger. *Pro tip - Bathroom is in the basement (where all those glorious textbooks lie).",positive
"what a bloody place. I got a used English text book there. in the beginning of the next semester, I tried to sell it back. the first staff there told me I could get 4 some buck s if I could erase all the marks written inside. Well, all the marks were there when I bought it here. if they require every costumer to erase stuff they wrote before they sell the book, how come I got the book with marks in it. Now they require me to do this. f* ck that erase the whole book for only 4 dollars! so i left at once since I had other stuff to do. Secondly,when I came back to the book store again some hours later to see if I could argue with them. this time, it was another staff there. he told me I could get 2 dollars at most since it was an old edition. F*ck that as well! is it a private business run by individual staff there? I don't think they have a same standard to evaluate the used books. it's a bloody place after all.",negative
"The only pluses I have for the University Bookstore are (1) it's location is basically on campus and (2) it has an extensive supply of Badger gear. However, it's a bit pricey. You can easily find Badger gear (especially tshirts) elsewhere on State Street for cheaper. As an art student, I buy a lot of art supplies, and the bookstore's selection is decent, but pricier than other stores. You can find textbooks for cheaper in other places, too. Also, I've had a couple bad customer service experiences with a few of the full-time employees. Basically, unless you're really just looking for the most convenient option, you can find what you need somewhere else for cheaper.",negative
"The bookstore is, without a doubt, the most corporate bookstore in all of Madison. I'd even go so far as to label it a ""big brother"" entity. The benefits of their return policy end within the first month of the semester. I had the ink for my printer cartridge refilled, only to experience problems with it the very next day. Sometimes a student is left with no other choice, but I'd recommend any other route available, as far as buying books are concerned. Buying books online is not only cheaper, it's also worth the wait.",negative
"UBS is key to college survival; they pretty much have everything you would need in the way of textbooks, school/office supplies, badger gear, and probably stuff you didn't know you needed but upon sight, know that it should be yours. Some textbooks can be found for cheaper at other local places, and of course online shopping is always cheaper, but UBS typically has course lists of materials which you can have sent to you, put on reserve in store, or simply show up and grab what you need. I've always found the staff to be really helpful during the rush at the start of the semester, which makes everyone's lives a lot easier. Located in Library Mall, UBS is definitely convenient, and is great to shop for gifts for anyone really. The prices aren't as low as they could be, but that is to be expected by a local store who pretty much owns the college population.",positive
"I could spend all day in the UW bookstore (and have come close before!). In addition to textbooks and everything-you-ever-wanted-with-Bucky-the-Badger-on-it, they have a great selection of art supplies, pens, and random cool gift things. I love trying out all of the pens. It used to be one of my favorite things to do when a new semester would start. I would reward myself with new pens for surviving the hell that is textbook purchasing. The bookstore also has a great selection of used books for cheap. So now I can buy back all those books I wished I hadn't sold back to the bookstore to buy ramen.",positive
I love this store! Every time I've gone in they have given me excellent advice on style and current trends. I was nervous about getting a flower to pin on my jacket but after all the compliments I got on it I was hooked and have returned multiple times to upgrade my look with accessories. It's so great to have a store that just focuses on men's styles and Driss is the man when it come to dressing you in pure confidence! Thanks to the team here I will always be a client of Vercini!,positive
"I was pleasantly surprised by my encounter to this family owned business. They have beautiful items for men, all very unique and exquisite. What made my visit even better was the young man who went above and beyond to assist me in finding the perfect gift!!! I will Def recommend this amazing place to everyone who is looking for quality items and amazing customer service! Thank you guys, I will Def be back soon!",positive
This shop has amazing deals on men's fashion wear. The guy name Driss helped me put together great outfits. They tailor the clothing for a very good price. The results are fantastic. I bought three suits from them. I would highly recommend checking this place out. Amazing deals. Thanks again Driss for your help!! Definitely will come back again.,positive
Very rude sales person. Seriously zero customer service. Stay away. If you want to buy a suit with great service go to the vercini in galleria mall. Not the mimicked mile mall vercini. The sales man is seriously rude.,negative
"I came to Vegas for a wedding and my husband forgot his suit, my friend who is a lifesaver told me about this place where her husband bought his suit. This shop is located inside planet hollywood, as soon as I went into the shop we where greeted by friendly faces. Hicham was amazing, we told him are situation and that we needed a suit asap. We ended up paying less than 250 for the suit shirt tie and handkerchief which for Vegas was amazing, I once paid 7 bucks for a bottle of water here. The Suit quality was better than the one my husband forgot. They had an onsite tailor so we got the suit hemmed in less than 10 min we took longer parking the car than we did getting a suit for my husband. At the wedding my husband got many compliments on his suit.",positive
Awful place to shop. I was looking for some pants and the gentleman helping me had no idea what he was doing. I needed my pants tailored and he said he could get it done the same day and he had no idea that the tailor wasn't coming in at all! I found that to be ridiculous. My zipper had broken the same day I got them so I called and asked if I could exchange or have them fix it since I hadn't worn them long before it broke. They pretty much told me they couldn't do anything but that I could call a tailor around town. Terrible service and I do not recommend that anyone goes there to get slacks. I paid $120 for shit!,negative
"Yesterday in the mail I received a coupon for free panties when you buy one or buy any item, and a few other great coupons. I was extremely excited to use them especially when I went onto my Snapchat and saw that Victoria secret was giving away $10 off coupons naturally I went to this Victoria's Secret. Upon arriving in the store the first girl that saw me did not bother to come to me and ask me if I was looking for anything as I was actaully looking for things and wanted help and actually thought she was going to reach out to assist. Instead she continued to speak with her coworker who was off the clock. I am pretty sure this girl was the manager because she was checking bags and asking other girls if they wanted to go on the lunch. I circled around and when I still could not find what I was looking for and still have not been greeted by any other person because she was the only person on the floor I decide to go up to her at ask her about the coupon. When I asked her about the coupon she seemed like she had no idea what it was for and proceeded to tell me that it was good for both sides of the store both pink and Victoria's Secret I double asked her just to make sure because it did only say Victoria's Secret on the coupon nothing about pink. So I went about shopping and then Was forced to ask her yet another question about the sale items she was helpful but not very friendly or very interested in assisting me in purchasing a bra or showing me her favorites like normal pink associates do. As I was picking out the underwear I wanted the girl continue to talk to four of her coworkers who were leaving for the day they were chatting and calling one of the other coworkers weird not any of them decided to help me look for a pair. When I got to the front the girl was averagely nice however, they gave me a hard time about my coupon and it wasn't until I told them it was for sure for this location did they bother to look it up and find out I was in fact correct. By the way I was correct it was only for of the Victoria secret side. I left with what I was looking for but with mediocre service disappointed in this Victoria secret as the one at arrowhead mall always has tons of people in it and they still manage to keep their customer service excellent. This mall is slow and they should be eager for clients not just shoo them off and give them a I don't care attitude.",negative
"I went to this Victoria's secret yesterday, the first 3 associates didn't acknowledge me but then I came a crossed Adrianna she was great! She resized me and helped me find the right fit for my bra, she was super personable!",positive
"Worst Victoria Secret I've ever been to. I say that having visited several since in this county and others in different cities and states. Selection is limited which is expected given the location so doesn't bother me. It's the customer service that's abysmal. I'm am avid VS shopper or was...and have vsisited this location several times. Now the service here has never been great with maybe 1 or 2 staff who knew what good customer service was. They appear to have hired new staff however who are clueless about their sales and promotions, terrified about theft so are pretty offensive in their practices. One in particular requires me to practice quite a bit of restraint. I would highly recommend you not come here.",negative
I typically don't write reviews for retailers but this Victoria's Secret is the worst I've ever been to. Not only was the selection of items terrible but the store was cluttered and disorganized. After picking out a few items we waited in the long line that seemed like it wasn't moving. Instead of simply ringing customers up the sales associates were trying to sell items at the register for every single customer. It took 15 minutes to finally make us decide to leave our items and leave the store. The sales associates have no consideration for those in line and were asking the customers to go pick out more items to reach a certain amount to get a free gift. So we had to stand in line and watch people walk off to continue shopping while we wait in line for them. Waste of 45 minutes. I didn't expect to need over an hour to pick out a few items.,negative
"I was treated horribly at the PV Mall location! I was ignored multiple times by the sales girls when looking for the 2 for $40 top and yoga pants in size large. The sales reps looked past me and even helped a woman that was stealing product and looked as if she had just shot up illegal drugs! Apparently if you aren't a size 0 to 4 you can't be assisted or respected at Victoria's Secret. Once my skinny sister in law got the attention of an employee I was laughed at and told they carry x-small to medium!!! This is false if you look online but I didn't want to pay shipping... Anyhow, this all happened in front of my sister in law and daughter as well so you can imagine how horrifying this must have felt for a woman that is not an hourglass!!! I do not see myself giving one more hard earned cent to Victoria Secret. Just sad - because I like their tops but refuse to let my daughter see me treated so badly and grow up believing that is ok or that she'll have to be skinny to be respected! Very,very, very disappointed in this retailer.",negative
"This VS is abysmal. They have nowhere near the selection the Fashion Square store has and this is with regard to sizes, colors, and merchandise variety. Many bras are not in stock here that the other store has, as well as many colors/variations not in stock here. And it's very hard to find DDD cup bras that can easily be found at Fashion Square. Very frustrating experience all round. Not to mention, VS is notorious for measuring busts incorrectly and that is no different at this location. I feel like they often measure you incorrectly just to stuff you into one of their bras instead of telling you they don't go beyond a certain cup size and you'd be better served going to a retailer with a larger range of sizes. I think that's unethical and dubious. I'll stick to shopping at the Fashion Square location or the website!",negative
"Had the most dreadful experience in this awfully run store this afternoon, compelling me to write this review. What should be a place where customers receive one-on-one attention is nothing more than a self-service nightmare. Between a very new salesperson who was not even familiar with VS's new currently advertised ""multi-way"" amongst other things, a male salesperson with no follow-up and a dis-interested store manager who I pleaded for to help me and simply installed me a dressing room with 2 suggestions and left, I felt like I was in a bad dream. Determined to purchase a desperately needed bra I chose something similar to a previous purchase and got in line to pay. I was 2nd in line and waited and waited while the new, aforementioned sales gal now on cashier duty (along with the male salesperson) asked the manager for help to no avail. The manager could not be bothered though there was clearly an escalating stall at the registers. After a while, I got out of line, handing my selections to the busy, shelf-stocking manager and told her that this was a truly horrible shopping experience and good bye. She did not say a word. That is the end of me shopping there.",negative
"Had a few bad experiences unfortunately in just one visit. The associates had no intention on being courteous, they even seemed to run away or roll their eyes to avoid me. I had to walk to the cashier to ask for help, she willingly helped me, answered my questions. When I was about to walk out, the alarm went off and I was NOT even close to the door, one of the associates quickly pointed me out, and loudly said ""Can you come here I gotta check if their is anything in THERE"" meaning my bag. He gave me his back the whole time, and didn't even look at me to say I was good to go. He just said your fine. That's it. So rude.",negative
"Before now, I've never been ignored by sales associates when the store is virtually empty. Maybe the exhaustion from all of the weekend's sales drained all of the sales luster. Despite my fitting room request light being lit for over 5 min with no attendant ever coming to my assistance, I still managed on my own. Spending over $100 at an establishment deserves at least a little customer assistance.",negative
"If I could give this place zero stars, I would. Well guys, I just got back from Victoria's Secret and same old same old. I HATE coming here for a number of reasons. 1. Does anyone ever work here?? Every time i walk in theres like nobody working. i will see 2 girls at most and their always busy helping other people or ""pretending to look busy"" .. If i am lucky enough to get someones attention and speak to an associate there always so DAMN rude!! Some things i've noticed with the sales associates are their middle aged woman trying to be ""sexy"". Excuse me but its not my fault that your a middle aged woman working retail in a mall, so please change your attitude towards me and give me some service. 2. Whenever I find what I need theres hardly ever any selection, they are always out of my size or color or style and im left with the leftovers. 3. the victoria secret deals are complicated at this location. i always have a problem whenever i bring in a free panty card or a ten dollars off card. etc. they always mess up my transactions and i always have to return and fix it. and when i do try to come back and fix it im left with their attitudes again like they didnt mess anything up? i remember one time i came in and asked a sales associate if this deal was still going on where if you spend a certain amount of money say 70 bucks you get a free duffle bag.. she said yes so i did some shopping and went to check out. when i got to the register the lines were soooooo long. when i finally made it to the front and made my purchases i had noticed that the lady had forgotten my duffle bag so i went back to the store and politely told her and she responds ""oh we ran out"". excuse me?? If you had ran out of duffle bags why didnt you tell me when i had asked you when i walked in the store?? I was so angry. this is my 6th time coming back here and idk why i do, i guess I just have some sort of hope that my next visit will always be better. but no, eek, me thinks not.",negative
"Their service is horrible which is a surprise because nobody its hardly in there. I visit a VS store 2-3 times a month. I came into this site it was bout really packed I needed help and was ignored the whole time. Someone came in I heard the ""Welcome to Victoria Secret, can i help you find anything"" it kinda felt like a slap in my face. When I was paying for my stuff the woman asked if anyone helped me. I had explained to her that everyone ignored me when I seeked help m the service was horrible. All she did was continue to ignore and have a dude conversation. I ended up leaving the stuff I was going to buy because I was so disgusted.",negative
"Yup, got the $10 card as usual. Found this super cute, royal blue baby doll dress. Perfect for our anniversary next weekend ;)",positive
"-1 Couldn't find my size in the drawers. +1 A nice rep found it for me. +0 Was the wrong fit. +1 She came in and measured me and let me know my size had changed. -1 She also told me that my size will change when ""you gain 10 lbs."" Fellow Yelpers, you know there are photos on this site. That's all I'll say about that comment, which could really hurt someone's feelings if they really do have a weight issue. +1 The item was on sale! -1 No one working the register. -1 Same rep decides to avoid eye contact with me instead of pointing me to the lotion side of the store to open registers - I had no idea I was STANDING IN LINE at a set of registers that no one was even keyed in at. -1 When I do realize there are other registers open, I am nearly knocked down by another customer who had to ""beat"" me to them so she could put $13 on her VS card account. Nice work, hon.",negative
The worst VS EVER! Seriously! The store is a mess. The girls are really Rude. I would rather drive to another store then visit this one.,negative
"The worst VS I have ever visited! I browsed for about 15 minutes before one of the four employees greeted me on a slow weeknight. They were pretty busy talking and joking around with each other despite the entire store being in disarray - the panties and bras throughout were messy, unfolded and in all different size drawers.",negative
"This store is a great place to look for pink clothing or lingerie, the staff kinda follow you around and it gets kinda weird after a while but other than that I enjoy coming over here for my sexy clothes and PJ's. its worth it to get a credit card if you frequently shop here because you get lots of coupons and emails for exclusive private shopping events.",positive
"This location is amazing. Because I work on this side of town, and live in Central Phoenix- I pretty much have to drive super East or super West to get to a Victoria's Secret. This location is large, and always has lots of cute chicks working to help you along the way. I had forgotten about the semi-annual sale and was pleasantly surprised that even though I went after the prime sale time, this location still had quite a few goodies for me (I spent over $100 so clearly finding stuff wasn't an issue). I've only ever had one obnoxious customer service issue, but other than that, the girls are always super helpful and kind. If you're in the area, stop on in- this mall is notorious for it's little kiosk people being aggressive so just politely say ""no thank you"" and head to the pink monstrosity.",positive
"Everyones so pretty. The store smells so nice. As much as I despise shopping at Desert Sky Mall, I have enjoyed my visits to Victoria's Secret & Pink (which are located side by side with no divider between the stores) very much so. The employees are generally nice and it is very clean, much cleaner than some other locations I've been too.... For gifts of course.",positive
"Disgustingly dirty & understaffed! I feel bad for complaining because the girls that helped me were friendly and efficient but so can only help so many people?! Decent selection of products but footprints at the checkout counter? GROSS! & did you see the picture of the dust bunnies or maybe they should be called dust elephants?!? Fine in a pinch but don't be in a hurry.... sad really, I am sure they want more help.",negative
The employees were not super helpful and honestly a bit bratty. I love the brand. Probably will just buy online with a better selection.,negative
"I subtracted a star for customer service. As it was the semi annual sale, I would have expected to see more sales associates on the floor. Moving on. The selection of bras was great (I even scored a Bombshell on sale!), as was their lipstick/lip gloss selection for only $2.99 each! I grabbed a couple, then discovered they had 1.7 oz. perfumes, orig. $60 down to $19.99...score!! There was so much more I saw there that I wanted to buy, but I don't have an unlimited budget! After grabbing a couple more things, I breezed through the checkout. The cashier was quick and efficient. Love this location, and I will be back!",positive
Horrible customer service!!!! I will drive much further than needed in order to go to a VS that will treat me with respect and like my business actually matters.,negative
"I do all of my underwear shopping here, but today they really get an ""F"" on customer service. Sent my husband this morning to pick up specific panties for me, at 10am when they are supposed to open. He waited outside till 10:30 with no one in sight and no sign on the door. I finally reached them them via phone at noon and they said the power had been out. I asked if they could please set aside the items I had sent my husband to pick up, so that when he had to return, he could just run in and pick up. They left me on hold for awhile only to return and say they would not do that because ""my purchase $$ amount was not big enough to have one of there staff grab the items from the floor for me."" Hmmm... I guess their customer service depends on how much $$ your transaction will be. Bad business ladies!!",negative
"I've been into this store twice and each time I've been ignored. I've had several of the employees look me dead in the face and then either keep talking to each other or walk away. However, they talk to the people who walk in behind me or in front of me. It's amazing to still see such blatant racism. I usually love Victoria secret but now I'm skeptical about shopping at any of the stores.",negative
Extremely poor customer service. employees where beyond disrespectful to my mother and were trying to refuse to give her her ID back after trying to make an exchange. love the company but this location is terrible customer service.,negative
"I went in to buy myself a birthday present. They had a great deal on pink yoga pants. $25.00, I saw it online! I stood in line for 30 minutes (!!!!) while two girls rang up customers and two girls hang stuff up behind them (really? You didn't see the line with 7+ people in it??). Finally get up there and the yoga pants rang up $46. The girl went and checked and came back and said they're not $25. So I asked her which ones are then?? She took me back there and couldn't even show me. Both the girls working there said ""they're mixed in.. all over the place."" I informed them that these are on the website as $25 and all Alyssa could say is ""I'm not sure why"". Needless to say, I didn't get the yoga pants, however I did call and complained and am having them shipped to my house (at no cost because Happy Valley VS girls don't know the product they're selling!) I'm not quite sure how a store can run effectively when you don't know your sales or product. Not to mention.. people have better things to do than stand in line. Stay away from this store, at least until they get rid of there seasonal employees.",negative
Terrible customer service.. the employees while being wonderful are severely understaffed. Spending this much money for the lingerie ya think they could afford to hire more staff.. corporate greed showing up again,negative
"Super amazing customer service. They greeted us at the door. Then they figured out a couple of bras for me to try. Then those didn't work and they got my size corrected. Then they got me to try on 8 more bras. Then they suggested the perfect bra! When they didn't have it in black, they ordered it online and shipped it to my house. Seriously I already loved VS but this location is superb on their customer focus.",positive
This is my favorite VS location. They have the friendliest most helpful staff. The sales girl Alex is fabulous I would want her as an employee if I still had my retail business! Definitely a lot more fun less stressful and frustrating than shopping at the Arrowhead mall location.,positive
Angela and Bre were so helpful!!! I went in to buy some things for my daughter and Angela was very helpful. I had to go back a couple of days later with my daughter to exchange some sizes and Angela was there and remembered me and was once again very sweet! Bre ( not sure of the spelling) was very helpful at the register. This isn't really the closest store to me but it is worth the drive!,positive
"The girls working here are so helpful! I was fitted properly, and everyone was so inviting! One of the employees even help me pick out several bras that fit the style I wanted",positive
"I'm pretty sure her name is Bianca and she's so cute and helpful, she def helped me and my best friend have a great experience here!",positive
"This location only gets 2 stars because their customer service is up and down. Some girls seem genuinely nice and others are snobbish! Wish Arizona would focus on good customer service but that's a bit much to ask for I guess? One employee that was working the floor ignored me when I asked a question the first time and when she finally answered my question, she was short with me and didn't seem to care. But when another (white) customer asked her a question, she was peppy and attentative to her. She has long black hair, I might as well be describing every employee there but its worth a shot. Treat all customers with respect or at least fake it! Not going to this location again. Gbye!",negative
"Very clean place. All the employees are super nice and there is a lot of them so you don't have to wander around the store forever just to find someone to help you. The store is very organized and easy to find stuff, the drawers for certain stuff are surprisingly clean compared to other Victoria's Secret stores i've been too. The store is super big so there is definitely a lot of things in it to look for.",positive
"After frequenting countless VS stores over the years, in numerous states, and having been in the fashion & beauty industry for over a decade, I am happy to report that this VS store went above and beyond and met my needs--total client satisfaction. The staff was attentive, yet not overbearing, and more than knowledgable about their product--an obvious result of strong management training. The store was impeccable, product replenishment was plentiful, and I easily found what I needed. The dressing rooms are beautiful ( love the mirrors!) and the cashwrap experience was efficient as well. Of all the VS stores in the valley, this is the one I will be returning to. Though it may not have the wider array of selections like Arrowhead or Fashion Square does, the cleanliness, client service, and efficiency wins my loyalty.",positive
"If you are looking to travel back in time, head over to Vintage Joes! I walked in here last month and was taken back by all childhood knock knacks and old signs. Joe is also creative and makes some really cool bird houses and other things. Next time I'm in I'll be grabbing a root beer float. Joe was raving about it!",positive
"Drove pretty far for this location ! This stuff is pretty cool ! One of a kind piece, things from my childhood and the BEST root beer floats around. If anything come for the root beer floats !!!",positive
"Saw this awesome little shop from across the street and was super glad i decided to stop in. Joe (the owner) was super friendly and welcoming and my friend and i enjoyed talking to him. The shop had reasonably priced vintage items including records, board games, jewelry, and many more little treasures as well as super cool original artwork. Joe told me that the piece I bought was made with his daughters, which made it even more special! There's a soda bar and seating in the back that I'll have to check out next time! Serious collectors and curious shoppers will enjoy this place alike and i will definitely be coming back to shop and hang out with my friends! Amazing local business! #girlsrock",positive
"saw this little store from dutch bros and thought it looked cool, super laidback atmosphere including a soda bar and couches! wide variety of vintage items! vintage joe, himself, greeted us and showed us around the store :D awesome artwork and cool artsy lamps #girlsrock",positive
"This was a shop I had seen on 3TV earlier in the week. Knowing I was going to be in N. Scottsdale later this week, I made a note to stop by. I was met by Joe with a greeting and a big smile. It's a new shop, decorated with classic Americana covering the walls and the display cabinets. Myself, being a classic Vinyl record collector, gravitated to the 1970-80s records. After picking out a half a dozen items, I looked over some hand-made silver and gem stone pieces, that were made by one of Joe's older daughters. This place has been built to expand and Joe set up the back of the shop as an old fashioned Soda shop and plans for expansion to a restaurant. I think he's on to something great here! If you're a collector, there's a little something for everyone. Lunch boxes, records, the vinyl type, board games, candies, and more! I'll be sipping a classic soda in the back of the shop with a smile!",positive
"This Walmart is great. Since it's brand new & even though it's in the good hood, it's super clean, well kept & the cosmetics section is one of the best I've ever seen. They have the Maybelline Superstay Foundation & the entire color range for the brand new Covergirl foundation. The only brand they don't carry at this location Is Physician's Formula. This location also always had a huge selection of air freshener items in the cleaning aisle & that's why I keep coming back. It's smaller than a regular super Walmart but still has everything you need.",positive
"For a newer store the air conditioning is terrible! I could not even shop, I feel bad for the employees. I was told by the employees the air conditioning is controlled by a out of state company.",negative
Been here a few times and wasn't so pleased with the service. The Five stars are not for the store but for the cashier that was at register 8 today around 3:15 pm. His name was Nicholas. What a great asset to this store. He should train a lot of the other employees on how to treat customers. He went beyond his job and carried a conversation that he started just by paying attention the the items I was purchasing. Definitely Manager material. Thank you Nicholas!,positive
Trash service. A customer was saying he went to this location for 10 years and a manager said hello to him for the first time. The employees wearing a yellow vest dropped a peace of paper and started to cuss in front of a family with kids. My advice is to advoid this location.,negative
"Went here another time a couple weeks later, once again with a cart full of stuff (which we got frustrated and abandoned about $300 worth of items and this was the 3rd time I did this, never again!) we had to battle long lines, and only 2 registers open when there had to be at least 400 people in the store!! Come on!!! I will be utilizing other stores and will be researching online. This company is way to big for their britches, if you don't feel the need for customer service but there is no way we could bankrupt the evil that is Walmart so they obviously don't care because they don't need their customers to survive they already made their deal with the devil apparently.",negative
"Store is clean, but always children running around unsupervised while screaming and sketchy people everywhere. Also insane how you can have 2 lanes wrapped around the store and still remain to only have 2 lanes open... open more lanes. Literally watch employees stand around and watch the lines.",negative
"I skimmed the other reviews posted so far and I'm actually surprised no one has mentioned the NOISE. I'm between this Walmart, Christown, and the one on 35th ave and Bethany. Sure, the Metro Walmart is large and carries more products, but there's a bone jarring humming coming from the ceiling through most of the grocery section. It's this loud, deep, and vibrating hum like a thousand a/c units are about to explode on the roof or something. I've never heard a noise like this anywhere except scenes in moves when UFOs are landing. It's bad enough to where I don't like having to go to this Walmart even though I should just because of the wider selection.",negative
"Big store. Clean. Plenty of handy parking. Lots of choices. Great Location. The pickup for online ordering is right inside the door, not way back at the back of the store, so you don't have to walk a mile to get there. And....comfy chairs to sit in while they fetch your order. I love this Wal-Mart. There was even samples in the food section on the weekend, wow! Don't forget your donut at an awesome price. There is something for eveyone, and if you are not in the mood to shop, eat at the in store Subway. Place to relax.",positive
"This is a nice new store, but..... this,store has lot of problems. Twice I have gone to buy fat free milk and twice there was none. How can this happen. I also went to get syringes at the pharmacy a couple day after the store was opened they did no have any. I started to look around and found hundreds of racks and spaces empty. What gives? I also saw this through the store. I hope this is not the way the store will be managed. As usual it is the responsibility of management to keep the store shelves full. I hope because this is a new store this will cgange!",negative
"I generally don't shop at Walmart & when the moment arrives, I remember why. Today I arrived just before 7pm to pickup an online order. I checked in . There are no clear instructions on what to do after check in. So I sat down & waited. The unhappy service members never asked if I needed assistance nor acknowledged my presence. So I approach June, who told me I needed to tell "" the other girl when she shows up"" I asked if there was a large cart bcuz I was to pick up a large item. She walkie-talkied someone to bring the cart. I noticed the item ordered sitting along the isle. I asked Chris & he in turn asked June who then asked another associate to do the transaction because she didn't want to. QUOTE. For a new store that just opened it was quite a show. I only went upon a request. I won't shop at Walmart even tho I was tempted to purchase a TV. But even the low price couldn't persuade me due to the terrible customer service. I know that my experience doesn't really matter in the eyes of Walmart - but it matters to me. But they have plenty of parking - only good thing I experienced.",negative
Black Friday ad says they have iPhone X. My husband went in the day before and asked if they had the iPhone X and the employee said they had a ton. On Thanksgiving Thursday we go in at 8pm and the employees all say they never got the shipment of iPhone X's. Went to a different Walmart and said the same thing. Frustrating!,negative
"I like this new Walmart. It is one of the super centers so it is huge. Since it was my first time I walked around for a long time before I decided to do shopping. I went back to get my cart and then went to the bedding because a friend told me they have really nice pillows at Walmart. I got a couple and I am sleeping better! It is hard to beat their prices. I found a sous vide machine cheaper than anywhere else, even Amazon. They have a large grocery section which is impressive. I buy hot dogs to give the dogs their medications and they seem to be able to beat other stores' prices by about a dollar. One thing I have not been impressed with is their steak but for the most part good stuff. I did not see any organic, free range turkeys though! One thing I thought was interesting was the store is attached to the mall but you can't enter from the mall. I guess they don't want you strolling with your shopping cart through the mall and leaving it in the mall parking!",positive
This is for the Wal-Mart at Metro Center Station Mall Phenix AZ. 1st off I never saw a bit of security. They must be to scared to go out of the store. Everything is locked down inside. I had to get a soecial associate to unlock the doubke locked security case to get a bike innertube. After paying which was a nightmare of people self checkouting and having constant additional item or over weight item issues I finally got checked out it took about 20 minutes. Two times Groups of Latinos tried to mess with me as I left the store. All I bought was a bike innertube and got messed with 2 times going to my truck. Both times they tried to grab my bag away from me. A clerk I talk to got transferred there and plans to quit if tthey can not get transferred out. Pretty bad wehen t he employees want tyo run from a store.,negative
"Usually hate Walmart but this one is new & cleaner than most. Everyone was friendly... like, ACTUALLY smiling & helpfully, plenty of parking, carts were available . No complaints. So far so good.",positive
This is my go to Wal-Mart as its close to home. I am always able find what I'm looking for and this location is hardly ever sold out on items. This location is hardly ever busy so no need to worry about long line ups!,positive
"The Walmart is at the perfect location near my house :) Have halal chicken available, ROASTED. No issues with the line-up, not like I buy 12+ items anyways from here. Has a lot of essential items and its never too busy (not sure if that is a good thing for the business).",positive
"Markham has a handful of Walmart stores. This one is the newer one out of the batch, which is located east of Ninth Line. I like this Walmart. Staff are always happy to help with you if you have any questions. Lineups are shorter here than at most Walmart stores. I can always find what I need here. Produce looks fresh every time I visit. I like the individual cheesecake slices that you can get. You can get a cheesecake slice to go or bring it to work. Perfect! Aisles are wide. I tend to get bottles of peanuts. There are plenty of varieties and decent prices. Washrooms are clean. You can get your hair done and even visit Axess Law to get a divorce, if you needed to. I'm not kidding! Talk about one-stop shopping! I wish that this Walmart were closer to my home. Otherwise, I'd be at this one more often. (24)",positive
"This is the only Walmart location I actually enjoy shopping at when I need to buy some essentials. It's spacious, CLEAN, and the staff that work here are very friendly and outgoing. The customer service counter is great and there are never long lineups like at other locations. Sometimes I wish they'd open more cash lanes, as it does get busy during peak hours. They do somewhat pressure you into getting a Walmart card, which I've noticed they have a tally chart each day by the customer service counter totaling the number of cards activated for each cashier, and I assume that they receive some type of reward at the end of day for.",positive
Still the closest Walmart to home but still doesn't have the items I sometimes want. Would rather go to Stouffville. Plus I've been screwed twice here with incorrect prices marked on the shelf as opposed to what the item scans in at. Always scan your items or check carefully when at the cashier. Either their scanning computer program is nutty or they have incompetent people inputting pricing into their system. That is why I have now lowered this location to only a one star rating.,negative
"I love this Walmart because it doesn't have a long lineup, the parking is never full and when they have things on sale, I can usually get it here. Also, it seems much cleaner here, probably because it's an isolated location. It's one of the larger centers than the ones in Markham. It's basically an isolated Walmart Supercenter store close to Boxgrove plaza and ninth line if you're ever on the border East side of markham. Other than that, it's Walmart, things they sell here are similar to the rest, prices are low, as always.",positive
Worst walk in clinic. Had to wait 1:45 mins for a 5 min check up. Better to go to a real clinic and book an appointment. Walk ins are BS and a total waste of time.,negative
"I like this location as it never feels busy. The parking lot is huge, they have a large grocery section, you can always find a shopping cart and it's never crowded as you move through the aisles. It's the exact opposite of the Markville location. I'm not crazy about their fruits, vegetables and bakery selection - quality is not as good as Longo's or Loblaws but it is much cheaper. My only real complaint is the number of cashiers. When you go ""off hours"" they often have only 1 or 2 lanes open. I waited approx 30 minutes on two occasions to get through the cash - that's just unacceptable in my opinion. They have express checkout lanes but they are useless if you have a full cart. Oh... also, why can't people return their carts after use? I'm always worried that a rogue cart is going to crash into my car. This location is particularly bad for this.",negative
The ladies in the morning are always saving my life (at the registers) They are always helping me with whatever I need. Most of them know my name and are super nice when they see me. They are so sweet to me. Super friendly and all the guys in the back are super helpful too. All of them are super nice and they've saved my life a couple times!! ;-),positive
This Walmart is so unprofessional I've been in line for 30 minutes 2nd person Sandy and Elyse then tell me they can't allow me to pay my bills.,negative
"Love this Walmart! Large parking area and prices are way more inexpensive than Smith's. The store has everything for the fridge and a small area for bathroom products like deodorant, shaving cream, hair products and feminine products. Self checkout is available and staff is good about asking if assistance is needed. Only came across two cashiers (one was rude and the other was lazy-not wanting to get receipt tape) Definitely will be back!",positive
"Horrible service!! I just went to the Walmart and per their rules and regulation we ARE able to provide online ads for price matching! I was turned away by all associations and due to my time constraint I asked for the store number and left. Upon contacting the GM she proceeded to instantly become combative and rude, her name Teresa Valdez. She advised the current GM located on the receipt Lisa Knichel was not the GM and the rule for all Walmart has always been no online ads. After disconnecting with her I did my research and found they do, so I called back. Teresa got on and started if they were not printed she would not accept and it is based on her discretion to allow, COMPLETELY UNTRUE!! I feel completely disrespected by the way I was treated and told untrue information!!!",negative
"I've seen this Walmart change with management! The department managers are always a help! Most of the time everything I need is here. The associates here actually walk with you to the items you're looking for. That's awesome! The old managements are why this store has some low ratings! This is the 1st up to date rating! Right now it is a friendly, fast, low priced, and most of the items are in stocked! Also a huge plus is the clearance area has some mind blowing sales!",positive
"I was stopping here more often than not (averaged 3 days a week), because they are close and clean. Unfortunately ELYSE at the""customer service"" desk brought it to a halt. I received a $20 bill from a debit card purchase. It wasn't accepted at the gas station, nor any of the slot machines at the gas station. I returned to Walmart thinking that perhaps they got scammed....I waited half an hour to be told it was not counterfeit, and ELYSE would know, she TOOK A CLASS ON FAKE MONEY! Well thank God, she could lecture me and accuse me of having created said money; even though she said it was real. And I had to wait for a manager's approval, so that the money-verification wizard, ELYSE, could break it for me. Wow. This was the fourth trip in three days, by the way. I said I would stop shopping with this company after they ruined my tires (yes, two! And rims) and locked my car keys inside the car. I damn sure will not voluntarily contribute any funds to a place who hires people like ELYSE. I work hard for mine, she should too!",negative

Just so sad that mgmgtm from walmart are protecting their people .the higher mgmr should see this and teach Honesty as part of Walmarts culture. so sad that this Juliet for 20$ at her age will do such dishonest act.. i came back after i post this and talk to Juliet.I told her how dishonest she was and that she will be featured in social media. She cant even look at me..she was looking down without any words to say. the supervisor asked my mom shes was with me at the time.. if i found the 20$ bill.my mom said ..how can my daughter find it..its in good hands of this dishonest woman..ewwwww embarassing place. SO AGAIN...CUSTOMERS BEWARE...,negative
I have never had a more unpleasant encounter at Walmart than I had today with Maritza She was rude from the moment I walked up to the stand to return a few items I didn't need with my receipt it's was like I was intruding on her day by just walking up and asking for her assistance then when I asked for her name she wouldn't give it to me when I asked for the manager she laughed and said really then told me to shush when I began to get upset I do not Appreciate being treated as a burden just because I need to make a return with a receipt,negative
This Walmart Neighborhood Market is a great for a quick in and out. Everything that you need (for the most part) is there. I prefer to shop here in 20 mins or less. Prices are good. Lines go quick. They have one of the best pharmacies in Vegas. The head pharmacist is a nice young guy who doesn't look like a pharmacist but is super knowledgeable. His staff is helpful also. They can fill your prescriptions pretty quickly while you shop in the store. Just keep in mind that they close for lunch so plan your trips around that time so you don't unnecessarily get angry.,positive
I ordered this chicken and it was burned beyond belief and this is definitely not the first time I am highly dissatisfied and quite frankly disappointed,negative
"I feel like this is an average, good Walmart! When I buy something, it exceeds my expectations lol. I buy dinner here a lot when I run out of money, and the hot wings are my favorite! It's got a pharmacy and 2 redbox machines inside. This store is probs the gem of the corner of stores that surround it ;)",positive
I never feel like we are getting ripped off for our hard earned money by shopping here. Reasonably priced and clean environment. I actually love it.,positive
I like to go here early in the morning because it is quiet. You can get what you need quickly without the drama of going to the big Wally World on Decatur. I only go to the big one if I absolutely cannot avoid it. They almost everything you would need so check it out! Plus it's right next to my gym so it's super coveinent!!,positive
"Wal mart Neighborhood Store - These mini Wal Marts are all over the Las Vegas area. They are open 24/7 except Christmas. The night employees do a lot of stocking and cleaning but can ring you up or answer a question. These are more like a small Albertson's or Vons, with Wal Mart prices and emphasizes food items. There are no lawn mowers, televisions. appliances, nor clothing of their Supercenters. This store has none of the ghetto, dirty, barf on the floor smells of the Craig St. Wal Mart Supercenter. They have a few of a lot of items. Prices are usually the same as their Supercenter stores. For example, their whole chicken is regularly 79 cents a pound, an 18 pack of large eggs are $2.49, and they carry most of the Wal Mart line of generic medicines like ibuprofen (generic Advil), calcium tablets, bandages, cough medicines that are far cheaper than anyone else. To get more items in a smaller store, they stack things up on higher shelves. Employees will be glad to help but you have to wait. SoI often have old ladies ask me to get something off the high shelves. though I am only 5''7"". On preparing for a feast on holidays like Thanksgiving and Christmas Eve, this store is a savior. You can get in and out within a hour, but when they have their self serve line, I've been in and out in 10 minutes buying five items. They have a small deli, small bakery, bottled water machine in store, a pharmacy, clean bathrooms, and some seasonal sales, like bedding plants in spring, pumpkins galore during Halloween, and pointsettias and Christmas trees in December. The $8.00 pointsettias were $1.00 on Christmas Eve, and the cheapskates were buying several as gifts. Employees are pretty nice, and willing to help you find something if you need it. Overall, I am a fan. This is less than a mile from my relatives, and am so glad they're around.And so far, like many Vegas grocery and dept. stores, there aren['t any one armed bandit gambling machines.",positive
"While I hate supporting Walmart, because of their exploitative employment practices, I have regularly (and shamefully) shopped at this store due to its proximity to my house. I decided to review this store, however, because on each visit I have been astounded by the incredible customer service. One time, I was shopping for items for a work event and I accidentally threw away the receipt. I called Walmart and Donna immediately offered to help. She searched for the receipt, printed it, and faxed it to me all within a few hours. She was so pleasant and accommodating on the phone. Since that visit Donna has assisted me several times to find certain items or fix the self-checkout machine (I am totally inept at those machines). She has such a warm and welcoming demeanor, and works hard to brighten the customers' days. She is such an asset to Walmart--they are truly lucky to have her on their team!! Alisha is another Walmart employee who has gone above and beyond to make my visits to Walmart memorable, in a good way! Alisha often works at the customer service desk, which I stop by frequently to get money orders. Alisha always has a huge smile on her face. She is very patient, and always confirms everything before acting--an important skill when printing nonrefundable money orders. Walmart Neighborhood Market has incredible employees who work hard to give their customers a positive experience. Walmart should work just ad hard to support these people upon whom their business relies.",positive
"walk mart strikes again! i ordered eclipse glasses online for pickup at the neighborhood maket. online order said i had to order a minimum of $30. i added to my order and there was no warning that the glasses were not in stock. in fact it said they were in stock here!! i added to my order and came to pick it up and they said oh by the way, no glasses are in stock. the whole reason i ordered was for the glasses but they conveniently didn't say they they didn't have them until pickup!! i was duped!",negative
"Deli only has 1 person working in it and they close at 8 pm. There's no consistency to what this store sells and what it doesn't sell. What I mean is you find BBQ ribs, whole rotisserie chickens, wings, or you might find zero hot food at all. The shelved products are the same way. It had no Diet Gingerale Canada Dry for 3 weeks because the vendor kept stocking regular in the Diet slot as well. Bread is the same way. You may see Sara Lee Breakfast bread once then never again. I used to buy shelled sunflower seeds in a yellow bag for a $1.93 here, but once they sold out, they never restocked the product. Shelves are stocked according to what they have to stock not to the plannagram of what should be in a certain space. It's definitely not normal to buy something at a grocery store for weeks, and then, suddenly without warning, the place where that product goes stays empty Unstocked or the wrong product is put in the wrong empty spot! Produce is going bad as well. I don't know if the store has not built up their customer base up enough since recently opening or what, but tonight I wanted Anjou fresh pears, and the ones they had were all not ripe at all or over ripe to the point of having squishy cuts and holes in them, I wanted Roma plum tomatoes but all the ones they had were way too squishy and overripe, I wanted cucumbers but all the ones they had were too short and skinny and were marked up with bruises, I wanted green bell peppers but all the ones they had were damaged or way too small like they were picked too soon. This is frustrating to go thru a produce Dept and not be able to find anything on your list that's fresh and correctly ripened. The lady that normally works in the deli is very nice but slow. If someone is ahead of you, expect to wait at least 15 minutes or longer. There's usually another 2 employees in this area, but oddly, they never assist the deli lady! This is beyond frustrating! I won't be shopping here anymore because of the inconsistencies! I can't find half the items on my shopping list because of these errors!",negative
"I despise this particular Walmart, it seems a lot more ""Walmart"" then other walmarts. Every time I pull up there are always a ton of employees smoking just in front of the door! They used to stand on the side at a table but they have all moved up front so you have to go through disgusting smoke to get inside. The inside also seems so dark all the time.",negative
"This is a very nice Walmart if you're looking to pick up some groceries, especially if you're in a hurry. They only have food and home products (hence the market name), so don't come if you're looking for electronics, toys, decor, or anything like that. The produce selection is very good and very fresh, especially for a Walmart. The dairy and meat selections are a little lacking in variety but not quality of items, same with the store as a whole. It's a smaller store, so you might not find the item you're looking for if it's a very specific product, but as a whole they seem to keep things well stocked and you should be able to find any staple foods you'd need. Also they have a ton of self-checkout lanes, so if you're looking to get in and out quickly I'd highly recommend this location.",positive
"This is not the best Walmart, for sure. Positives: Most of the few checkout people are efficient and friendly. The vision center people are good. Prices are reasonable. Parking lot is a good size. Negatives: Awful managers. There are typically long lines and few registers open. It's common to see Managers at the front of the store and workers in audio-visual and other departments having a great time chatting with each other and ignoring customers. They hid the newspaper rack in the back of the self-checkout area, so it's unavailable to other customers (response was ""corporate made us do that.""). Restocking is sporadic. Some employees (grocery restocking, cart collection) do a good job, despite poor management.",negative
"It is ok. The main problem is the workers. They are quite rude, the lines are always packed, and there is never enough registers open.",negative
Worst customer service at the service center. The person who was the manager was loud and obnoxious. All she keep saying was she didn't do the transaction so therefore she not helping us. What happen to trying to help out your customer?? She then proceed to another customer and ignore us,negative
"I really don't understand the bad reviews. I love coming to this location. It's big in space, they have a huge variety of products.",positive
"This place is always understaffed, on Sunday they had less than half of their registers open and people wrapped around the walkways, making it difficult for other shoppers to get through.",negative
"The worst Walmart I've ever been to! The store is understaffed every time I'm there. I always have to wait in long lines at the registers. The employees are rude. The store is always messy. If you can, go somewhere else!",negative
"I am giving it two stars because non food items are fine. Try to go buy everyday items, good luck! Always out of stock. How can they not keep anything stocked? Ammo selection is good but it's extremely hard to find person with key.",negative
This location is huge!! And surprisingly everytime I come here I don't wait long to check out. I've actually been here looking around and a worker has voluntarily asked me if I needed any help. I've never been to any wal-mart that's ever done that!,positive
"IMHO, the low prices are not worth the headache and aggravation of a few cash registers open and extremely poor customer service. Hell, the time it takes to wait in line isn't worth the ""savings"". Be careful when you go and sometimes it's better to park further away as to not have your car damaged by wayward shopping carts.",negative
I agree with the other post. I have never seen so many people try to get out of working. They hide in different parts of the store to avoid doing their job. I am looking at 6 employees at customer service. Only one is working. The others are all visiting with their friends.,negative
"Walmart Pharmacy sucks. Very Poor Customer Service. They are not consistent with drug pricing. Initially they said $32 for a drug I requested, when I went back in 4 days for the same drug they incremented it three fold to $94. Very arrogant and bossy behavior by pharmacists. I guess Walmart is failing because of its associates rude behavior, and customers are preferring other stores or buying online.",negative
Staff has absolutely no interest in helping you or greeting you. Young man at Subway is obnoxious. Store is not clean. Aisles are always filled with merchandise. Worst of all the lines to make a return. Girl who use to run the bakery was the only reason to go to the store.,negative

This is hands down the only Walmart I go to if possible. It's one of the newest ones in Charlotte. Always clean staff is always friendly and its Walmart so the prices are always good. They have a pretty good Garden center and the parking lot is huge so always plenty of parking. The traffic can be terrible to say the least so don't come in a hurry unless you live close by. There's also a subway inside and a gas station in the same parking lot.,positive
I spoke with an associate before driving there. They had the item and she gave me great walking directions on how to find it from the home & garden entrance. The item was priced correctly. The store was clean and other associates were friendly.,negative
This place is never stocked no matter what time or day you come here. The folks here and not helpful at all and the lay out of the store is horrible. If you forget your receipt for your groceries items that you want to return you have to walk all the way to the other side of the store and do an exchange and then walk all the way back to customer service and make the exchange there. Complete waste of time and energy. I would rather go way out of my way to Walmart in Matthews than have to deal with this one one more time.,negative

Told me they couldn't help me, and I would have to drive 30 minutes back in the other direction.... which often means they didn't want to....well turns out they can. But they made me jump through hoops for it. ""Eldrina"" smirked at me and laughed.... Seriously??? I am in a customer service job and I would never treat a client that way.....the assistant manager wad not quite as rude but was worthless.....Janae thanks for being nice too me after their crap though. Oh and now their computers are freezing....cool....I have been here 40 MINUTES!!! Ugh I hate Walmart even more than I thought I could.",negative
"I'm not normally a Walmart shopper, however this place is awesome. It has everything I need, groceries and small home supplies, all in one spot. I was able to get huge bottles of my expensive shampoo for half the price of a regular smaller bottle, and home fragrance sprays and waxes at fractions of the price of other places. The staff is friendly, the place is clean. If you need plants and gardening supplies, they have that as well. The only thing is that I would not go near the fresh meat section. Some meats on the shelf looked way past their due date.",positive
"I don't know why this Walmart was rated low, this is one of the newer locations and one of my favorite Walmarts around. I live in Gastonia but shop here with my boyfriend because it's closer to his house and they carry the cat litter that I can never find at the Walmart in Belmont or Gastonia. Walmart is Walmart but it's one of the better ones.",positive
"This store continues to operate below typical Wal-Mart, and for that matter comparable big-box store, standards. Despite being open a few years, they STILL fail to keep shelves stocked with staple items. And the outages are not temporary. I haven't seen WD-40 on the shelf once in the last 5 weeks; had to purchase at the Arboretum store, which has always seemed better managed. There's still a shortage of open check-out lanes. One Thursday morning there were no lanes open--correct, you were prohibited from buying anything because there was no one to ring it up. Employees appear pretty despondent, especially compared to nearby Wal-Marts. Overall, these symptoms speak to really shabby management. PS, 8% sales tax makes things more expensive than NC stores.",negative
"I absolutely HATE this Walmart!!!! The only reason that I come here is to try to pick up an item here or there since it's on my way home from work. However, several times I've come out empty handed because they are miraculously sold out of what ever I wanted. The management here is horrible since they can't seem to keep their shelves properly stocked. Who is in charge of ordering? It all boils down to the manager not running a tight ship. If this only happened occasionally, it would be one thing, but every time that I'm there? Also, the service desk needs additional help. One time when I went to pick up an online ""ship to store"" item, just one clerk was working the returns desk - and he had a line. He told me to go to the photo area and someone would be there. So after waiting and waiting - I checked the print-out of my order confirmation, got the store phone number, and CALLED the mgr from my cell phone - having seen his picture & name on a plaque on the wall. Lucky for him, a clerk finally showed up before he answered. I will go to the store in Indian Trail, NC (1'st choice) or the Arboretum at Pineville-Matthews & Providence Rds. (2'nd choice.) They seem to be managed much better, and rarely do they not have what I'm looking for. Enter this Walmart at your own risk - but understand that you have a big chance that whatever you went for is out of stock. Read (and believe!) the others' reviews about this store not being properly stocked.",negative
"Full-size Wal-Mart that is a hair's breadth across the border into South Carolina which means you save a few cents on your shop. It's brand new and it has the nice signage and the nice fixtures. It's a massive (i.e., normal) sized Wal-Mart so if you're shopping with folks, you'll want to plan where to meet up if you get separated. No, I'm not kidding!

"This store is like a mini Sam's club! I cant find anything and walk around and around, and end up finding things I didnt know I needed",positive
WallWallmart is falling by the wayside. All I wanted was a loaf of bread and some batteries. I got a workout trying to find both. There is something annoying about a store that is several football fields in size.,negative
"Kind of agree with S L. here... the store is nice and clean from being really new, but some of the items felt like it was lacking. This store is super clean and doubles as a grocery store (which is a good combination) when you want to buy food from somewhere. It's right on the border of SC so you get the benefit of SC taxes but just a less than 5 min drive to NC. I think I will stick to the Walmarts that are closer to my house, so no more special trips out to this one unless I am in the area.",negative
"This Walmart store is lacking merchandise and good prices. However, don't even think about writing the store with your concerns because this is the reply you get: Thank you for your inquiry regarding the price difference between individual Walmart Stores. Each store is required to manage its own inventory; therefore, prices may vary from store to store. Our store managers have the freedom to lower a price to clear out an overstock item, to reward customers with an in-store sale, or to compete with local merchants. Walmart stores also do not match prices from Sam's Clubs or advertisements outside of the store's local trade territory or from other online sellers. For more information on our pricing policy, you may contact your local store management or visit our website at walmartstores.com and search ""Price Matching"". Sincerely, Walmart Customer Careless My original letter said: ----Your Original Comments Were---- Walmart Store #4237Hello,This is regarding the Walmart Store above. I am a Walmart shopper! In this economy who isn't, right? Naturally, you can imagine how happy I was when a new SuperWalmart was going up within a few miles of my house (I had been driving 20 miles for my grocery shopping) in the past. However, I have to be honest--I am not too excited about the new store. They don't carry alot of the regular items I use; (regular Comet--the 78 cent kind not $1.12 kind, black beans and rice, tiny bath and bedding section, just to name a few). Also, if they have the item it costs more at this store, when their prices are close to HT's (Fuse is $1.00 at ALL the other Walmart's this store has it priced at $1.33 that is ONLY .10 cents cheaper that HT). I also overheard a customer talking to the pharmcist and the customer was telling the pharmacist that their medication was more expensive at this store than at any other store. This is VERY DISTURBING for a new store, especially one that was so anticipated. I am finding myself making quick runs to HT now and because the Walmart store I have been going to in Matthews is starting to have a crime element I don't care to deal with, I am beginning to shop more and more at Harris Teeter again. I was very hopeful about this Walmart Store, however, I am not now.",negative
Worst Walmart ever I had orientation there it just seem like you will never start.they wasting my time when I can be working else where,negative
This Walmart in particular was actually pretty clean. The staff was semi friendly and the produce quality was fairly similar to when I shop at Harris Teeter. I dropped a job of Apple Juice in the parking lot immediately after I'd purchased it. I walked in and explained what happened to the manager and he immediately brought me a new one,positive
Worst Walmart ever. I was in line for 15 minutes to check out and then they told me and 6 other customers were out of luck. They're closed. What a joke. This place is just awful.,negative
"I just hate this store. That is it. Parking is a beast. The store always looks like a Viking ship has invaded, pillaged and murdered most of their selection. There are always misbehaved children running around the store, not paying attention to other shoppers. The lines are always long. Never enough employees. The employees that are there always look unhappy and just sour to be there. The last 3 times we went to the store (before never going again) the fire alarms were pulled and they closed the store. There are always cops around. They search your cart when you are about to leave - which really ticks me off because we only go to walmart once a week and we usually spend upwards of $200 dollars. Please go treat someone else like a thief, not the person that just shelled out a whole boat load of money in your store. Way to treat the customers that actually help sustain your crappy business. I absolutely HATE that no one in this store speaks any type of english. I always feel like I am shopping on a strange planet where no one understands me or makes an effort to understand me. The amts of times that I get held up in a line with someone with an EBT card that doesnt speak english just stresses me out. Customer service may as well have pulled an Elvis and left the building because this location is hell on earth. We have not been to this store in a few months... we kind of dropped off the Walmart boat but if we do go, we go to the one in Matthews near Sardis. At least its not dangerous. If you can help yourself: stay away.",negative
"Rudeness reigns supreme at this place. Yeah, I know, WalMart isn't exactly the place to go if you want excellent customer service. But WOW; very few times in life have I ever been cursed at by a cashier; and the manager simply didn't care. So, I went elsewhere to buy my $200 purchase that day. I won't be going back to this location; I suggest you do the same.",negative
I've never seen a Walmart that closes. They've always been 24 hours anywhere I've been. We just got turned away at the door at 11:59 pm. Guess this is a really bad part of town if WM closes...?,negative
"Many extremely rude cashiers. There are a few that are nice so kudos to them since negativity is contagious. However, still some of the worst attitudes Ive seen and I honestly don't understand how they keep their jobs. Store is always messy but I guess thats par for the course of a walmart.",negative
"With the never ending construction on independence blvd it is difficult to get here sometimes. Huge store - has good grocery section, nice floral selection and lots and lots of the other stuff that you find at Walmart. Employees are useful, helpful and friendly. Lots of toys and pretty nice gardening center.",positive
"Simply, it's a piece of shit ! I've visited a lot of Walmart stores around the states but this one is the worst business place I've ever been. Sorry for my language, hope you get actual image of the place .",negative
"Zero stars for customer service. I spent much un-needed time in this store because the employees are unwilling to assist with helping me find what I needed. (I asked three people who were stocking shelves, you think they'd be able to help) Then after being charged twice for an item, I went to customer service and wasn't even acknowledged. The THREE employees that were there talked amongst themselves about being denied for food stamps & how to reapply. Not only did they not speak to me, they didn't even make eye contact and handed me cash back without asking if I wanted it back on my card. I can't believe adults could be so rude and incompetent and still have a job! I would be fired at my job on the spot if I treated anyone the way they treat me. Absolutely ridiculous.",negative
This store is ALWAYS very dirty and messy The aisles are always strewn with trash and the floor is dirty. Don't go there. When I need to go to Walmart I go to the one off wilkinson and Ashley,negative
"Slowest place on earth, I am so glad they gave raises to employees who do not care about actually helping people. If I was this bad at my job I would expect to be fired. Horrible, the cashier just let someone jump line because her friend had already checked out bullshit",negative
"I thought I was gonna be the only one giving them a crap score but I see it's not just me that hates this place. Guess it's a club. I only go here for 2, sometimes 3 things...toilet paper, cat litter, and cat flea meds ( a couple times a year). I try to avoid coming here so much that if I don't need both items I try to figure out a way to stretch what I have at home until I do. It's such a hassle. First off you have to park practically a mile a way everytime ( and I DO NOT go on weekends) then the things I need are at the further point from the door in the store. The last handful of times I have gone they haven't restocked anything so they have nothing I need except tp. Pointless trip and then forget trying to talk to an employee ""does anyone work here?!"" comes to mind. Additionally the other reviews have pretty much nailed it, the added element of fear from the excessive amount of cops, how it takes 20 minutes to buy 2 things at 10 pm on a Tuesday, and avoid the produce. In fact just avoid this place completely if you can. 2 stars for convenience and cleanliness but I'm just glad I found a different litter brand ( forced to after coming here three times in a row and them not having it on the shelves) I prefer at Pet Smart so I never have to step foot in here again.",negative
"Big dumb pile of bricks. Same stupid Walmart just as it was on Eastway Drive. Now its just new and cleaner soon to be dirty. Very ratchet unorganized store. It's so bad that it rubs off on the customers and they start acting crazy. We to return some moldy grapes once and at 1st they denied me. I requested a member of management and after waiting about 10mins tops she comes out just as rude and as nasty as ever. She than feels up the new grapes I got and has the NERVE to say ""They feel the same to me"" like WTF? You can't feel mood ma'am. Never AGAIN! Not if this was the last Walmart in Charlotte, I'd drive to another city to avoid this one.",negative
"THE most GHETTO poverty employee Walmart I have EVER been to! The staff there are the most obnoxious group of people I have ever encountered in my life! We are new to the area, and had to run into Walmart bc it was past midnight and they were the only store open that late and they gave me the worst taste in my mouth about being here! Thankfully, the people who work at Walmart don't define the whole area, but if they did, I would be in Misery! Won't be going back there, EVER!",negative
"I visited Walmart with my pimp today, and it was the worst experience I've ever had. There was actual human feces on the bathroom floor. There were crying children and adults at every corner. I couldn't even find the Blood on the Dancefloor cd I was looking for. Would not recommend.",negative
"5 stars for a walmart, wha the wha?! I know but seriously everything was spot on perfect. I am really more of a Target type but I was hunting cheap wine glasses which Target doesn't have. Access was easy right off Independence (must be a new thing cause I read all the reviews about access issues). Parking lot was clean and not littered with carts. Store was also super clean and staff was uber nice. Cashier was really helpful in trying to get my conditioner to ring up, should have got her name. Produce was super fresh and loads of it. Can't say enough, just a really great experience. Up yours Walmart on Wilkinson.",positive
"Walmart FAIL! I despise this store....but it was the only place open after i got off work. I was really in need of a space heater so my exposed pipes at the house wouldnt freeze. I go in with mission to ONLY get the space heater. Of course, you always end up getting $100 worth of other stuff you pass and realize you need too. So my cart is half full...and i head off to find the heater. I asked a store employee who was really nice and actually walked across the store to show me where they would be located. Of course, THEY WERE COMPLETELY OUT...in the DEAD OF WINTER. Seems to me like they would keep something like that stocked up. As i was headed up to the front to check out...i stepped away from my buggy and left it unattended while i checked something out the next aisle over. While i was away...A BUGGY THEIF totally took all my merchandise out of the cart, left it on the floor and took the buggy with them! WHO DOES THAT? I mean damn! I was actually kinda thankful, when i saw that they had 3 checkout lines of the 30 checkouts open....the lines were backed up like a clogged sewer pipe. I was over it....so i began to walk out. When i got to the exit with my phone, wallet and keys in hand....the ""greeter"" who looked like she was off an episode of ""Faces with Meth"" body checked me up and down and looked at me like i was walking out with concealed inventory. Way to make someone feel welcome in Wally World. The parking lot is confusing as hell.....in fact, trying to find your way out makes you feel like you are stuck in hell. Now i remember why i dont go to WalMart",negative
"Whoever hired Jazzman and Rodney to be managers, made a TERRIBLE mistake. They are both terrible role managers. It's no wonder why the employees are uneducated and rude like they are. It was my first visit to this store and with the HORRIBLE service that I received from Jazzman, I don't intend on shopping there again. It's apparent that neither Jazzman nor Rodney care about the service they give to customers.",negative
"This post is about the Subway in this Walmart. I had the craziest Subway experience EVER at this Walmart. First, the woman working had to run answer the phone which was no big deal since I wasn't in a rush, but then started cleaning after and left us standing there, while her co-worker took care of all the people in line behind us. Once we made eye contact she realized she'd left us standing there and came over to finish our order. Then, she asked us the same questions about the bread, cheese, toasting, and sub choice over and over again. Finally we get to deal with someone else when it comes time to put our toppings on, but little did we know that all of the workers were not properly trained. She loaded my sub so full that it was barely edible, and the sub was so drenched in oil and vinegar that I could smell it the whole way home-- THROUGH THE BAG! Haha I actually was laughing the whole time and couldn't believe how out of whack this place was but hey, it's Walmart. P.S. If the guy in front of us reads this, I hope you didn't eat all that mayo!",negative
"I am like Hailey and I rarely shop at Walmart but on this particular instance I was looking for something specific like a tea ball and Harris Teeter and Target didn't have one. So at 7pm on a Sunday I thought of what else might be open that was somewhat close and I ended up here. First off, accessing this Walmart is awkward. There's an entrance off of Pierson Rd and one off of Independence and that's it. Getting back to Independence is even more of a challenge when you actually have to go behind the old Varnador Building. Anyway, the best thing I can say about Walmart is that when they are forced to, the stores actually blend into the neighborhood pretty well. Now if they can do something about the ginormous parking lots they need. Inside the store, it's typical of a walmart. Junky products, hard to find what you are looking for and the typical inconsiderate walmart shoppers. It took me a while but I found what I was looking for and I got out of the store vowing never to come back. The tea ball was junky. Should have paid for the $12 one at Teavana. It wouldn't have broke after first use...",negative
"Walmart doesn't change much from one location to the next, and that is really part of their appeal, such as it is. This location really isn't much different in that regard. Where this location really falls down is the parking lot. Rather, leaving the parking lot. Getting into the lot is not difficult. Getting out is a nightmare. You can either leave by Independence and risk life and limb (and car), or you can exit by residential street, and end up getting on Independence in another direction, or wind your way through other residential areas and end up who knows where. There is, quite frankly, no way to get going in the correct direction if you want to end up headed in at least one particular direction. You cannot completely fault Walmart for this - it is like they took some cues from casino designers here, and the city let them. They really need to close off the outbound exit direct to Independence and create a way to get onto Albemarle to make it really accessible. In the meantime. there are other locations that are way more convenient.",negative
Black Friday was a absolute mess and this Walmart was even more terrible!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! unorganized and everything!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I was really disappointed with this Walmart!!!!!!!!!!! The TV lines were in areas that prevented people from shopping in the store............All the products were in the aisles so if you had a push buggy then you were not very mobile.....,negative
"We got dried apricots, cherries and a Nestles crunch bar. They open 6 am and close at midnight so Luis had to drive to the Walmart on Galleria to buy the fan after midnight:(",negative
"I'm not a regular Walmart shopper, but on occasion I know they have what I need and so to Walmart I go. For this location, yes, you turn right off independence into the parking lot (going east). I found a close parking spot in no time, entered and was pleasantly surprised by the cleanliness (how long will this last? only time will tell), knew the general section my item was in and found the section immediately, a few aisles later found my items, walked to express check out, had a nice chat with the woman behind me in line, paid, and out in under 10 minutes. For me, that's success at a Walmart. Had the stars aligned for me that day? Maybe. But when I only shop at Walmart a few times a year, I'll take it. All the aisles I passed had fully stocky shelves, employees actually had smiles on their faces, this is a nice step up from the one I used to visit on Wilkinson. If you need to go back west on Independence, there is a parking lot exit on Pierson that loops you back around (with plenty of signs to direct you).",negative
"I mean, its a Wal-Mart ya'll. The only thing different with this location is the pain getting back onto Independence, I can not imagine all of the brilliant car accidents that will occur with people trying to leave.",negative
"Oh! New Walmart! I came here to pick up a few items, and wow was it hard to get in and out of this place. It's right next to Independence which makes it kind of scary getting out and turning right. This Walmart is brand new and it's not bad, but I've seen better especially the way the store was built and entering and exiting the store. Since they closed the Eastway location (which is really good because that store was super old) this is the substitute location for everyone. I didn't enjoy the stone floors when you first walk in, I saw it was a problem because it was raining when I walked in and it was slippery. They do need to put in some carpets in there. This layout of Walmart is like the one in University, so if you know that store than you will be a pro in finding things at this one.",negative
"""Did you hear/see they are opening a new Walmart over on independance?"".....Why yes, yes I did hear/see that and I still have no idea why such events are noteworthy. I'm guessing it's because so many people drive by there everyday on their way in or out of the city on 74 it's just eye catching. Anyways, I went to the latest and greatest addition to charlottes big box chain stores the other day for some random item a friend wanted to pick up and as always, when you are shopping for random items, where do you head? Walmart.. that's where. The first thing I noticed about this one is the effacement on the building itself seems to be a little different than their other ones. It's brick, a little more pronounced and almost looks like they have redesigned it entirely to try and update the structure and make it look not so much Walmart-y as the standard blue and gray of the past. The inside, is just like every other walmart supercenter (clothes, groceries, etc) I've ever been in except with the added bonus of being brand it doesn't have the entirely funky old musty smell to it, just yet. I bought some groceries, my friend bought his random item of the week and we headed on out merry way. One thing that was kinda a pain in the ass about this particular store is the location isn't easy to get into and out of. We actually had to drive through a neighborhood to get there and then through another neighborhood to get back out. We probably didn't take the best route but when you are making a trip to a store that has the amazing effect of making you want to get there as fast as possible and then get the hell away as fast as possible, wrong turns can be made. The cashier lady who checked us out took about 5 minutes to ring up a clove of garlic that the guy in front of us had and actually had to first try and get a manager to help her and then pulled in another cashier who was able to score a assist and move us all along. I'm more and more becoming a fan of amazon.com for shopping for a lot random items walmart tends to carry. If you really, really, feel the need to check this one out ""the new walmart over on independance"" then go, breath in deeply of not only the people of walmart but also all that one of the good old icons of american consumerism has to offer. Otherwise, you may just want to hit a target instead.",negative
"This Walmart is pretty good compared to some that I've been in. I typically use the self checkout, which saves me time. I don't usually grocery shop here, but I might start because it is only 12 minutes away from home. The concerns I have are that they don't carry Goya products, which we consume regularly. They also don't carry the low-sodium Great Value potato and tortilla chips. They have most of the other items that I've grown accustomed to at my previous Walmarts, however. The store is clean and I haven't noticed merchandise laying in the aisles, which is a plus, and probably a fire hazard. Interestingly, there are two electric car chargers in the parking lot. Granted, I haven't seen anyone using them, but it's a cool feature. I've tried to use the auto center, but that place is jam packed, even at 8 AM on Weekends. I'm trying to decide if this or the Wadsworth location will be my go-to Walmart. I've been grocery shopping at the Wadsworth location, which also doesn't carry Goya and low-sodium Great Value stuff. Because this location is slightly closer to home, I may go here for groceries. Decisions, decisions.",positive
Walmart is Walmart. What you see is what you get. The store was relatively clean. The staff was no where to be found besides the check out area. Not much else to say besides it's Walmart.,positive
"Not surprised by all of these one star reviews. Me and my friend were just casually shopping with our shopping cart and okay yes, that cart might have been a shopping cart intended for an infant but like who can judge us for that???? We typically only shop for tiny things? So we're walking through the toy aisle, keeping it very classy, when this Walmart employee comes strolling along on her high horse with the attitude of the princess of Wales. we POLITELY told her hi and moved our tiny shopping cart out of the way, she rudely says nothing back until we decide that perhaps our cart of choice is maybe not large enough to suit our needs. When my friends goes to return the cart HERSELF out of the goodness in her pure heart, queen sassy employee says very nastily, ""I'LL PUT IT AWAY"". I'm furious about our treatment and demand her resignation. DO THE RIGHT THING, WALMART",negative
"From damage items to not so great store not one employee smiled or enjoyed there job. The staff was demoing carrots and hidden valley ranch to much ranch for only two carrots. Oh the lot attendants especially the one that wears the hat that has facial hair well he needs to change out his safety vest. Your Walmart greeter just stood there at the door never smiled welcoming people to Walmart his opening could of been Jeff Dunham favorite line "" welcome to Walmart get your shit and get out."" The question remains is the customers running the store or is the employees or management running the customers. I also later learn that most employees when you ask for help from the door greeters they wont do anything.",negative
"Always seems weird to give Walmart more than 2 stars on anything because, well, they usually suck...BUT..for all the sucky Walmart stores out there, there has to be a few good ones. This one just happens to be a pretty good one, with a fairly easy way to enter and exit the parking lot and an abundance of workers to assist in and outside of their designated departments; this place actually makes shopping pretty simple. I always enter through the garden center as it opens into the cosmetics and personal items section, to my surprise there is always a cashier in the garden section so that you can check out at the back of the store. Most departments are pretty well organized, with the occasional cluster of mess here or there. The grocery section is laid out pretty nice and in correct fashion for food shopping, hot food right by the door to lure you in with smells and warmth especially now since it is cold. An additional section of pastries and baked goods mixed in with produce from there and then down the line of dried goods, canned goods, drinks, frozen food and refrigerated items. I always go to scope out the collectible cards and figures since that area usually has closed registers and is somewhat abandoned no matter the hour. I have yet to buy a double blind box or collector card box so that is a bit of a testament in some way. BIGGEST TIP: Forget the lines no matter how many items you have and coupons? Don't worry! Just use the self check out area, there is always an attendant to be flagged down and coupons scan with no issue. Even those BUY 2 GET ONE FREE coupons, just scan it at the end and BOOM instant savings removed based on the cost of your highest item (up to listed price on coupons). So, overall not a terrible Walmart location to shop. Good layout, acceptable collectibles selection and self check outs that make life a breeze.",positive
"The recent media story regarding their toys for tots drive (obviously the vast majority of the donated toys collected outside their store, are likely purchased directly from inside), makes me angry. We just bought a $10 toy from our local GA Walmart, for this same cause 3 days ago, and now I regret spending our money to support a corporation, who obviously doesn't support their community, the armed services, or our country.

"MEDINA, OH (WOIO) - It's become a social media firestorm. For nearly 15 years, former active duty Marine John Harkness said he's been allowed by the Medina Walmart to stand inside and collect toys and money for Toys for Tots, but this week there was a change. ""They made us stay outside,"" said Harkness. ""We're there to collect toys for children that need a Christmas."" Naturally when shopper Mary Murdock saw him standing in the cold while she was shopping, she was outraged. ""I just said, why can't they put you inside? This is crap,"" said Murdock. Walmart told us ""it's policy."" Of course, it's their right to have such policies. A spokesperson issued this statement: ""Walmart's corporate policy across our more than 4500 stores does not allow this type of solicitation inside our stores and we apologize for any confusion about this policy."" The spokesperson said the current store manager is new this year and that if the Marines were allowed inside in years past, that actually broke the rules. But it doesn't make Harkness or the many viewers any more satisfied. ""It takes two seconds to do the right thing when it's cold and rainy and holiday season. You can put them in there,"" said Murdock. Walmart furthered the statement with this: ""If a Marine or anyone was treated with disrespect, that is unacceptable and we are looking into this matter further to get the facts."" While John Harkness waits for an apology and is hopeful for the change, he is thankful for all the support. Strangers bringing him coffee, sandwiches, or even just offering their support. ""It's encouraging. It's fantastic. It's good to have the general public, Vets and non-vets support you,"" said Harkness.",negative

"One experience, about 4-5 years ago, will never be forgotten from my memory until I leave this place we call Earth. On this particular visit, I simply went in to purchase a pair of cheap tennis rackets. After checking out, for some reason, I decided to glance at my receipt. For two IDENTICAL tennis rackets I was charged $12 and some change and the other was roughly $2 cheaper. Usually I let things like this go, but I was determined to get my 2 hard-earned dollars back. So I walk to the returns desk and explain the situation to the returns associate which responded with an open mouth and deer-in-headlights stare. After establishing some form of primitive communication with this poor lost soul, she paged a manager which covered the sporting merchandise. After waiting 5 minutes for this manager I grew very impatient, and began regretting my decision to get charged the correct amount. The manager finally arrived and I explained the situation. Instead of just doing the right thing and selling me the $12 racket for the cheaper one's price, I waited an additional 5 minutes for her to go to sporting goods to play detective and walk all the way back to returns. She finally arrived back and dropped the hardest retail bombshell on me. She tells the returns girl,""The one racket was priced incorrectly, they are BOTH $12 and charge him $2 more for the cheaper mis-tagged racket"". After waiting 10+ minutes to get a measly $2 back I'm being told to return what I purchased and be re-rung to pay $2 more for what they priced incorrectly!! I flipped out and explained what complete b.s. this was. All the while the customers behind me were routing me on. After all of that time wasted, I was told that I could keep the rackets for the prices I originally bought them. Instead of taking the ordeal any further, I took the high road and left Walmart the second time the same way as I left it the first...$2 poorer.",negative
"Walmart what can you expect? Well I think we should expect better! I went in to get a cell phone and stood in front of a ""sales person"" for about 5 minutes before they even acknowledged my prescience. Even with cheaper prices Its ALMOST not worth it.

"Vision Center Review ... After shopping around and comparing prices at different stores I decided to purchase lenses for my current frames at Walmart. While comparing prices I was told at Walmart that they could put the medium weight lenses in my frames for $60 with a $10 fee for doing so. So I returned a few days later and the associate that helped me this time told me I could not put lenses in my frame because whoever fitted the lenses to the frame bent the frame and it would probably break. (They were from Walmart by the way) So instead I purchased some cheap frames and what I thought was the medium weight lenses. I have extremely bad eye sight and most companies will not sell me the thickest lenses because I would not be able to see correctly with them and they would be very heavy and not fit in most frames. So I return two weeks later to pick up my new glasses and I have the heaviest thickest lenses in my new wire rim frames! I use to work at an eye doctor selling frames; thick lenses will not stay in wire rim frames! I told this sales associate that this is not what I ordered, I wanted to purchase the medium weight lenses, and that the other associates told me they were $60, She told me they were not they were $140, well before I was told the thinnest lenses were $140. Instead of correcting the order, having me pay the difference, and sending my glasses back to get them fixed she argues with me until I just give up and tell her to return them. I am not taking glasses that I would not be able to see out of, or that are going to break just because she cannot understand that the other sales associate filled out the form incorrectly and was too busy answering phones and talking about cat's to get my order correct. My boyfriend was with me when I purchased the glasses and he confirmed that he thought I was ordering the medium weight lenses as well, the problem was this woman did not know what she was selling or how to place an order. Now my eye glass prescription is expired and I have no glasses. I have been getting glasses for 23 years and this is the only time in my life this has happened to me. Worst experience I have ever had! Never go to the Vision Center in Medina go to Strongsville or something instead!",negative
My wife bought a swimwear just under two weeks ago (and decided she wasn't happy with her choice). The policy in this store said 'No Returns'. Not one mention of 'No Exchanges' on an unused swim suit. She tried to exchange her 95 dollar untouched swimsuit and was flat out rejected. Untouched. Tags on! All in the name of 'health concerns '. Interesting that other more 'reputable' stores don't have the same policy. Terrible policy and terrible store. If you buy it you better like it because you are 'out of luck' otherwise. Save your money and spend it elsewhere. Many options out there who will provide a more common sense policy.,negative
"Oh my gosh, I am IN LOVE!!! I cannot believe they have been around for 20 years and I never knew about them! Trying on swimwear is a nightmare most of the time especially when you are not a size 2 and 25 but these ladies are so helpful and their suits are for all ages and all body types! Usually, when shopping the mall I maybe can find 1 suit that sorta fits I had to choose from 5 suits that were amazing! Their prices are very reasonable for the quality for sure. Besides swimsuits, they have cute beach clothes and the best part they are NOT seasonal they have a great selection all year long!",positive
"I was disappointed with this store. There was a wide variety of bathing suites but they were all targeted to the older women. Being in my 20's I wanted a bathing suite top that was cute unique and stylish... I didn't like any to actually buy it. Lastly I thought these bathing suites were over priced. They employees were all very nice and tried helping me find what I was looking for, it just wasn't the store for me.",negative
"Not impressed. Overpriced and most of their inventory is for someone older. Sales people were nice, however pricey considering each separate was over $60.",negative
"Loved this place! Huge selection, no pressure, kind and patient women helped me find two bikinis that fit well after my recent weight loss. I went to many stores and was unable to find a single suit that fit well. Here, I found multiple suits that fit me well and looked great!",positive
"I stopped in here today on a whim. I am headed on a girls trip to the lake and thought a new swimsuit would be nice. The shop was easy to find and packed full of merchandise. I was immediately greeted when I walked in the door and asked how they could help. I explained the style of suit I was looking for and she took me right over to the style and size needed. With about six swimsuits (one and two piece) in my hands I headed for the fitting rooms. They checked on a me a couple of times and brought me an alternate size for one of the suites. I ended up selecting the very first suite she showed me after explaining what I wanted. I took my suit home and my husband loved it. I have to say the suit was on the expensive side...never have paid that much for a suit. However, being a local business I didn't mind dropping a little more knowing a majority of the money will stay in the community.",positive
"I went there to get a bathing suit for Physical Therapy and for summer. Im a busty girl... it runs in the family, and this makes finding a cute but supportive bathing suit HARD! I was told by a few people that they had a nice selection and cute suits here so I figured Id stop in and take a look. Upon being greeted, I explained my situation and what I was looking for, and the sales person looked at me like I was an idiot for having big boobs or something... Its not like I had bought the suckers, and even if I had, that would be my choice and none of their business! She was kind of rude from start to finish. Explaining that for my bust size, but small waist, that the only suits they had to offer were pretty matronly.... Im 25.... not really wanting to look like a grandma. To say the least, after the comment about me spilling out of the last suit she suggested for me (knowing my size), I left. horrible customer service =(",negative
"I've searched high and low. High end stores through TJ Maxx and Nordstrom Rack to no avail! I'm currently 4 months pregnant and still rock the bikini, but I want something supportive and adjustable while my ribcage expands but is still cute (not just a mom swimsuit)! Found EXACTLY what I wanted here. Customer service is amazing and very friendly. Range of price points and styles. I'm very happy we found this gem. Thanks yelp and other reviewers!",positive
"Looking for a Swimsuit or resort clothes? Hate trying on bathing suits? This store is for you! Even if you are a size 2 and love trying our suits this store is still for you! I am a very hard to fit swimsuit person as the top is much bigger than the bottom in terms of size and I found 7 bathing suits that fit me perfectly! Elise is amazing and they will even custom make a suit for you AT A REASONABLE PRICE! I will NEVER buy another suit in Arizona at Dillards, Macy's Target or anywhere else. In 45 minutes I had the best selection, customer service, friendly help and I never once felt like I could have found better styles or prices. Do yourself a favor....go get your swim and resort wear at What Women Want Swimwear..and you will be thanking me for writing this post!!!",positive
"I cannot believe I actually enjoyed picking out not just one, but two wonderful swimsuits. I am tall and large on top, so picking out swimsuits has always been an issue for me. After spending last week in Dillard's, looking at overpriced suits with only 1 fitting me (on top), I was shocked to find this store where I spent my lunch break trying on at least 10 suits that were made for me (I am sure there was more, but I stopped looking). The price is good and the service was wonderful. There was another customer in the store and the service provided to the two of us was very helpful. The lady knew her stuff (not the owner) and she was honest about how the suit fit on me.",positive
"This store looks like one of those thrift stores from the outside but it takes seconds before you realise that they have an exquisite collection. My mom-in-law stays away from dark coloured garments because she is dark-skinned herself. Banning 'dark' makes it even more difficult for us to find appropriate swimwear in stores that revel in gloomy spandex. After rummaging through the over-priced tacky swim suits at Nordstrom and Macy's I breathed a sigh of relief at WWWS. The lady in the store, probably the owner, assisted us as soon as we stepped in. After assessing our requirements she directed us to the right racks. My mom-in-law pulled out atleast 10 good ones in her size and fit. We walked out with a fabulous swimsuit is olive green and red.",positive
"I never realized just how hard it was to shop for a bathing suit. Since I am not of t ypical size (I refuse to go into more in this review about that), I can't go to a typical store (Everything But Water, Macy's...wherever) to find a bathing suit that fits. After going to many stores on Saturday and experiencing lyrca burn everywhere on my body...I decided to check out this store. While I feel that the customer service had a little bit to be desired, they had a wonderful selection of suits that fit any woman of any size. The bikinis had a mix of sizes...and it just wasn't the typical small - large...they went by bra sizes all the way up to size G...they cater to everybody. That alone makes it a wonderful experience. While the type of bathing I was looking for was not a speciality of theirs (Speedo - and they did carry a few), I found a suit that fit and didn't make me look like a scary slob. Also, the prices were spot on...I didn't have to pay a fortune to look good. I give it 3.5 stars....selection was great...but they lost some on the customer service. (Nice ladies...but they weren't very knowledgeable and when I walked out with the bathing suit on, they didn't say anything to me. But when I walked out with my clothes on...they asked me what I thought...a little late, I may say)",positive
Had such an amazing experience here. Ashley was super helpful. She helps out with style and looks. Great prices and amazing clothing.,positive
I was determined to buy jeans there as I have 2 friends that rave about how soft their jeans are. I walk in and both older ladies are behind the counter and there is one other person in the entire store. They don't even notice me and my 2 kids. I grab a bunch of jeans and head to the back and try them all on. I need diff sizes but no one even acknowledges me. I am done and walk out and notice one lady is now gone and there is only one other lady at the register so I just walk out empty handed. How is this store still open? They clearly aren't selling anything and there isn't any help what so ever. Customer service is clearly an unknown term here! Don't bother going to this location.,negative
"Unfortunately my experiences mirror all the previous posts. I have been shopping here a couple years now. I own a law firm. If I go in after work the staff is friendly and can't help fast enough. If I go in dressed down I am wholly and rudely ignored, EVERY TIME. I have complained a few times. Nothing changes. I'll be contacting corporate next. I shouldn't have to be in a suit to be treated with professionalism and respect. It is 100% true you are greeted and helped OR NOT based on your appearance and the day. It is never consistent and I am exhausted dealing with the never-ending flippant attitude and lack of regard for common courtesy and decency.",negative
I will be honest and say that this place is highly unprofessional. Certain subjects of matter were discussed on the floor in front of customers and calling out workers on the floor is disrespectful. Workers do not know how to dress professional for the position. I was told that I just didn't show up for work when I called in twice and had proof on my phone bill. I left my position there because of hours not working well with my college schedule and getting low hours and how unprofessional the entirety of the situation of working there with the managers and other workers. Not a friendly environment.,negative
"I completely agree with Carrie. I was in this store at the tanger outlets today having been to their other location at the Biltmore and was very displeased. No one greeted me, asked if I needed help, if I needed to try on or anything! I might have well been invisible. Originally I thought it was because I am a younger consumer and often associates don't think we are there to spend but I was prepared to buy! I bought one shirt but might have bought more had I not been eager to leave because of the lack of customer service. Most of the women working looked older like it was just a part time job to be out of the house. Either way I was not pleased. HOWEVER, the Biltmore location was a completely satisfying experience and I didn't even buy anything that day. The girls were extremely friendly and made conversation outside of what I was shopping for. So if you wish to shop this retailer I advise that location is best.",negative
"I love the clothes. BUT, I love the clothes at other places that will take a minute to say hello and find out if I need any assistance. Or eye contact instead of eyes rolled at me. This is the second time I have been in this WHBM and the customer service is the same. I got none. 5 other people walked in while I was there and each one of them received a greeting and 4 out of 5 even got conversation from the ladies that were working. I stood by a rack and watched, waiting, hoping someone working there would help me. The ladies working this particular day had a wonderful way of making me feel like I was in the wrong place and that my money should be spent elsewhere. So I did. Never again ladies. Your attitudes need serious work.",negative
"Worst service I've ever received at White House Black Market stores across the country. ""Suzy"" and ""Cory"" gave me an attitude because I wanted to exchange 3 articles of clothes that I purchased at FULL price in Feb. I didn't want my money back or even the difference all I wanted was a smaller size since I recently had a baby and lost some weight. I checked the receipt before driving 40 minutes to the outlet and it did not say anything about exchanges only about returns. As a Black Book member I've spent thousands of dollars at the other WHBM locations. Never again will I shop at any of these stores. If I wanted to be treated like my $ didn't matter then I would have gone to the local mall. Poor cashier Lena was so nervous and embarrassed it took her almost 30 minutes to process a simple size exchange. Don't waste your time or money here. Better service at the other outlets.",negative
"Obsessed! Higher end, unique, hippy dippy, fun and free spirited. This is the perfect store for anyone who likes boho/hippie styled clothing; specializing in leather goods, clothing with fringe, beading, sequins and shoes galore. You can find great gifts here (candles, jewelry, home decor, miscellaneous etc.). David, the owner, is fun and welcoming. He and his staff provide excellent, guest friendly service.",positive
"Winds of Change is a surprisingly charming boutique in Chagrin Falls. The exterior catches your eye immediately. The pink shutters are distinctly inviting on the small cottage style house, so you certainly won't miss it. I love how they have their interior decorated. It's pretty visually overwhelming--nearly every corner is packed with clothing or accessories. But it has this whimsical, pixie bohemian feel (did I just make that up?) that gives off really good vibes. I can't argue that they have an interesting jewelry collection and some really charming small gifts. It's a great place to pick up a small gift for your stylish girlfriend. The brands in the store are mixed and pricier. Many of the brands run very small, so sometimes an ""L"" looks more like a S/M. That's a bit disappointing, though its pretty standard at these higher-priced boutiques. I would give it 5 stars if it had more diverse sizes. The clothing is definitely geared towards younger gals, but the place is super cute nonetheless.",positive
"I've walked into Winds of Change a few times in the past and have always been blown away by the unique clothing, shoes, and accessories. I popped by the store yesterday but this time in need of something different...a few items that would look good on my pregnant belly! The sweet girl that was working was of great assistant and led me to just what I've been looking for. I couldn't have had more of a pleasant experience. I left a very happy lady. :)",positive
THIS IS THE ONLY PLACE I SHOP! IT IS THE BEST STORE! Everyone at WOC makes the experience life changing. The store is magical and your whole life will be transformed when you shop there. Angela and her Angels will make you feel like a goddess / princess. The store is one of the most unique places in OH.,positive
"I've been to the location in Hudson a few times and it is such a beautiful store. The owners, Angela and David, are very friendly and fashion forward. For a high end boutique, the sales associates --namely Carlyn-- are willing to help without being pushy. They all seem genuinely interested in what you want. I would recommend this store to anyone with a passion for fashion.",positive
"Really sweet clothing and accessory boutique in the heart of Chagrin Falls. This place has some of the coolest, most unique rings, necklaces and earrings I have ever seen. And reasonably priced too. Some items are made by local artists and designers. As far as clothing, there are some really high-end one-of-a-kind pieces as well as affordable items. Something for everyone. The staff is friendly and they will individually assist you in choosing the perfect outfit. WOC can also be found on Coventry.",positive
"Posting this review based on this specific worker, Adrienne. I was ready to check out but she made sure to finish her conversation with her coworker before acknowledging me. Didn't say one weird to me other than to tell me my total. When she finished bagging my stuff, she actually shoved the bag at me. Awful attitude.",negative
"Evelyn was incredible! My sister found a dress a couple weeks ago, but when we came back to the store today she could not find it. She was very upset. Evelyn stepped in right away! My sister described the dress to her and Evelyn was able to find it online and even got us free shipping. It was a great experience and we definitely felt like she cared. Thank you!",positive
"I have nothing but great things to say about the ladies that work in this store! I am a frequent shopper of this establishment and every time I shop here they always make sure I get the best experience possible. They go above and beyond to help me with my needs. Adrienne recently has helped me pick out outfits for going out of town and she nailed it! Also, Nicki helped me in the dressing room with ruling out options. So nice to know that customer service is still a priority here.",positive
This is my favorite store! I always come here when I need a dress for an event. I recently came in to look for a dress to wear at a wedding. I had something really specific in mind and Adrienne was able to pick out a dress that was exactly what I was looking for!,positive
"As we are frequent shoppers of arrowhead mall. Many stores lack great employees willing to make your shopping experience joyful and go above and beyond! My lady and I found that joyful shopping experience at this store today! Blocking out the rest of our shopping experiences with other stores in the mall that lack such good customer service. We would like to thank store manager evelyn for everything she did to help my lady with several fashion choices! We can see evelyn going far in this company and one day moving up. You are a great asset to WF ma'am, thank you... From your, Forever customers!",positive
I enjoy shopping at this store and frequent here often. I am always greeted and the Customer Service is great. They are imaginative with their clothes and accessories combo's and help me think outside of the box.,positive
"This is my all time favorite location! I've been shopping here for about 10 years and every time I walk out I'm extremely satisfied. All of the workers are great, especially Evelyn! She always helps me finding what I want and has the best service ever! I recently moved to chandler and will still make the drive to arrowhead location!",positive
"This is the high-end place, where a girl can find a dress for the ball and shoes to match. You wont find any low quality junk here; this is the prom/social event/faux wedding stuff, with sequins and tulle and lace galore. If I ever get married, I'll come look here before i ever hit the bridal shops. This is where the girls go before they hit the big chain dress departments. It makes sense, since the merchandise is all packed in close.",positive
"Love this store! The ladies in here are definitely helpful and give honest opinions about dresses. It's not only about the sales but honesty. Ashley, Sabrina and Veronica are awesome ! 10/10 I recommend !",positive
"I have stopped by a few times recently with my sister to shop for prom dresses. I have to say, it's as any other store is but for the most part always disorganized. The staff is typically friendly when checking out. However, the cleanliness of this store is unacceptable. The dressing rooms floors and baseboards looked as though they hadn't been maintained in weeks. It's not a comfortable place to set your bag down let alone walk around barefoot and what not.",negative
"I went looking for a prom dress and walked into the store already thinking it was a failed mission and that I would find nothing. The selection was AMAZING and although I did not leave with a dress, it was because of my own indecisiveness, not for lack of options. They have styles in all price ranges and I was very impressed by the helpful staff and modern styles.",positive
"Fairly like any other store. As I walked in, I was greeted by the sales lady. I looked around for some tshirts and dresses but I didnt find anything that attractive un there.",positive
"Unique & quality plus size clothing for women! A great variety of everyday and special occasion items! Wonderful style and beautifully curated! Check this place out, it's the best locally owned plus size shop I have ever been to. Zoe and her staff are knowledgable and friendly. They will give you honest opinions and help style you to perfection!",positive
"Zoe at Z Bella has a great selection of outfits - dressy and casual. As a plus-sized woman who loves fashion, I am always able to find a great outfit (or three) at Z Bella's!",positive
"Great option for full figured ladies. There is a great variety of clothing - casual, workout gear, business and evening. I get many compliments from others when I wear the clothing I have purchased from Z Bella. Staff is very knowledgeable and they help customers review different clothing options but they are not pressuring. They have sales on a regular basis and frequently post on their Facebook page. I have known about the store for about a year and I stop in about once a month to see what's new.",positive
"I absolutely love this store. The customer service is fantastic. It is a positive atmosphere. I like how roomy and comfortable the fitting rooms are. I have been to the store twice and the staff are very attentive and kind. It is a bit pricey, but I am ok with that, because I really want to support this local business, and you can tell the clothes are high quality. I look forward to many more shopping excursions here.",positive
"This store is fabulous! It caters to the 12 and up size women, real women :) and the selection is great! Zoe the owner is very helpful and just great. The selection of clothing is truly wonderful, it is wonderful to find something new! I bought a pair of pants that are just amazing and i suggest you go to this boutique and check it out!! I purchased some tanks (they are so comfortable) the fabric is amazing and the cost is great! You will be happy you took the time to visit this boutique, It is so nice to have some place other than Lane Bryant and the cheesy department store to shop in for a size 12 and up women! I have no doubt you will find something amazing.",positive
"Stopped in tonight to find a dress for some upcoming social events and I have to say this place is an absolute gem! Zoe the owner was super helpful. When she greeted me we chatted for a bit about budget, sizing issues, and types of events. She really made finding the perfect dress a painless experience, which for someone like me whose hips and bust aren't the same size can really be a challenge! Took a little time to browse around the store after I found the dress, the selection of every day casual and dressy office type clothing is great too. Buttery soft leggings and jeans... super cosy looking sweaters...flowy tops and pretty blouses... I could go on I'm already planning to stop in again as soon as I have a little money to spoil myself with! Seriously, ladies size 12 and up, if you're looking for a great place to buy fashionable clothes in Madison other than Lane Bryant; this is your store!",positive
"Great selection of clothing. They run some pretty good sales as well. Been on multiple occasions and your staff is wonderful. Particularly Chris. He went above and beyond to help me and my husband find the styles we were looking for, for our son. He's friendly, polite and very professional. His personality is a great asset to the store.",positive
"The staff here are AMAZINGGGGGGGG! Best retail store I've ever shopped at! The guys are all super friendly and helpful! Today I came in to shop for my boyfriend for his birthday and the guys were super eager and willing to help! Literally walked me around and showed me so many things and gave such great advice! This isn't the first time I've been shown such great customer service, its every time I've ever been in I've just yet to write a review! And if you're someone that likes to shop on your own, don't worry, they're all super chill, not pushy like most retail store workers... just know help is there if you need it. Thanks guys for helping me spoil my boyfriend he's gonna go nuts! Love this place!",positive
"These guys are so laid back here and allow you to feel like you're not being hounded by a sales person. But, they are so efficient and willing to help when needed. Valentino really went out of his way to help me when a sizing issue occurred with my sons shoes. I will bring shopping at this Zumiez more often with my teens. Thanks again for the 110% you gave to our shopping experience.",positive
"I was disappointed that they wouldn't return a shirt or at least give me store credit. I bought it the day before. I hadn't worn it I only removed the tags and they said that it looked worn. I've spent thousands of dollars in that store, now I won't be back.",negative
"Can j give less stars??? If you can't open the register, why open? Why open the doors if no sale can be made or returns? Just to let people look at what they can't buy? Horrible service in the last 2 days and if I ever set foot in this place again, it would be too soon.",negative
"We love this place and the staff! Mick and Kat rule. We bring our dog here! Super friendly people and fun shopping environment. I like their selection of boards, shoes and accessories. We stop by once a week.",positive
Playing repulsive music containing words and images that made me want to run from the store. I was told this is what their shoppers like to listen to. Not me. Never again and I'll warn my friends.,negative
"Came in and asked for a certain shoe in size 6 - 7 1/2. The girl working there today responded ""We only have ADULT sizes"". I have never been so insulted in my life.",negative
"Terrible customer service. if u believe those people who gave five star and saying excellent service, u would regret for what you see. There's not even a place for you to seat or rest. Those employees will not even greet with you. if you wanna have a wonderful DIY shopping day, go for it. Abercrombie could be a great choice for you, just do not imagine for any service in this shop.",negative
"God, I'd never thought I'd see the day when I'd be favourably reviewing an Abercrombie and Fitch. Sixteen year old me is slowly drawing out a gun ... Honestly though, the quality and range of clothing here is really good. As a European, I get a bit giddy coming into chains like A&F and Hollister in Canada, as the import costs are so much less here than at home, and this is reflected in the prices. Yay! I wouldn't have even thought of reviewing this place (even though I'm delighted with my new jeans), but the staff were so lovely I feel compelled to spread the word. Everyone was so helpful and polite, especially the girl in the dressing room, who kept apologising *unprompted) for the busy crowds and who went out of her way to help me with sizing. There just seemed to be a really good atmosphere in the store, and I felt the friendliness of the staff was genuine - I definitely don't get that vibe in Hollister. They definitely need more changing rooms though. There's a reason I came here to shop at 5pm on a Thursday instead of on a Saturday afternoon. This location at the weekends is a madhouse!!! Oh and yes, the smell of perfume/cologne is overkill. I can still smell it on my hands after leaving the store two hours ago - no joke. It's actually a bit nauseating walking into the store and being hit with such a strong smell!!",positive
"They keep shooting themselves in the foot. Apology after apology. Time to get their marketing chops on, and find a niche that is designed to be successful.",negative
"Extremely dark., so dark you can't see the outrageous prices properly. Unbearable cologne. The smell is so strong, you'll smell faintly like it after you walk out. Atrocious service. Most employees have enormous egos and interaction with them is very uncomfortable. Half-Hour waits for the change room during a sale. The only thing that can make this location even worse is to have naked models standing in front of the store.",negative
"This place is dark, loud, and filled with enough perfume/cologne to make me go home with a headache. Really, its so dark that I can't get a good look at the clothing they are trying to sell me. Plus, theres a bench or couch outside (can't remember) that is a constant hangout for 13 year olds - making it hard to enter or exit the store. It was one of those ""oh, cool, a new store, lets check it out!"" and after entering I immediately pulled a 180 and left. I'll be staying far, far away.",negative
"If you ever wanted proof that sex sells just look at Abercrombie & Fitch. Sex is thrown at you from the moment you enter the store. The store and clothes reek of A&F cologne/perfume to get rid of that child labor smell. The quality and originality of the clothes is poor, but you'll pay through the ass for it. They mass produce the same style each season, how many times have you seen 'A&F' stitched in white fabric over a brightly colored top? Men's tee's are designed to give the impression you are muscular; they make extra fabric in the underarms to give the illusion of ""stretch"" over your pecs and the sleeves are cut so close to the neckline to give the illusion of big shoulders. The employees are the worst, they act like being hired by A&F gives them the right to have a 'better than you' attitude. I'm convinced that it's a prerequisite for male employees to use anabolic steroids and female employees must have an eating disorder. They're not even hired to work, they're hired to sell the image of A&F. I find it hypocritical that lots of jock homophobes wear A&F yet it's a giant gay club; giant murals of half naked men are thrown in your face, the loud techno beats and overly muscular employees. When I enter the store I'm expecting to see Cher start performing.",negative
"If you're looking for boxing in the East Valley, I highly recommend this gym. It's old school, real boxing. I tried many different gyms that were just cardio style boxing, learned nothing and got bored with the workouts. This is hard and pushes me to improve every day. Trainers are knowledgeable and attentive and push you to your limits. I genuinely look forward to my training/workojts for the first time in years!",positive
"I was really excited to try a fun workout routine that would also do some damage. I showed up with a friend and two other girls who had made a reservation like the groupon specified. Well imagine our surprise when the trainer wasn't there. We made contact with him and he said to ask another trainer to get us started and he would be there soon. You should know now, that he never showed up. Secondly, the other trainer is technically a part of anther company that shares the garage. So the poor guy was stuck with clients that didn't even pay for his services. But he was willing to keep us busy with running drills, a little weights and such, but nothing boxing related. (again not his fault) he was great. But I definitely returned my groupon because the 1on1 boxing instructor definitely didn't bother to honor his own conditions. I even called him the next day to confirm that he would be there and he said of course he would. So I mentioned that I was a part of the group from that morning when he didn't show up and he said ""oh...well you were trained by (other trainers name)."" I thought that was a poor excuse.",negative
"I was interested in taking a boxing bootcamp class, did some research and found 1on1. Their pricing is reasonable, they offer monthly memberships, and they have multiple classes a day. The workouts are tough, usually there's a combination of boxing, circuit training, and Crossfit type stuff. The regulars who go to the class I went to were fun and made it a good time. So why only 2 stars? When I started, our classes were ran by a young woman name Amy. Maybe it's just a style of training, but she always seemed completely disinterested or preoccupied with something else. Then a new trainer came, Justin, and he was much more involved and encouraging during the workouts. He listened to our feedback, modified the class occasionally to meet certain needs, showed us beginner versions of the exercises, etc. He was present and attentive. He'd throw in the occasional ""good job"" or ""you're improving"" along with the ""push harder"". Those types of details make the mentally/physically tough workouts something you keep coming back to. But something happened. Justin stopped working there and it was back to Amy. And it was worse than before, she would run the class but be on her phone the whole time. Or she'd leave the room when we were doing a timed exercise and she'd have the timer! There were also those days where she would not play any music because she didn't want to listen to the radio. I'd especially look forward to the days when she'd tell us she designed that day's workout to make us throw up and proceed to sit on her butt the entire class on her phone texting/talking. She'd usually let us know that when she was training, she'd do what we were doing but 3x as hard, blah blah blah blah. I didn't realize all of this wasn't ""normal"" until I started at another boxing gym in the Valley. When I decided to not return they had started with a new trainer for the bootcamp class. He seemed to be running the bootcamp class and some other classes at the same time, so he was stretched thin. Perhaps the same thing happened with Justin. Anyway, I didn't stay to find out.",negative
I worked out at 1 on 1 boxing for a bout 6 months and I loved it! The pricing is reasonable although they really should offer a punch card for people who do other types of fitness and won't get much out of the unlimited plan. They switch out their workouts and always keep you guessing. The workouts are challenging and I saw a significant difference in my body after only 2 months. If you've never tried boxing I highly recommend it. It's a great alternative to regular cardio/weight training. I'd still be there right now but w/o air conditioning it's way too hot. I plan to return in the fall though,positive
"This place literally KICKED my butt every. single. time. I actually dreaded/hated working up the nerve to go back, but was soooo glad every single time after class. I had the livingsocial deal (unlimited month), which is pretty great deal, considering an unlimited month is $99. Yelp offers a deal to help out as well. I like how every workout is different, and you really do see results FAST. There's a new instructor now, and I feel like the classes are more conditioning/less boxing. Kinda made me feel like buying my boxing gloves was not worth it (btw, go to sports chalet for the best deal on gloves/wraps - aside from amazon!) for new-goers: go a bit early to your first class to sign-in, wrap up, and run your 1/2 mile warm up. the gym is randomly in this little office-complex like place, in the south-east corner. you can't see the door from the street, so make sure you look at the signs for the suite #; from the entrance, make a left and head to the back corner. i recommend going to the 6pm class if you can, as there are others to work out with. don't be worried about looking like a newb - there were lots of regulars, that have been doing bootcamp for YEARS, and they were still struggling. they really work you hard!",positive
Great place to work out! Jerry has been great with the kickboxing skills! He makes sure you are safe and still getting a good workout. I leave drenched in sweat every time!,positive
"Although I wouldn't consider myself uber fit, I do enjoy exercising through different types of workouts from Bikram Yoga to resistance training and hybrid boot camp type workouts. Doing both martial arts and boot camps in the past I was expecting a challenging but not necessarily a killer workout. I was wrong! Although boot camp type workouts are often challenging, I feel the classes are often watered down a bit to the level of the overall level of the group. However, at 1 on 1 boxing, if the instructors feel like you can do more, they push you to do more. If you the 10 pound medicine ball is too light, they'll give you the 12 or 15. If you are slacking on punches, they get on you to punch harder. I haven't had a workout yet that I walked away feeling unchallenged. What I do like is that the workouts vary from class to class. Some days it's all leg work (which I hate, but usually means that's what I need to work on) to boxing drills to medicine ball work to old school skip rope, running and sit ups. A big plus for me is that there is no cursing - including the music that's played. I hate cursing and the disparaging comments that often come along with it. Being vulgar doesn't make me feel more like a fighter. My only con is this. I would like them to offer another option for their classes. It seems it's just one deal with $99 for unlimited classes. If they had a punch card type system at a reasonable price I would go for it.",positive
"When I wanted to get in ultimate shape for my wedding, I knew I need a fun, varied and one-of-a-kind workout program. I found Chris at 1on1 Boxing Fitness through one of my friends. As a fitness enthusiast, I went in confident that I could keep up and not expecting much of a challenge. Evidence to the contrary. I left my first session covered in sweat and out of breath. The workout was non-stop and totally crushed my preconceived notions! The next day, muscle I didn't even know I had were sore. After 8-weeks of boxing, my arms are tighter, stomach is flatter and my legs look fabulous. If you're looking for a challenging but extremely effective workout, I highly recommend 1on1 Boxing Fitness.",positive
"Chris and his staff are amazingly committed to every client's success. The gym is open, friendly, and the workouts are intense, but also customized for every level of fitness and ability. Don't have to want to box professionally to benefit from this one-on-one approach....even my 8 yr old son is counting the days until he's able to start training with Chris! Love this gym!",positive
"Signed up for a membership in 1990, lifetime family membership in California. I continued to pay my dues each and every month regardless if I went or not. I moved to AZ Sept 2014 and notified them of the move, went to their Gilbert facility. 24 hour Fitness sold out to LA Fitness here in AZ and did not notify me. I try to go back to the gym after being on medical and found out that I cannot go so I called 24 hour Fitness. Was told by the representative that my membership should have been transferred, went into LA Fitness and was told that was not true. I was told that since my membership was bought in California that I was not eligible for the AZ transfer even though I had notified them that I live in Arizona. This transfer was 5 months ago while I was on medical, they continued to take the payments out of my account, not notifying me of the sell to LA Fitness and now they will not let me go to LA Fitness. I called 24 hour Fitness once again, was again told that they did not transfer my LIFETIME MEMBERSHIP to Arizona but I could still go in California. Why would I want to do that - what part of living in Arizona did they not understand? They will only return this month's dues and cancelled my membership. I sent an Email to their Corporate and one week later still have not heard from them. They are Liars and Cheats. DO Not GO to These people - after being a member for 27 years, they WILL NOT WORK WITH YOU! They should be sued for FRAUD.",negative
"This has been my gym for the past 2 years, it is a nice location with nice equipment and pleasant staff. There is always room to work out on whatever equipment you desire and the price is very reasonable as well.",positive
"I have been to my fair share of 24 Hour Fitness locations around the country and this is on the upper side of them. What's great about this particular location is that the clientele isn't uppity and this isn't a social scene (ahem LA Fitness). People come here to work hard and get it done. It's a clean facility and very no nonsense. You won;t find tv screen on each cardio machine here but everything works well. The group classes are great Just get there early enough to sign up and get a bright orange or pink slip to secure your place. I would recommend the Body Pump class on Thursday evenings...the instructor is fantastic at keeping you moving and keeping the class fun while being SO nice. The trainers here are really helpful and constantly offering small tips to help you with your workout such as: you will get better movement if you push your seat back a little or push your elbows in a little closer, etc. or a simple how's your workout going today?I appreciate it because sometimes I have no clue what I'm doing and I'm glad that the employees are friendly enough to stop by and help out. I did a personal training session with Adrian and I must say, if you are looking for a great workout from a very motivational trainer, you should sign up to see Adrian today. He definitely understands fitness and is constantly encouraging and helpful.",positive
"I've been to many, many gyms and this is by far my favorite one ever. It's not the biggest gym, and it's not the best, but it has THE best trainers, plenty of equipment and the nicest people you'll ever meet! It's never overly crowded, plenty of parking, they let me park my bike inside when I ride it up there and I get super fit with my awesome trainer. What's not to love? Mary, I think she's the manager, has the best sense of humor and is incredibly nice and very informed. She can answer all your questions. She also acts like she loves seeing me - ha! My fabulous trainer that beats any I've ever had, Ryan, knows his stuff. I've worked out with trainers who pushed me and hurt me, but Ryan never has. He pushes me, but safely. He's probably the most knowledgeable trainer I've ever had. He's also goofy and fun to train with. You really can't be that! This gym is above-par and I don't want to ever move because I love it so much! I hope I can work out here forever!",positive
"It appears you can't review each gym individually which is unfortunate. I would give the Val Vista location a 4 and Arizona location 2 but I can't so...here's a 3 to combine them. The Val Vista location is clean, bright and the people are friendly. They have a good assortment of classes. 10:30 group classes are geared towards seniors. If you're not a senior but new to exercising or injured, this might be a good alternative. It'll get you moving but it's not too rigorous and everyone is very friendly. I tried the yoga class and although I completely suck at it, I wasn't made to feel uncomfortable. She offered several options for different levels. I made eye contact one time and she motioned on how I could improve my posture without calling me out. Much appreciated! The 9:30 Zumba class was really good. Again, friendly trainer and classmates. I was happy to be in a class where everyone seemed real and not like they were all dressed for an audition for the next Flash Dance.",negative
"BEWARE! I believe it was back in 2007 when my best friend and I decided to get gym memberships at this 24 Hour Fitness. She signed up for the month-to-month option where they debit your monthly fee from your account. I was not comfortable with this and after severe pressure from one of the ""trainers"" (a.k.a. used car salesmen), I decided to pay ahead, IN FULL, for a 3 year membership. It was a 3 year membership, end of story - this was not a continuous membership in any way, shape, or form. My friend and I usually went to the yoga classes but we did use the machines and pool/sauna as well. I decided to bring my mom along once and let her use one of my guest passes. It was then when things turned south. One of the ""trainers"" decided to try to talk us into getting personal trainer sessions and measure our BMI, total body fat, etc. tests. After going the rounds several times as to why we weren't interested (spending about an hour of our time there), we left the gym, having not signed up for these services. Since I was already a member of the gym, this Bozo unfortunately had my phone number and began calling me, non-stop. He called about every hour or so for a few days (I am NOT over exaggerating). It got to the point where my husband had to intervene and ask him to quit calling me. The next time I went back to the gym, this ""trainer"" GLARED at me the entire time. He watched me move from machine to machine. It made me incredibly uncomfortable. I actually considered asking for special permission to move my membership to another 24 Hour Fitness, even though my particular plan was only for their gym. The location happened to be convenient for me so I thought it would be better to just call and speak to the manager instead, so I did. I called and told the manager what was happening and let him know that I was uncomfortable to use the membership for which I had paid dearly. The manager apologized and assured me it wouldn't happen again. Well, he apparently DID speak to the ""trainer,"" (as he should have) because the trainer was even more angry when I returned. He still watched me and glared, only this time, he stood up and made it very deliberately obvious that he was trying to physically intimidate me. I had had enough. I was less than a year into my three year membership but I couldn't stand going there any longer. I finally quit showing up. I really should have asked for my money back, but they had explicitly told me that it was non-refundable. I was a very busy person and didn't have the time or energy to argue the situation so I just decided to cut my losses and move on. Over two years later, my mom called me, telling me she had received something in the mail for me from 24 Hour Fitness. Odd, I thought, because I have never lived with my mom in Arizona, so how did they get that address for my name? Furthermore, I had moved to the east coast. My mom was visiting me anyway so she brought the envelope with her. I opened it up and it basically said that my membership was up and I needed to call them. Confused, I called and explained that I had paid for a 3 year membership (and that was all). I said that I wasn't sure why they assumed that I should automatically be signed up again when I didn't opt for the continuing membership. I also mentioned that I hadn't been to their gym in almost 2 years. The lady on the phone was nice and gave me a confirmation number for my ""cancellation."" I told her that didn't make any sense because there was nothing to cancel, but whatever. About two weeks later, I began to get incessant phone calls from an unknown 800 number. I Googled it to find people who were outraged - it was a collection agency for 24 Hour Fitness. Seriously, WTF?? Like I said, this was a 3 year, NON-CONTINUOUS membership. Nevertheless, I STILL called them and RECEIVED A CANCELLATION NUMBER INDICATING THAT I WOULD NO LONGER BE USING THEIR GYM! Add to all of this the harassment and physical intimidation that I had to endure by their trainer and I was LIVID! I contacted the gym and let them have it. I told them that they had sent me to collections for no reason and that their staff had harassed/intimidated me and I DEMANDED that they remove me from collections, as there was nothing to collect! I explained that my husband and I always have attorneys on retainer (this is true) and if they did not act immediately, we'd be suing. That day, they removed me from collections. I did check my credit report a while later and thankfully, there were no adverse marks from this incident on it. A few weeks later, a former coworker of mine told me that he had just been wrongfully sent to collections by the same gym. Seriously, stay away. I will NEVER have another gym membership again. I refuse to be scammed. I would rather invest that money in my own workout equipment. Thanks a lot for robbing me blind, 24 Hour Fitness!!!",negative
"I've been coming to this gym for what feels like foreverrrrrrr! lol. It has to be maybe 6 years now. =) It's not one of those glamorous gyms like Lifetime Fitness or LA Fitness but it has everything I need in a gym and I love it. Plus it doesn't cost a fortune for a membership either. But then again I signed up for one 6 years ago. It has all of your basic necessities and everyone is super friendly. I actually hate going to the gym. lol. But force myself to do so because a 6 pack abs do not just magically appear out of nowhere and neither does a toned body. lol. This location is actually a little bit farther from my house but I like how the machines are set up and how friendly everyone is so it's worth the drive for me. My only negative to this gym is they keep increasing my monthly payment. They tack on a few cents once every few months. I think they make it a small amount so you don't notice it as much but I definitely see it! I started at $18 a month 6 years ago, and now I am at $21 a month. lol. So if you just need your basic daily gym without the works at a good reasonable price, then check it out folks. =)",positive
The manager is useless. Machines are broken and never repaired for long periods of time. The only advantage to joining this club is for the hours!!,negative
Decent place. It's just so dark in there like a dungeon. I'm not sure if there trying to save money by not turning lights on but it's hard to get a good workout and have good energy in dim light. Other than that it's pretty good.,negative
I have been attending this gym now for over a year. It certainly is a no frills gym and it simply works. The staff are polite and friendly. The monthly rates are reasonable in comparison to other gyms. The child center is great. The only reason why they not get 5 stars is that they need some new flat screen TV that do not reflect!,positive
"I am commenting on the class schedules and the service I received at this gym. Coming from California, I felt like the gym I went to in SF had more flexible class times that worked with my schedule. Since I work the typical 9-6 days Monday-Friday, it is hard to find time to attend the Group X classes. I am a big fan of these exercise classes. I told myself before I would never do them but once I did, I got hooked! I haven't had the opportunity to cycle at this particular location because it is packed/booked on Saturdays morning but I have done Bodypump with Corinne here. I like the bodypump class. It is your typical bodypump class with the similar layout. Corinne is very energetic and positive. I am a little surprised that all the 24 hours gym in Arizona do NOT have towel service. Also, the machines are decent but they are a little old. The trendmills do their job but sometimes they scare me because they seem more squeaky than they should be. The fan on a few of them don't work. Also, it seems really warm in this location in the cardio section for some reason. Also, I noticed a weird odd smell when I first walk in the door. It's like a moldy, wet, chlorine smell... yuck! Bleh.",negative
"I like this gym. It's close by, it's open at ridiculous hours when one should be sleeping, but for some reason I want to be swimming or ""playing"" basketball (usually that consists of me missing the shot and running around the court chasing the ball, but at least it's 2:00am in the morning and no one else is around!!) And it's not fancy schmancy so I don't have to try too hard. ha. I've found it to be pretty clean, and I like the front desk staff. I've only tried one of the group Zumba classes because my friend was into it, but it's not really my thing. But I hear that the classes are well-attended, so if you like the group exercise dynamic they're probably good.",positive
"Pros: Clean / Few darned good trainers. Cons: Dark inside, staff changes frequently and personalities are just OK. Equipment is outdated and only the pads have ever been updated. My spouse and I had been members on and off for 8 years and mostly returned for the location factor. Recent cancellation attempts were nearly impossible. Each time my husband made the drive back there to cancel, he was told a manager must be present to cancel a membership - how terribly inconvenient and unnecessary. The THIRD and final time, I went with him to cancel. We were told the manager is ONCE AGAIN, not there, which the day before we were told she would be there. ""Cammeron"" took our information, had my husband sign a piece of paper with his login information, but nothing to show cancellation. I requested said documentation but was told the information would have to be forwarded to the manager and that she would be in the next day 9-5. I called the the following day at 12:51PM and guess what?? NO manager, again. However, a very competent sounding employee (shocker) named Gabby was very helpful and said the account showed to be canceled and no further dues would be debited...we shall see. It should be noted that we tried four times by phone to the toll-free membership services department for 24-Hour Fitness, who outsources their call center -- very frustrating. This problem was much worse the last time we tried to cancel and our dues were taken out three more months than we were told and we had to badger the former manager for our refund. Oddly enough, our address was current with the club location, but the corporate office sent a check to an old address, and they were supposed to credit our bank account. Don't waste your time. Try another gym. In fact, if you are close enough to go to Planet Fitness at Arizona Ave/Loop 202 SanTan...GO!!! No waiting for equipment, no grumpy aqua ladies that drag water ALL over the locker room like at 24 HOUR FITNESS, no annoying ZUMBA class attendants clogging the walkways, no childcare...simple, clean and friendly.",negative
"I joined 2 weeks ago. Im not impressed with this gym for several reasons.. The first week there was no paper towels in the womens bathroom for 3 days. The pool is over chlorinated, and there is (still) a dark brown scum ring all around pool tile. Some of the ""regular"" elderly ladies are rude. They make comments and glare when they get splashed, and ask you to move over beacause that is ""their spot"". The overall gym cleanliness and experinence is Meh. On a good note, I will say the pool instuctors are very nice, and I feel I get a good work out. Val, is awesome! I will stay here because is it's close, and I'm determined to get in shape!",negative
"Maybe it's just because it was my first time there (don't live in the area), but this place gave off weird vibes to me. The atmosphere reminds me of a cave and some of the weight equipment looks like it's from the '80s. Overall, I like the Mesa Riverview and the McKellips/Power locations better but this is still do-able and should have everything you need.",negative
"This place was my mainstay up until March of this year. I don't know what the heck happened, but it was like everyone started going there in January in the evening, and I felt crowded out. Mind you, NOBODY individually crowded me out! everybody was always super friendly, and I was always able to find a treadmill there. (I think I am a bit socialphobic!!) the staff there is awesome, I will always miss them! they are the best front desk gym people I know, and were always helpful, and went above and beyond to help me feel comfortable there. value wise, if you are going to pick a gym, this is the best I could find, and it is very reasonable for everything they offer. I could come here 6 nights a week, and they never made me feel like I was spending too much time in the gym. (I need it!) which I have gotten in other gyms before. the locker rooms were always clean. I really appreciated that. The jacuzzi had a weird dark yellowish tinge that looked gross, and made the place look dirty in the pool area.I never used that, I don't do yellow water EEEWWWWW! staff were aware of it, and I am sure they would have done something about it if they could have. Why the yellow water in the jacuzzi 24 hr fitness? I promise I will come back if you fix that problem! it's super gross! ok, but other than that- if that yellow Jacuzzi were missing, I'd give it 5 star.",positive
"Well, I'll start with the good things. The staff seems pretty nice, and the class instructors are pretty nice. (One of the instructors is a little weird though - I think she teaches Piyo and spin, but at least she's somewhat entertaining). I've belonged to a couple gyms, including a 24 hour fitness super sport in Oregon (Now that place was SUPER nice). This place is...just... well... eh... Actually most of the 24 hour fitness locations in the valley are just ok. They're small, crowdy, sometimes really humid and hot for some reason, and the classes are crowded and offered only at really limited times. Some of the zumba classes you have to get to over 30 minutes early, and then get a number and wait in line just to get in. What a waste of my evening! Also, you'll never find a class that starts later than 6:30pm, they just don't seem to have those, and seeing how I work 25 mins away and rarely get out before 6, it makes it very difficult to make any of their classes. Especially since (as mentioned earlier) some of them you have to get to super early just to get in! So, needless to say, I'm stuck for another year because I did the 2 year prepaid membership from costco (at least it works out to only 12$ per month), but after my membership is up I'll be going elsewhere. It's worth a little more to me for a nicer place and better class offerings. In the meantime, I'll just continue complaining to everyone who listens, and do my best working out on my own using their fitness equipment.",negative
What I like about 24 Hour Fitness is the monthly membership is very reasonable. IF you go in the early morning it's easy to get on the machines. It not fancy and I feel like I can go 'as is' ~ no one notices you. It is not a pick-up place . . . it just a nice clean place for people to exercise . . . and as a 'mature' woman I don't feel intimated. The only thing I don't care for is that they have a very limited selection of classes and times . . . and the classes they do have are to packed. I am happy they are in business. Blessings to them. : ) KC,positive
"Finally a good gym by my parent's house that I can raid on vacation. I was very wary at first when they told me I would have to pay 10 bucks a day for the week, but after a nice persistance I was abe to get a better deal. Nice equipment, not too crowded in the middle of the day, a little bit of a dirty gritty feeling after manhandling the weights but not as bad as Bally's; big open space with plenty of light, lots of machines. Wish they had these in Chicago!",positive
"They offer lots of great deals including a 24-day guest pass. It tends to get pretty busy, so you might want to go in there on off hours. Otherwise, I like this place. They just need to get more machines so I dont have to go at 8 at night or 3 in the morning to get a machine.",negative
"I am bringing down my rating to 2 stars. Yes, I did get a good deal on my gym membership at 24 hr but the fitness classes are way too packed and overcrowded! I took dance class on Saturday and it was packed with about 50-60 ladies. It was so difficult to hear the instructor and she did not give very much instruction's on how to do the dance moves correctly. I was so disappointed. I will not be renewing my membership after it expires. Until my membership expires I will stick to the treadmills, circuit training. I will continue to take my fitness classes (yoga, dance/zumba kickboxing) elsewhere, even though it's a little extra money.",negative
"Stay away. I joined the gym in 2013. It was convenient. I didn't use much in the way of different equipment, but it served it's purpose. Cleaning is a real problem. They had black stuff growing in the showers. I reported it. The manager stated he had reported it to corporate and there was nothing else he could do. It still took a few weeks to get something done after I sent pictures to corporate. Machines are not maintained. There are machines that literally have not worked properly for over 3 years. They stated they could not get parts anymore. I was in contact with corporate repeatedly. They finally stated they would reset my dues to what I started at. It seemed like there was some improvement in the cleaning. I checked my credit card statement one month and the dues were rolled back. Several months later, I checked my statement again and the dues had been raised after that one month. They lied about rolling back the dues. The manager apologized that the corporate representative wasn't clearer about the rollback of the dues but there was nothing that could be done. Obviously, they lied and hoped I would not check my statements. I liked the gym because it was convenient for me, but will not continue to patronize a business after they lie and cheat me on the dues.",negative
"Disclaimer: I've been a member since 2013 and this review is for a visit I recently took to this gym after being away using my apartment gym for a while. I also called and took a guest with me for their free 3 day pass. This review focuses on 3day passes for your guests, and my guests initial reaction. Location: I only come to this location because a long time ago the Henderson one closed down. It's a bit out of the way for someone who lived over by Wagonwheel. Now I live over by Russell and it's about 12 minutes away. It's in an easy to access spot in a nice area. Parking: Ample amounts and fairly safe, so no need to worry! Entrance: same as the other gyms, you go in an sign in at the front counter. Luckily, there were 3 people in front to help us with my guests 3day pass, 1 in which I believe I spoke with on the phone to make sure there there was a 3 day pass for new people trying the place out. PROS: -They have all you need with multiple of each. -The layout is different with a lower level and raised 2nd level. (No, they're not directly under/over each other) which is cool! Classes/personal training/etc. CONS: - Not sure if it was just today, but it Seems to be...cleanish, until you're on them, and then you see they're filthy. (ellipticals were so dirty on the bottom with grime that I could see, squeaked loudly, and were hard to use. Could make someone self conscious with all that noise) -Treadmills made the loudest noise when trying to use that I could hear myself and wanted to stop running. Luckily the other one I went on was okay afterwards. Please check these more often. -Was hard finding certain machines because I wasn't sure what was up above or below, etc. (she gave my guest a horrible tour) (but I'm sure I'd be fine after going there a couple more times) -price for new members is much higher here than at other local joints. (But they do have discounts! Depending on company of being added on, etc) ****OVERBEARING SALES PEOPLE. (As soon as we got in and signed him up to try the gym for 3 days, we were directed to a sales lady whose name I will keep anonymous. She gave us a tour that did not let my guest see much, barely gave info about the gym, and then introduced us to her boss and sat us down. NOT a good tactic. Please let people actually USE the gym before trying to sell a membership. Also, please get more informed about other gyms in the area and tell me why this one is any better. I was a sales person for 4 years...I get it, but if you're going to do it-which is already horrible at a gym that could easily sell itself if it's that great- know your stuff and do better than ""it's cheaper with this discount we've got because you're blah blah blah"" Overall... my guest will not be getting a membership and I am thinking about cancelling mine. OR we will just go to the farther locations. Although there were many, the other gym he goes to is much cleaner and the people leave you alone. You didn't give him time to even SEE or USE the gym. You also, as a sales tactic, said we had a 1 day use pass, which I argued was incorrect. I am not okay with dishonesty & needing overbearing sales people to get people to stay or create memberships. If I stay, I hope they will clean up the place and work on their sales people. Luckily I can just walk by them after entering, but I won't be referring them or bringing guests.",negative
"Be very careful in dealing with this health club chain, 24 Hour Fitness. I formerly was a member but when they increased the monthly cost at the same time they closed down the location near me I decided to cancel my membership. But then over the phone some very-rehearsed clerk sweet-talked me into ""freezing"" it instead, which meant that although my monthly charge ended, suddenly months later their substantial yearly fee appeared on my credit card statement. When I called to ask it be removed since I had stopped coming months earlier, yet another smooth-talking customer-service person got belligerent and told me ""tough sh*t too bad, read the fine print"". Unbelievable. As far as I am concerned they stole this money under false pretenses. It is devious practices like this that really chap my a$$ about underhanded American businesses. 24 Hour Fitness got plenty of money from me during the two-year tenure of my membership but still they dishonestly felt they could get away with grabbing my wallet one last time.",negative
"Old school gym with huge machine floor and free weight area. Yeah, the cardio machines are ancient but it gives it charm. Couple that with the 80s pastel colors and EKG markings on the wall and you're set! Oh, and I love that the ladies' room has a hundred toilets! No more waiting!!!",positive
I love this gym. Never packed like the other 24s even during peak hours. I usually have the whole place to myself late at night and it's so awesome! Three big rooms of machines and weight equipment. Definitely my favorite 24 in Henderson/Vegas area!,positive
24 hour fitness has the worst customer service. I am a single mom that just lost her job and I had called them to cancel my membership that I had only had for 2 months and gave me a 800 number to call. I called the nimber and she said that she could pause my membership for 3 months and that I wouldnt be charged anything a month later I get charged a annual fee. I called them back and they said that they could not refund me my money that it was a non refundable annual fee. They did not try whats so everto fix it. They will tell you anything to get your money.,negative
"I signed up for a membership last week. D helped me get all signed up, he's the best! I didn't know what I was doing except that I had intended to get a gym membership and he explained everything to me of what they offer, the classes that are included, the different locations, he covered every question and wonder I had. He was so awesome and welcoming, for that I thank him for his kindness and great customer service. Give that man a raise! Lol Since then, I've been enjoying the U-jam classes and my daily work outs. Even better that this is down the street from my house too! :)",positive
This gym is amazing. I can't believe it's averaging 3 and a half stars on yelp. Especially for an active gym. It's big. It has twice as much stuff than other 24 hour gyms. If others have one of something they have two. If others have two they have four. The gym lay out is different but nice. They had things I never saw at other 24 hour fitness. Like a treadmill rock climbing wall. The gym is old but very well kept. I like the old equipment better than what they put in the newer gyms. They even still have steal plates. I haven't seen a gym with steal plates in a very long time. They had a lot of ten pounders with rubber. Guess the tens were getting stolen. This is a great gym that's not too far from the strip and is better than the one near Fremont street. Over all this is a great gym. They could give it a paint job and new tile too make it look new and updated.,positive
"I came to this gym as a one-time guest since I live in Los Angeles. Although I told the manager several times I don't live in Nevada (even showed my California ID) to sign in, he still stayed on my ass about signing up. Even if I did leave in Nevada, I wouldn't for the life of me, join this gym. It felt very untaken care of and neglected because all the equipment was dated, rusting and unlubed causing unsmooth pushing and pulling of tension with the machines. The treadmill could barely hold my weight, I was 260 lbs at the time. The ellipticals felt like they were going to fall off the tracks. For weeks after that one visit on that one weekend I was visiting Vegas for a wedding, I was getting calls constantly asking me to talk about signing up. Not only was my phone number from Orlando Florida and my address from Los Angeles, they didn't want to give up. Eventually, they stopped bothering me...",negative
This location needs to be temporarily or permanently closed down. I went to this location because of Yelpers good reviews and boy it was disappointing and disgusting. Next to the bench press area i notice a hugh globe of mold up in the ceilings it was yellow and kinda brown so I immediately took off. It's sad to see 24 hour fitness demising throughout the years no matter it's in CA or NV.,negative
"I'm updating my review due to the fact that for the last few months I been attending, I've noticed this gym is falling apart. All the equipments are very old and not functioning correctly along with the facade of the interior as well. The gym employees here, not all but I would say half have no customer service skills. The music itself is boring, always playing old classic rock and hick music. Thank God for headphones and MP3 players or else there is just simply no motivation from the depressing music that is always playing. Mentioned it to the staff before, but unfortunately they don't seem to care. I've been a member for 20 years now, and this is one of the worst 24 I've been to. It needs a total face lift and more qualified staff.",negative
"I'm a longtime member of 24 Hour Fitness, so I thought I'd give this location a try since I had some errands to run close by. At a glance, this gym would have been almost perfect except for 3 things: The first thing I noticed when going into the men's locker room was one urinal was out of order (no biggie). I used the urinal next to it, and it damn near overflowed and almost got piss all over my shoes after flushing it. Second issue was that some of the equipment I wanted to use were missing quick links and the pins for the cable machines. I had just finished using free weights, so I was still pumped up and ready to finish my routine with the cable machines. However, my adrenaline began to fade quickly because most of the cable machines in that area were missing the damn quick links and pins. I think I spent almost 5 minutes searching that area for the links to attach the bars/d-handles. The final issue I had were the treadmills. 3 treadmills I attempted to use stop working after about 20 seconds. Their treadmills looked and operated like hand-me-down treadmills from one of those casino/hotel liquidations. I was very disappointed that I didn't get to my cardio. Even one of the staff members told me they get complaints about the treadmills after bringing it to their attention. Although the staff members were friendly, I doubt I will return to this location if the issues at hand aren't corrected.",negative
"This was my gym home when I moved to Vegas in 2005 and lived in the Southwest. This visit was my first time back in at least eight years! It really hasn't changed at all. The decor actually reminded me of the 24 I signed up at back in the 90s. This is an Active gym so no frills of the Sports or Super Sports. Just classes, cardio equipment and weights. They do have a rock climbing wall(machine) which used to be a staple in most 24s but not so much anymore. The cardio equipment is also older so don't expect a personal TV to be attached. On the plus side because it hasn't been renovated yet the weight area is more old school, spacious and user friendly. Overall, the gym is clean, staff is friendly and I didn't notice any out of order signs",positive
Gym is big and always empty. No swimming pool. But because it's empty you can almost always use multiple machines at the same time,positive
"The good: Gym is clean Nice range of classes Never busy Nice range of machines and a lot of them Not a lot steroid freaks The Bad: Equipment is very old A lot of equipment is broken, I've told the staff many times over the last few months, it never gets fixed TV's only work with an FM tuner radio, no way to plug headphones in, can't find an app that works with a phone to hear them A lot of the displays on the treadmills no longer work, can't see how fast you are going or level of incline",negative
"This location gets 5 Stars for all their 'RETRO' equipment! Equipment I haven't seen in a years! Its a nice gym, not very crowded if you like to workout in the afternoon. Found lots of different machines to have fun on. There are 3 different workout rooms with a variety of machines, cardio and yes the rock climbing wall(I will attempt that one of these days). Great workout and I will be back for sure!",positive
So much betterthan lvac much cleaner and more people who would rather just work out. not a meat market. Staff and trainers are great. This is the main one I go to but the decature one is just as good.,positive
"They nearly doubled the price while I had been seeing the same broken equipment go un-repaired for weeks. Unbelievable. Did not review my membership for this year, would rather deal with the headache of changing gyms.",negative
"Been going for the last year and a half or so and this is my favorite 24 hour fitness in Vegas, mainly because even during rush hours, it's nowhere near as busy as the 24 hour fitness on Trop/Decatur or the Gold's Gym on Stephanie/215 or even the UNLV gym. But i'm just antisocial when I work out so the less people, the better lol. That's mainly why I go late night when there's max 3 people. I think I've only had to wait on a machine one time. They offer lots of classes and I like that the weights are all together in one section and the cardio machines on the other side. Also for some reason, i've noticed less space wasters here, you know, those people that sit on a machine and text for 15 minutes lol so that's always good . Minus one star just because the machines are a little dated and it's a smaller location but overall still gets the job done :)",positive
love this 24. Open space. Not a lot of people. Not a lot of creeping looking ass people. I always get a good workout here.,positive
"I just recently got back to the gym last week after falling off the wagon :-(. However, I decided to bite the bullet and start with a trainer to get back on track and as luck would have it Nancy just started with the gym! Wow, she is great, I feel motivated, relaxed and she is a real people person! She listens to me, helps me with suggestions on where I want to get and the hour goes so quickly I can't believe it. Thank you 24-Hour fitness for bringing in a wonderful new talent just when I decided to come back and need it! :-)",positive
"Due to my rating, I feel I must start off on a positive note. The employees here are stellar! They are very friendly and appreciate the fact that you have chosen their gym to work out in. I have belonged to two other gyms before and their customer service and friendliness does not compare by a long shot. So I must say, this location has the best employees ever! Now for the ugly. This gym is completely worn down. The equipment is very old and outdated and a lot of it is either out of service or not working up to par. One morning, I jumped to three different stationary bikes until I found one that operated properly. And a lot of their stationary bikes do not have water bottle holsters, which means I have to power through 15-20 minutes of cardio with my water on the floor next to the machine and not readily available to me when I need a quick refreshment through my burn. I was a member of this gym two years ago, and was with them for four years (five years total counting when I worked out at the one near Summerlin on W. Sahara) and thought it was ok. But, in comparison to the one I worked out at off of W. Sahara and being a member of LVAC for the past two years, this location has the absolute worse gym equipment I have come across. Sad day. I have to admit that I am going to test out Club Sport here sometime soon, solely based upon the fact that this location's equipment is just lackluster, outdated and poorly maintained. I hope the manager here and the 24 Hour Fitness brand reads these reviews and does something about this. As mentioned, love the employees and the people that work out here are super nice as well, but as a gym, it just doesn't cut it. At least not for me.",negative
"I go early in the morning (when I'm in town). Staff knows you by name, equipment is clean, patrons are friendly. Weight room is in great shape, easy to get on and off equipment.",positive
"It's a pretty standard 24-hour fitness. The equipment is in good shape, the staff is friendly, and they have a decent selection of classes. Plus one for never being too busy, minus one for no pool OR rowing machine. Plus another one for being close enough to work for me to get in a pump over my lunch hour!",positive
"I visited this location while I was in town for the Mr Olympia Expo. I have to say overall I was greatly impressed. The place looked small from the outside but it was pretty large on the inside. They have tons of fitness equipment inside.some machines I have never even seen before, and the iceing on the cake was the fact that they have metal weights. I go to 24hr fitness in my home town of Murrieta CA and I wish our gym was like this one. I went at about 1am to workout so of course nobody was at the gym so I can't really say much about it being crowded. I was staying with my sister who lives off of Flamingo in Las Vegas and I wanted to go work out at Golds Gym on flamingo but it is now closed. So for now on this 24hr fitness will be my new place to train in Vegas. Loved this gym!!!! The restrooms were nice and clean and I can't say enough about the machines that they have. They have everything!!!!",positive
"I love this gym! The weight room is awesome, never full, easy to get around and get my workout done, friendly staff (except Angel, just kidding he's awesome), and I have taken one class that busted my ass. I hope they have it again. It was the NFL Combine class with Jason Beauchamp. I haven't felt my doms hit since Luke was my trainer at this gym a couple of years ago. This place is a place I can come to to get away from the everyday ho-hum adventures of life. If I could make a request it would be to add an additional squat rack up in the legs area. But I guess you'd have to find a place to put it. I was told about this website by Tobias who works at the gym. I think that is his name. The cool guy with the great hair. I want to also say that I am not the same Thomas F. that posted earlier.",positive
"This is a very nice gym indeed; never too crowded, friendly staff, and more than enough equipment at any time of the day. The only thing I will nip-pick on is that the facility is quite old. Other than that I love this place. Why do I love it? Here's why: I go here on the weekends during their busiest hours (4pm-8pm) and the place is barely full. Yes, it is more crowded than usual but it's NOTHING compared to the one on flamingo, or any other gyms (like LVACs) as a matter of fact. In my opinion, there is nothing worse than to wait around with three other guys just to use one machine. Also, their contract rocks. It's a no-strings-attached monthly deal. I guess the only time you feel gimped is in the beginning, because you need to pay a opening fee but that's merciful compared to the other greedy gyms. You can quit whenever you want because it's a monthly contract. I understand this facility is old but come on, it's not like the paint on the walls are peeling off. The equipments are a little aged but they work very well. I haven't had any issues with any of them malfunctioning. The water fountains have ice cold water and don't have any funny taste to them. The staff does a wonderful job of keeping the place tidy and they never fail to greet you by your NAME for a change. At LVAC I'll be surprised if they even say hello (by now you should know I hate LVAC). The staff will occasionally joke around with me and ask me how I'm doing. Very nice people. True to their name, the gym is 24-hours. If you happen to have the urge to pump iron at 3am in the morning, you know you can count on this place. LVAC says they have all 24-hour facilities, but their flamingo location actually closes early on the weekends, which was really upsetting. Maybe one day when I'm in a bad mood I'll review LVAC and dish out my first 1-star review. Enough digression; this 24-hour rocks and the only reason why I give them 4-stars is because they are in need of a renovation. However, it makes up for it in great service and a wide array of available equipments.",positive
"This is the ugly step-child of the 24 Hour Fitness Family. They are obviously ignored by corporate. Everything in the facility is old. Thankfully, the staff does very well with the limited resources. First the negatives: Locker room is small and locker size is even smaller. All the cardio equipment needs to be updated. Treadmill belts need to be tightened and decks need to be waxed. I had to try four TM's before I could find one that didn't slip. Positives: Although the strength training equipment is old, the staff does a very good job of maintaining it. The layout is functional and machines are arranged appropriately. Good group fitness instructors. This is one of the cleaner facilities in the 24 Hour Fitness family. Never really busy. The clientele is made up of people looking for a good workout, not a bunch of douche bags trying to show off or get a date. The staff should be congratulated for the outstanding job they do. Good job guys!",negative
People here are very helpful. Usually not too busy to get right on a machine. Classes here I hear are great but have yet to try one. I go there to just workout and leave. For this its great for me. No pool here is my issue but there are other 24 hours that have this.... but this is close to my house.,positive
"Very friendly staff, everything you could want to use to work out. No indoor track or pools, but that's available at the other nearby location for no additional charge. Being a student I love that 24 is everywhere. This means I can go when I visit my parents back home.",positive
"The facility itself is nice. Relatively clean and solid equipment. My serious qualm w this place is the general manager Martin. I usually don't blast people on yelp, but this guy is truly an idiot who is in dire need of professional training. Every time I've had a question of concern, the nice little girl at the front desk refers me to this joke and he usually speaks w a disparaging tone and never really has any solutions. He simples blabs about ""our gym policy"" and speaks from a place of frustration. 24 hour fitness needs to step up and fire this guy or properly train him.",negative
I love coming to this gym. Never crowded. Nice pool that offers lessons for kids. Sheldon and Riley are always very polite and helpful. Will definitely recommend this gym.,positive
"One star but I wish I could give zero. I agree with the other reviews about the gym being dirty, the staff being unprofessional, and the lack of customer service. Read EVERY word of each paper that you sign or email you receive regarding your membership because even if THEY are the ones that mess up, YOU are the one that pays (literally) and they do NOT give refunds. Do not waste your money on them. Bottom line they don't care about their customers. They only care about taking your money.",negative
"I use 24 hour fitness all over the nation, great value and great gym. A gym that has a sauna, Steam room, classes all day, as well as a good amount of weights and area to train. This is my favorite gym to use nationally now.",positive
I love this place !!! It really helps me to get to the next level on my personal fitness!!! The staff is amazing like Gloria!!!! Sometimes machines are not always working or a toilet is out of service but I understand it's hard to keep a big place going!! For that and many other reasons I feel that you deserve five stars!!!,positive
"24 hour.fitness crossed my account information with another member. Intern, suspended my account because the other member cancelled their membership. I first noticed they had not taken out my dues from my bank account. I brought this to their attention immediately, they verified my credit card on file and said everything is fine. I noticed again they had not taken out my dues, and brought it to their attention once again. They verified my credit card and told me everything was good to go. After being stopped at the front counter check-in and embarrassingly told my account is suspended due to non-payment Kama I called their corporate office. Once again they laid blame on me, and said my account had been suspended due to non-payment. I have been a member since 2008 and have had the same credit card on file for many of those years. This is the first time that I've ever had a problem and it was due to their mistake. Remember, they crossed account information with another member. Which resulted in a non-payment for my membership because they were trying to take my monthly dues out of another member's bank account. In two days world you would think banking information credit card information and personal information would a huge concern and a organization is largest 24 Hour Fitness would take every security measure possible to ensure something like this would never happen?? I was told by the people at the front desk, that they would have the general manager Mitch, call me as soon as he got in at 10 a.m. . At 11:30 I finally wound up calling the gym myself because I had not heard from anyone. I was informed that Mitch was not there yet... And ask to speak to another manager. I spoke to another person by the name of Thomas. Thomas was very rude and short with me on the telephone. As I try to explain the whole story to him he kept interrupting me with, ""uh huh"" ""ya I know"" I finally had to ask him if he understood what I was telling him about the mistreatment and embarrassment that was caused at the front counter and how it was clearly their mistake entirely. He acted very unconcerned, and as if I were wasting his time and interrupting his day. I finally had to steer the conversation to an end because I felt myself quickly becoming more upset. His last statement to me was, "" ya I know you feel like we don't care about you, I apologize about that, I'll have Mitch call you"". Here it is the following day and still no phone call. For a gym that has constant broken equipment, and that equipment stays broken for weeks on end before it's fixed or replaced period for a gym that is a lot healthier then most of their gyms. And is usually in a disorderly mess as far as equipment and weights out of place all over the gym, missing weights and equipment, I have to question now why would anybody pay monthly dues to a place that really does not care about their members, and doesn't give their members what they're paying for, and only to be treated like you were a piece of trash.?",negative
"BEWARE! I signed a contract, worked out for a bit, everything was fine. But, got married and now i have zero time for a gym so I had to cancel. You cannot cancel online, you must call number and talk to them. I told them I have to cancel and they said no problem. Just pay early termination fee of over $200. I almost flipped out and asked why. I was told that my contract was actually financing the money for the membership and I had to repay that. UNBELIEVABLE, this is a gym membership not a car or a house! I am trying to work with my bank but not looking well. Terrible way to do business, terrible company. VERY rude phone support. Never again.",negative
"This business just took 50 dollars out of my account for an ""annual fee"". This was never explained to me and the manager even acknowledged this to me. My problem is this suprise fee came 5 or 6 months after I signed up. I feel this fee should have been waived for this year. When my contract with this gym is up I'm going to join Planet Fitness half the price and no contracts. Do yourself a favor find a gym where the fees aren't hidden",negative
"For having an onsite maintenance person there 5 days a week it seems a little strange to see so many ""temporarily out of order signs"" everywhere. 2 of the toilets in the woman's restroom are going on a month now. Equipment is going on over 13 months now. If you have no intentions of fixing things why not remove it. Don't expect to work out to music that's broken too going on 8 days now. Also expect to be treated like a child and have to check certain items out using your drivers license. The club manager is a joke the district manager doesn't return phone calls. Join another club.",negative
"I've been a serious gym goer for almost a decade now and I know what I like and what is important to me when it comes to fitness centers. I've been a member of plenty of different gyms across 2 different states. Golds, 24, LA fitness, EOS, Ballys.. the list goes on. This far and away is my favorite gym. The first and most important thing that I look at when choosing a gym is how busy it gets during peak hours. The second is the quality and variety of machines and weights. The third is the behavior of its staff and members. 24 hour fitness on Craig is exactly what I want in a gym. I won't comment on the group classes, the trainers, the pools or other amenities because frankly, I don't use them and don't plan on it in the future. This gym is hardly ever busy (which means equipment is hardly ever broken), most of the clientele that frequent this place are friendly and generally keep to themselves and and the weight and bench set up is ideal. I know that a busy gym is a profitable gym. I'd gladly pay double or even triple my membership fee ($29 a month) to keep the casual gym folk out. LVAC and EOS is where these chatter boxes belong. I don't want to wait 30 minutes to get in the squat rack because a female in brand new yoga pants is attempting to take the perfect picture of her ass and I don't want to wait for 30 minutes for a bench press because a group of teenage guys can't stop gawking at her. I'm a lifter. I don't come here to socialize. This gym is perfect.",positive
I enjoy this gym and it is close to my house. Equipment is a little outdated but that is fine with me. I enjoy their classes.,positive
"I've been a member for the past 5 years. Pros: What I care about most is the cardio group exercise classes, and the instructors are excellent. Hallelujah, they finally installed fans, so the level of exhaled CO2 in there is tolerable. If you catch a promotion, the price can be reasonable. The staff and fellow gym-goers are overall friendly and make it a good experience. Cons: As other reviewers mentioned, the decor is outdated, some of the machines need repair--oh, and watch out for the pool/hot tub. More often than not, it's some funky green color and smells like moldy dishrags. (Another reviewer here posted a pic of the pool... it's not the lighting, it's really that shade of green, yes.) Bottom line: Depending on what you want from a gym, it might work for you. Do the trial membership before signing a contract.",positive
Beware!!! If you sign a contract a 2yr contract. It does not end when you're contract is up. You have to call them to cancel or they will continue to charge you every month. It's not right for them to do renew the contract without your authorization. Beware!!!!,negative
"A very nice gym indeed. I was in town on business for the day and was early for my appointment so I decided to put in an impromptu workout at this gym. I found this to be a clean gym with fairly new equipment and maintained in good working order. I did not see any ""out of order"" sign on any equipment which is unusual because it seems something is always broken at home gym in San Berghetto.",positive
I walk in to the gym and the manager Christina greets me with a huge smile and a welcome to 24. I loved her enthusiasm and her customer service was excellent. I'm from out of town and she made me feel like I was at my home gym. Everyone was very curious as well.,positive
"This is my go-to location. Friendly staff (even more-so if you're a regular and they recognize you), clean facility and never crowded. I never have an issue getting right to the machine I want to use. Maintenance must be a priority as I rarely see ""out of service"" signs on any of the equipment",positive
"I give this one star because you have to give it something. Where do I begin... First, the cleanliness, or lack thereof. Not once do you see staff members walking around and wiping down/disinfecting the vacant machines. I was a member at another gym, and any machine that was not in use was frequently being sprayed and wiped clean with something like Simple Green. This location will have multiple people at the front desk, but in my opinion, it really doesn't take 5 people to watch you scan your finger for entry. Instead, some of those employees should be walking around disinfecting. I have seen multiple machines covered in sweat, paper towels on the floor, empty bottles left laying around, dust, and other wet stuff on the floors/machines that you wouldn't want to see or wonder what it is during your workouts. And should we talk about the bathrooms??????? That's another story in itself....what the bathrooms need is bleach. No scratch that...a wrecking ball and overhaul. I don't understand how anyone would take a shower in those stalls and come out clean...The bathrooms and locker room area are beyond filthy. I think the staff should walk around and spray down and wipe down machines that aren't in use with a strong disinfect HOURLY. It's a gym, and gyms can get gross and sweaty and this location can use all the help in the cleaning department it could get. There is a cleaning lady walking around and I've seen her mopping before with jet black water that smells like a dirty sponge, but how effective can that be????? And if the water is that black, that should send a clear message to management that it needs to be done more often. Secondly, I left my other gym and came here because I wanted the option to attend classes. I should have stayed where I was at. There's really not a lot of variety with the classes. I mean how many Zumba classes does one gym need???? If you are only interested in Zumba or body pump, then that's about as diverse as it gets. There are other classes, but they are not offered as much. The class calendar here also looks nothing like Golds Gym. If you want more choices in classes at varying times, then this is not the gym for you. With Las Vegas being a 24 hour city and this being a 24 hour gym, I just expect more in that department.....especially if you're paying almost $30.00 a month. Other that that, the equipment is fine...dirty, but it's effective and gets the job done. It's a decent size...not too big, not too small. I don't use the pool, steam room, or sauna so I can't comment on that. Because of how dirty it is, that deters me from trying. I usually want to get in and get out. I also try to avoid the restrooms...do that before you come here. Plus you have to walk through the locker area to get to those areas, and we don't want to traverse down that road again, right??? But I would expect the steam room/sauna/pool area to look like the rest of the gym...filthy. All the other reviews that discuss the lack or sanitation and cleanliness at this gym are RIGHT ON POINT. Don't ignore them if you feel more comfortable working out in a clean sanitized environment.",negative
"Every time my boyfriend and I visit North Las Vegas, I come to this 24. It is always clean, smells good, and never packed. You don't get weird guys checking you out, even if you're the only girl in there. It's big with the equipment well placed and easily accessible. I love the chill atmosphere in here. I wish they had a 24 like this in San Diego.",positive
"Not impressed with this location. The inside was dark, dingy, and in desperate need of an update. The locker room floor was wet (more than what's typical and not near the showers) and many of the lockers with built-in locks didn't work. The equipment was ok, though it took me a few tries to find a treadmill that didn't have broken parts. The cardio area (floor mats, stretching, exercise balls) was small and difficult not to run into people. Also, our membership was expiring soon and upon checking in, got a sales pitch about signing up again and had to talk to staff to get our check in approved. There were male staff cleaning the women's locker room so I had to hurry to get my stuff and change before the cleaning. Is it not possible to find female staff for the ladies locker room? I've been to some lovely 24 hour fitness locations, but this one could use some help. Though the reason for not renewing my membership is primarily because the town we currently live in does not have a 24 hour fitness location, I think I'll stick with Gold's in the future.",negative
"LADIES DO NOT GO LATE NiGHT!! The man who cleans at night can't seem to stay out of the women's locker room. In the past three weeks, I have found him in there TWICE before the posted time the sign says a man will be cleaning (1am - I saw him at 12:30am one time and 12:20am another) and FIVE times after the posted time (which used to be 2:00am and is now 3am). I even left a note at the front desk for club management when he was in there at 3:40am (before the time was changed from 2am) which made no difference. Tonight he was again in there after 3am and was upset at me for complaining about it to the front desk person. It's the same man each time who keeps being there. How ridiculous!! By the way, I've seen him actually clashing in there once - all the other six times he was staring at himself in the mirror. Very creepy!!!",negative
"It's a gym that gets the job done. Cleanliness - Varies. Generally, it's clean, but during peak hours I've noticed trash and forgotten personal items lying around on the ground near some of the machines. As for the women's restroom/locker room, it's never been filthy whenever I've gone there. Machines - They're older than the ones I work out on at my main gym, but they're still functioning well. The one major concern I have is with the proximity of the weight machines. Some machines are too close to one another. I actually bumped my head on one while bending down to pick up something. Classes - The Group X classes here are great and they're the primary reason why I come to this gym on occasion. However, there are two reasons I sometimes avoid coming here for classes. 1. The workout room is smaller than other 24 Hour fitness locations I've been to. Try going here at peak hours for a Zumba class that has 50+ people packed in that space. There's hardly any room to move, and the place becomes unbearably stuffy. 2. I've always noticed men standing below the classroom to watch the women workout. Talk about unsettling. Staff - Perhaps one of the friendliest and most helpful I've encountered thus far out of the 24 Hour Fitness gyms I've visited. Other - If you come here during the evening, note that the parking lot isn't well-lit. I suggest parking as close as possible to the gym considering that its location isn't exactly in a safe part of town. Overall - This place isn't perfect, but like I said, it does get the job done if you need to workout and head out.",negative
"This 24 Hour Fitness has everything I need in a gym. I've seen bigger and newer 24 HFs, but this one has a great energy to it. They have tons of machines, so there's rarely a wait to get on anything you need. I often use the pool/steam room/sauna facilities, and I have had no problems there. Some have said here that the locker rooms are not clean, but I think they are fine. I see cleaners circulating around the facilities nearly every time I am working out. I don't love going to classes in general, but the ones that I have gone to here are really fun. I've done the Zumba and Body Pump. Every teacher I had was friendly and energetic, and really made an effort to learn people's names. My best experience here was with personal training. I tried several trainers out, but ultimately found a good fit for me with Brenda. She is very knowledgeable and created some really good workouts for me. Before I had her, I had a trainer that left suddenly. Management practically bent over backwards to make sure I was happy with my new trainer. They are also always having promotions for personal training prices so if you are interested in this, keep your eyes open around the gym for fliers with details.",positive
"This is the Closest Club to my house that has a Steam Room, Sauna, Whirlpool and an Indoor Swimming Pool - all unisex. Perfect ! I thought. The front desk was uninterested when I gave my Guest Pass, Next the Locker area was Spartan but adequate, Bring Your Own Towels, The shower was in need of Bleach as was the Steam Room. The Steam Room was filled with wet Paper Towels, Empty Plastic Bottles and a Funky Smell. The Sauna was under Repair, however it was working the next day, but it was being used by Members as a Lounge Retreat and they made it obvious no one was welcome to interrupt their environment by continuing to lay all over the benches. The Whirlpool was at 102 degrees - far too cool to get any benefit. I did not use the pool, however it looked fine, except for the member complaining how dirty it was the day before. The Gym equipment was being wiped down by No One - Members Nor Staff. There was no individual TV access at any of the equipment - Just Rafter Mounted TVs where you needed a Radio to Tune in to the Small TVs. The Floor in the Class Area was being replaced due to roof leakage and all classes were cancelled for the week - since they have No Secondary space. I found the $ 33.00 per month charge out of line for the qualiy of this gym. If this place were Clean and Updated and they enforced a Few Courtesy Rules on it's members It would Be Perfect - Until then It's just a Mess!",negative
"This gym tends to get below average reviews due to its size, cleanliness, and volume of equipment. Having said that, this may be most people's worst gym. However, this gym is actually my favorite. I'm here about 4 days a week, sometimes twice a day. This gym is full of regulars. Like Cheers, where everyone knows your name. I don't have a problem with the staff. In fact, they are like an extended family for me. I'm always greeted by name when I enter and leave. And no, they are not cheating by reading the computer screen. Usually greeted before I sign in. Feels like home here. When I walk in, usually get the hellos and nods from the other regulars. What I like most about this gym is that people are here to workout. Get in, get out. I do avoid this gym on Monday and Tuesday nights due to how crowded it can get. And, it's only crowded, because it's small. The rest rooms are filthy, but I don't use them anyway. Overall, gave this gym 4 stars because I'm able to get the type of workout I search for. People here tend to respect your workout and save their chatter with you once you're done.",positive
"I currently go to LVAC but my dad goes to 24 hour fitness. When he came to town he wanted to take me to one. So we went to this one and were sad we did. First strike: They refused to let me as a guest try the gym without paying. Seriously ten dollars. Weird because I thought every gym had a 7 day pass to try the gym. Nope. Second strike: He told my dad he needed to sign the parent/guardian portion of my guest paper. I was like I'm 28 and the reception guy said oh you look really young. Seriously I don't look like I'm 16. He was also very rude about it. I wanted to say ""dude not only do I get paid a whole lot more than you but I have my flippin masters so suck it"". Third strike: I was trying to figure out out to watch the TV since there wasn't a plug in on my machine. Tried to find another employee to ask but no one was around. Of 3 of there TVs were out anyway. OH and no FANS!!!!! My advice go to LVAC this place was so unfriendly.",negative
"I recently cancelled my 24 hr gym membership after 5 years and 3 cities. This was the gym closest to my house that I actually tried to avoid and would drive to the one on Ann rd an extra 5 miles just because this one was so bad. This 24 Hr is really outdated with old equipment, only 4 channels on itty bitty TV's to watch and it is fairly dirty. The big thing they needed to figure out was more gym cleaning stuff and not let it run out all the time. How hard is it to refill a paper towel dispenser. I have been in probably 15 different 24 hr fitnesses on the west coast and this is probably in the bottom 3.",negative
"First time I've been to this gym. This is actually really close to where I'm staying during my trip out to Vegas. Convenience. I like that. My buddy and I parked and headed toward the front entrance. Sliding doors open to reveal a good sized gym. Let the buffness begin! Environment: The gym is decent sized. It probably looked bigger because there weren't too many people working out (around 30 total). The equipment is spaced out with machines that isolate muscles appropriately grouped in the same area. Music plays in the background but it's not loud enough to actually enjoy (especially when the guy next to you is throwing weights around) or motivating enough to get you to work harder. The ceilings are high meaning that there's inadequate ventilation. In other words, you get to smell the sweaty guy next to you in all his/her glory. Wonderful. Trainers: I didn't actually see one trainer walking around the gym. The only employers were the two at the front desk and the people fixing machines. The two ""trainers"" at the front aren't really role models for those trying to lose weight. I'm sorry for having to compare this gym to my home gym in AH but our trainers would run circles around the ones here. Machines: This was the highlight of the entire facility. THEY ACTUALLY FIX THEIR EQUIPMENT IN A TIMELY FASHION!!! Gym members: I don't profess to be of admirable physique. But, being an athlete for more than three quarters of my life (and having a few body building friends) I know a thing or two about lifting. The guys here, first of all, are much smaller than those back at my gym from home. Secondly, the ""big"" guys here don't work put there legs. I think the accepted term is ""chicken"" legs. Third, the ""big"" guys tend to stand around and talk a lot. Recommendation: I'm always a big supporter of being healthy. Please go to a gym or be self motivated to keep healthy.",negative
"As a recent resident of North Las Vegas, I was happy to find a 24 hour fitness within driving distance from my house. I was not expecting ""the best"" of conditions because some 24 hour fitness locations can be a total let-down. However, when I walked into this 24 I was impressed. Yeah, I've seen better, but usually when they are better they are also packed and you have to wait for machines. I've never had an issue with anything that I want to use being taken. There are so many options and the place is nice and open. The bathroom/locker room area wasn't uncleanly when I was there and I've never had trouble finding a locker either. The only thing I would change is the size of the TVs in the cardio area. I have great vision, but even so, if I am 2 rows away from the TV I can't see the score of the game because it's too small. Otherwise, the staff is friendly, the place is clean, and you have options. I approve!",positive
"What good is ""24 Hour Fitness Free 7-Day Pass"" when they won't honor it... 24 Hr Fitness is nationwide, being a local or not should not make a difference when the rates are the same and there are locations available near the following person's address? I work out here often, the staff are friendly, the facilities are adequate, however I had a friend come as a guest. She called in advance to see if she would be eligible under my guest pass, which I did not have on hand, the person on the phone said shouldn't be a problem, they would take care of her. When we got there, the manager, name starting with ""V"" (not sure if I can mention people's names on here), said that she couldn't work out under my guest pass because she was not local, she explained to him that the person on the phone said it was fine & he told her that she was lying because there was no record of the phone call on their hand written phone log. She asked him if he would make an exception since we had made a long trip to the gym & we were told that it would be ok & she also told him how she too was a personal trainer for Bally's.. He started to get very snarky & condescending & told her there was a reason why Bally's was down the hole. So I stepped in to tell him that there was no need for him to be rude & that his attitude was poor and condescending. I asked him if there was a day fee we could just pay so we could go work out together, he told me the price in which case I handed him the cash which he took. My friend asked for the paperwork she filled out back because she didn't feel that they needed her personal info since they would not allow her to use my guest pass, & he wouldn't give it back, so she grabbed it herself. He told her he was going to call the cops & she couldn't work out. And he reluctantly gave back my money. He should not be a manager if he can't be nice & professional, instead he was rude & defensive & out right unacceptable behavior. Even his staff member apologized to us when he walked off.",negative
"When you're away from the Strip and need to get some exercise, there is not much around. Luckily, you can sometimes just run into a 24 Hour Fitness like I did. I first tried to go to what appeared to be a location right off the 95 fwy near Ann, but it had not been constructed yet. I drove around and found this location on Craig and it must have been an Active. I did not see any indication of its grade. There was no pool meaning it's probably not a Sport. If it was an Active, it was a large Active with several free weight benches, treadmills, bikes, and workout stations. There was nothing appealing about this place,. The interior was not run down but somehow the location was just not appealing and seemed obscure and hidden and made you want to leave as soon as you've finished working out. 2.5 stars.",negative
Out of town looking for a gym. I'm glad I found this place. They have everything you can think of. Very clean facility. Its not a place where everyone sits around on there phones. I will always come back when I'm in town.,positive
"Background of my review: * I'm a morning weight-training individual * I go to the gym 4 times a week * I've been going to this gym since March 2018 Gym has what I want: just the right amount of free-weight equipment, relatively cool environment, a weight scale. Things I really like: + Two places where I can do barbell squats + Three places (inclusive of the above) where I can do barbell deadlifts I mention the above since those are usually the places that I would experience ""traffic"", but again, I'm a morning person. One down side (which isn't enough to downgrade my rating) was an off-weekend during Memorial Day when they had limited hours due to carpet cleaning. It wasn't published early enough, so basically I went to the gym in a Saturday when they were already closed.",positive
This gym is amazing. It is inexpensive and has all the weights and cardio equipment any serious athlete will need. There are even punching bags! This gym is also quite empty which is great since there is no waiting to use certain equipments. We went on a Sunday and there was only less than 6 people in the entire place. Lexi at the front desk was incredibly helpful too. She was very friendly and addressed all our needs.,positive
I was very impressed with this facility. It is easily the best gym I've belonged to. Going from a big name gym where you feel like all they want is your membership to here is a big difference. The atmosphere is great and the owner is a wonderful person. I moved recently so I had to stop going here but I am going to miss it greatly. This is the best place I've ever worked out. Keep up the good work!,positive
This gym is awesome. Everyone (especially Matt the owner) is so friendly and helpful. I would recommend this gym to anyone.,positive
"I've been going here for about 2-3 months now and I love it! It's never super busy, everything is clean, great selection of cardio and weight lifting machines. Plenty of space to lift without feeling cramped. The employees are all super awesome. Matt is great and always in a helpful and positive mood. It's also an inexpensive gym compared to your typical LA Fitness or Anytime Fitness. You can definitely hire a personal trainer if preferred, though I haven't. Highly recommend this place!",positive
"This gym is amazing! They have all the right equipment, trainers and classes to allow you to become the best you can be. The owner truly understands what it takes to create a friendly neighborhood gym where people feel welcome and appreciated. The monthly membership fees are extremely affordable. The gym hours are also amenable to just about anyone's schedule. If you are in need of a personal trainer, massage therapist, physical therapist, nutritionist, or just about anyone involved in the creation of a more improved version of yourself, he is the guy to point you in the right direction by referring you to one of his many fitness specialists. I highly recommend this gym to anyone who is tired of the over priced, overly busy, chain gyms. Fantastic Gym. A much appreciated addition to the community.",positive
"Love this gym! Friendliest folks (everyone who works here is warm and welcoming, everyone who works out here is friendly) and the place is incredibly clean!",positive
"It's always immaculately clean, has a great equipment selection, is rarely over-crowded, and has an awesome owner! Matt is the best, and always greets you with a smile! Feels homey. Also love that there are no contracts involved, and you can cancel your membership at anytime (not as if I ever will). Totally worth the $20/month.",positive
My name is Marc and I recently joined this gym I am also a member of Planet Youfit EOS Mountainside Why so many gyms because their all missing something but here at 7th St they got it all for just 20 bucks a month with no down no yearly just 20 bucks a month So if your cheap like me but you also want an amazing gym to get yourself where you want it to be then this the place .....,positive
"Let's start by laying out the facts! 90% of gyms are based on either selling you memberships or enticing you to come in based on low cost memberships. Not this gym!! It's a simple 19.95 a month with no contracts or down payment! They have wifi and a great app that allows you to engage with your gym! At 7th street Gym, the first thing that will hit you is Value!! The equipment, the energy, the entire staff, the ambience and lastly the genuine smile a greeting you will get when you frost walk in from Matt Sloan! Not to mention the Amazing cloud plastered floors! 7th street gym Truly has it all!! Tanning, better health shots, versa spa systems, red light treatment, Zumba, yoga, wake up with Jake classes, cryotherapy,personal nutrition and training by Jake Elston, amazing equipment and the entire amazing staff of trainers. Tia-Chase-Chris-Juan--don-Andrew-Jake-Josiah and Kim! I truly look forward to hitting 7th street gym everyday and I promise you will too!!",positive
Visiting from out of town and this gym blew me away! More than enough equipment for any serious body builder and awesome staff! Will be back and highly recommend!,positive
Great workout and staff!! Craig remembers every name and is an expert at customizing the work outs to your personal activity level and athletic abilities. No two work outs are the same and I love that I can monitor my heart rate- I burn as many calories in 30mins at 9round as I do in 60mins at other popular work out studios! 9round is a very high-energy workout that is flexible (no appointment needed!) and fun! I would highly recommend this 9round studio!!,positive
"I've been part of many gyms but never have stuck with them (CrossFit, Y, Barre)- 9ROUND is the only gym routine I have been doing consistently for years. It's fun, fast, and varies every single day- you won't be bored! I really love Craig and the trainers here. Craig is probably one of the most positive guys I have ever met- he will remember your name next time you come. I go in the mornings and have gone at lunch and never had an issue getting in a round to exercise. Try it out!! First time is free!! (If you're nervous about coming in try going in late morning through lunch- it's not so busy).",positive
"I am not a current member of 9 Round but I go sporadically through ClassPass. After one visit to 9 Round, Craig knew my name and even remembered some of my strengths and weaknesses. This 9 Round is absolutely incredible. Passion is the first word that comes to mind when I think of this location and Craig. He is an amazing trainer and quite possibly one of the most encouraging trainers I have had. He takes the time to explain form and technique, something that I have found to be very rare. I feel lifted up and empowered after a class. The setup is just like every 9 Round....9 rounds for 3 minutes each. I love the concept behind being able to come and workout at whatever time works for you. If my current workout regimen changes and I need to start working out closer to home, I won't hesitate to become a member here. Excellent facility, excellent workout, incredible instructor.",positive
"This is a GREAT gym!! The workouts are so fun and the time flies by. Craig, the owner/trainer, knows everyone's name and makes everyone feel welcome! The first class is free, so you can try it before you buy a membership. Definitely recommend!!",positive
"Awesome trainer/owner that ensures that you are doing the exercises correct. Clean space, great workout! Highly recommend.",positive
"I can't say enough good things about this gym. The workouts are extremely challenging, but very doable. Everyday the workout is different, so I never felt bored. If you are looking to lose weight, give their 6 week fitness challenge a try. The trainers will work with you on meal planning and support through the challenge in addition to working with you in the gym. In my challenge, I lost over 30 lbs. the results are real. This gym can get it done- 30 minutes at a time!",positive
"I hate working out (I mean HATE it) but I love 9Round! The trainers keep me motivated and the 3 minute rounds make it easier to make it through. Every time I think I'm not going to make it through the round, the 30 second warning beeps and I know I can push myself harder for just that much longer. The heart rate monitors are awesome and help me motivate myself to push and burn more calories (it sends you a workout summary after every visit). I haven't stuck with working out this long in my entire life and I don't plan on quitting anytime soon! This is what I've been looking for. Thanks 9Round!!",positive
"A few months ago, I accepted the 9Rounds 6 Week Fitness Challenge @ 9 Rounds University. After 20 years of taking care of my athletes, students, my son, etc., I finally needed to take care of ME. As a former professional baseball player, I am no stranger to weightlifting, cardio and overall fitness. The years took their toll, however, and I found myself looking in the mirror at a person I wasn't proud to see. I accepted the challenge with trepidation, wondering if 25 lbs was actually attainable in such a short period of time.....but I went ALL IN and did everything full throttle. As a result, not only did I complete the challenge....but I won it in ONE MONTH! I lost 25.4 lbs in just 30 days! At the end of the challenge, I had conquered the challenge and lost 34.4 lbs....and that is only the beginning of my journey. I have lost another few pounds since and intend to double that total in the near future, returning to the healthy man I used to be. Simply put, 9Rounds University changed my life...and probably helped SAVE it long-term. I can't thank Wendy (my personal coach in this journey), Maria, Sarah and all the trainers for their support and encouragement. Don't waste another second at a gym where you try to figure out what to do.....9Rounds is a gamechanger. I am becoming a full-time member now that the challenge is over and can't imagine anywhere I'd rather be. Join the 9Rounds family......I guarantee you won't regret it!",positive
I did not have a good experience at 9round-university. I gave it one star for the location which is very convenient to my house. If you decide to give them a try do not give them your credit card. They will try to scam you by saying since you are utilizing the facility and our equipment we have to hold on to your credit card for collateral which is b.s. They ran my card a couple of weeks after I gave them a test run for a week and they decided to charge my card after telling them I'm not interested. Who does that?? What made me change my mind also was there was only one person overseeing the whole gym and he didn't care 2 squats about my safety. Being a first timer exposed to a punching bag and other equipment I could of done some damage to myself. He did not wrap my hands before I put on the gloves. Really!! Do yourself a favor and consider another fitness facility.,negative
"Let's be clear...I despise working out as much as I despise dieting but I love going to 9Round (I like leaving there even more...LOL!). I love that the trainers know my name when I walk in. The trainers are attentive without being overbearing, the workouts are really intense and because the workouts are only 30mins, I have no excuse to not go. I just renewed my membership at the location at Arbor Creek for the 3rd time this past weekend and I couldn't be happier. See you guys tomorrow!",positive
"The staff is amazing! They're always encouraging and upbeat. The music while working out is high energy too, which goes perfectly with the intense, but fun workout. Love it here!",positive
I LOVE 9round!! I've been a member since November of 2013 and can't think of a better place for a busy person to go and get addicted to working out. The trainers have become like family and you feel welcomed when you come inside. Not like a big box gym where no one even knows your name. You're motivated to push yourself every workout. The events that the owners host for members throughout the year set this gym apart from ANY other gym community that's out there!,positive
"9Round in the University area was a great place, and the first that I miss (having moved from the area). My coworker and I started going to support each other, then we both had to stop going secondary to doctors ""suggestions"". The owner was very nice, but a trainer by the name of CJ stands out because he was always helpful, attentive, and knew I was trying to hide when it was time to run around the building. He was a big encouragement, and the rest of the staff were nice as well.",positive
"I initially didn't go much when I signed my contract because I felt uncomfortable putting my gloves and wraps on.. The coaches didn't have time to really spend time with me one on one since they were busy coaching everyone else. I signed a 9month contract and have been out of town a lot due to a new job. So now I have to pay month to month until I can physically go in to give a 30day notice since my contract is up now. However, I'm out of town and they won't let me just call in to do it. Wendy wasn't very pleasant and not very concerned with my situation. I'm paying month to month for nothing. Try out another gym. I enjoy Crossfit since there's no contracts, coaches spend one on one time with you, and the community is extremely close. Plus, workouts are awesome! Basically 9rounds plus more.. Just remember customer service is everything. If a gym doesn't care about me personally, then I'll go elsewhere. Although the workouts are good, I would rather workout where I feel like people care and where I'm comfortable.",negative
This place will definitely whip just about anyone into shape! I've been a member since they opened back in April 2013. The owners and trainers truly give me the individual attention I need in a group setting so it really feels like I have my own set of personal trainers. Keep up the great work 9Round!,positive
"I'm usually here at this location for one of my kids sporting events but overall the facility is great in terms of coming to workout using the Nautilus equipment or even if you're planning to come to the pool as this is one of the few locations in the valley where the pool is open year-round. The staff always has information on hand to let you know about upcoming events and the two young adult areas are a great place and location for the kids to play. If you're an all-Valley member of the YMCA or just specific to one location, this is a great place to come as the basketball gym facility is also great and has plenty of seating to allow for parents and other family members to watch the game. Be careful of the parking lot and follow the signs as the traffic flow route & parking is odd & takes you towards the front and then around. With people trying to get in or out, it's a little bit confusing when I come through. Class schedule activities are always good as people try to stay as active as possible. If you live out in the Foothhills and are looking for a gym facility like with quality equipment, this one is definitely a recommendation as it supports the valley youth with positive programs.",positive
The child care program at the YMCA is a terrible place for your children. My child was bullied when he was supposed to be uplifted. When I approached the staff they did nothing. The chain of command is terrible as well. They do no investigations on allegations that occur at their facility they go off the word of a teacher. So if they were dishonest and your child is telling the truth it is impossible to get them to admit fault. Do not trust this facility with your children and if you already have you need to pull them before they get hurt and you will be the one to pay because of the membership waiver you signed. Please hear my warning when I say the YMCA in foothills is an untrustworthy place.,negative
"After getting in 4 times before as a guest, I had to pay $10 to get a guest pass. The woman who helped me was very rude, after this experience I might as well move to Lifetime.",negative
"I'm giving 5 stars to two great employees: 1. Olivia 2. Julyen I have not always had great service in the 3 years I have been a member here, but in the last year there have been some improvements in service, particularly from 2 great front desk personalities. Olivia and Julyen have made an effort to know and greet me and my family, they smile, and they wish us a good day as we exit the facility. This may seem like a small thing, but in a world with so few caring, considerate people, it really brightens my day. The facility can still do so much more to promote proper etiquette and availability in the free weight section of the gym, but the child care and front desk are so much improved. Thanks!",positive
"Their Aquatics Director Blake is AMAZING! She cares so much about he kids, is a FANTASTIC coach and the lifeguards are so professional.",positive
"I'm about to terminate memebership. I only joined because of the location. Very inefficient use of real estate. Lack of free weights and nowhere for deadlifts. Yet, there's a ""circuit training"" room in the back no one uses. Room in gym area converted into an office for director who I never see. Members lack etiquette, and desk and management are unresponsive to complaints for fear of confronting entitled soccer moms and other similarly clueless clientele. I'm clearly not the demographic they want to serve and feel like a second class citizen here. The Lincoln downtown ymca is outstanding and I'll miss it. Terminating soon because this ymca is awful.",negative
"I don't have a lot of experience with gyms, so take that into consideration when reading this review. My wife has been attending this gym for about a year now and loves it. Her favorite perk is the kids care. They allow you 2 hours of supervised care for your kids while you do anything in the facility. Sometimes she just drops them off and works on her laptop in the lobby. She loves the classes like weight lifting, insanity, spin. I've only done the yoga class and for a rookie it was very easy to follow along though I did learn that I have zero flexibility. I typically spend time in the gym area with the machines. All the machines seem to be in excellent condition and everyone also seems courteous when using them. The Y draws a more mature crowd, so perhaps that helps. There are a few sanitizing wipe stations to clean the machine down after use. There are windows everywhere, ceiling to floor, so plenty of natural light. There are at least 25 treadmills and less ellipticals. These fill up by about 9:30-10. They are really nice ones that connect with TVs on wall in front that are all on different stations. The locker room is pretty plain. Just the bare necessities. Maybe I'm just a shampoo snob, but the shampoo feels more like gas station hand soap which means I have to start bringing my own. Minor inconvenience. The towels barely fit around my waist, so the could be bigger. They do have a swimsuit spinner that spins your suit almost dry. Other areas I haven't used: swimming pool, young adult reading/chill area. We get a discount through my wife's work which makes it very reasonable rate.",positive
"I'm a coach for the boys 1st and 2nd basketball team and I have to say that I'm happy to coach here and be apart of a wonderful program. I thank the YMCA for allowing me to coach for 2 years. I've had nothing but great experiences. If you're looking for a program to put your kids in whether it's basketball, swim, volleyball, etc. I recommend giving the YMCA a try.",positive
"Avoid this place if you're serious about fitness. The pool is great but the weight area is extremely small and always a mess. Weights are strung all over the machines/benches and certain habitual offenders never pick up after themselves. After a year of putting up with basically a coed curves, my wife and I are headed elsewhere along with our $84 a month member fees.",negative
I have been going to this YMCA for over 4 years and I am still as in love with it as I was on day 1. There are so many friendly employees and the classes are the best! The instructors are so amazing and no matter what your fitness level is they accommodate you and help you do your best.,positive
"Don't waste you fees here if you desire use of a gym. During the weekday prime hours 5pm-9pm weekdays and all day during weekends, it is booked for teams. It shouldn't label itself as Ahwatukee ""family YMCA"", more accurately, ""sports-team-exclusive YMCA""",negative
"For someone who just folds towels and scans membership cards, the lady with the curly hair sure was rude when I asked her where the bathroom was . Mind you this is my first time at a YMCA gym. She acted as if my 1 second question was keeping her too occupied to fold towels .",negative
"The facility is top notch! And the staff are all so nice!!! They are the reason I so enjoy going there everyday. And all of the group fitness instructors are extremely motivating and really sweet! And the child center staff are ALL amazing!! They light up when they see my daughter walk in. That makes it very easy for me to enjoy my workout. Like I said, every single person that works there are super friendly... The front desk staff, fitness instructors, child center staff, etc. The facility is always really clean too! And I never have to wait for a cardio machine.",positive
"My entire family are in and out of this building throughout the week. Staff is friendly and inviting. Ahwatukee is very lucky to have such a great facility at their disposal. A great place to work out, swim, climb a rock wall etc. the kids love it ! The wife loves it ! I love it ! Enough said.",positive
"I'm not your typical ""gym rat"" but this place is nice. It is always clean and never overly crowded. A bike, treadmill or elliptical can always be found even during the busy hours. There are not any juice heads hear grunting constantly so that's nice. It is amusing seeing the Ahwatukee house wives walking around with diamonds the size of eyeballs sometimes. The staff is always friendly and accomodating, Jill is the best though. She always has a smile on her face and can answer any questions that you have...she's awesome! Its not like Lifetime Fitness, but its not $100 a month either.",positive
"There are three main reasons I love this YMCA. 1.) It is super close to home. This alone gets me to the gym. 2.) It has AMAZING childcare staff. Ms. Erica and her team are so great with the kids. It is a program for up to age 7. My neighbors all belong to this gym because they know their kids are in good hands. They even have a once a month Parents' Night Out event for $20 that is from 5-9PM on a random Saturday. The kids get to watch a movie and have pizza. They also get to go into the gym and go wild throwing balls - they seem to LOVE this part. 3.) Their fitness classes are great and are included in the membership price. The only reason I am not giving the YMCA 5 stars is that they charge more for memberships based on zip codes. Just because I live in a historically more affluent zip code does not mean I want to pay nearly three times the amount to work out here. It makes me want to kick myself for not joining the Y when I lived downtown. It would have saved me about 65 bucks every month! Overall, I love this YMCA. I haven't checked out their really cool pool yet... but that's only because I am not in bathing suit shape! Give me a few months and MAYBE you will see me at the pool. :)",positive
"My husband and I have been members of the Ahwatukee Y for many years and this month we were charged an additional $20 with no notice of the increase or further information. I tried to get pricing on the internet for the valley Y's, but it is not available. So I called the general information number and was told the price increased to $75 in this demographic area. Each Y charges a different price and now you have to pay a premium to go to another Y in the valley (at least that is what I was told!). In the past we have supported the Y by donating to them through the Valley of the Sun United Way, etc. but I think this is unfair marketing tactics depending on who you talk to on the phone. One woman even said I had to belong to the one nearest my house even if I wanted to go to one near a place of employment! I called the Tempe Y and they said their price is $80 for two people, but my friends in Mesa pay $38. I think the Phoenix YMCA needs to simplify their marketing techniques and make it fair for those on fixed incomes, with no families, no need for the pools, no need for classes, rock wall etc. All we want to do is use the treadmill a couple times a week. I am ready to quit, but my husband wants to continue, so we will see.....",negative
"I think it had been about 36 years since I had set foot in a YMCA before I joined this branch last Summer. I didn't remember much about the last time other than tile--lots and lots of blue tile. Oh, and feeling like I was almost drowning. My early swimming experiences weren't pleasant. So, I was a bit dubious when my sister suggested I join and talked about the place as though it were a palace of some kind. Hell, it's a YMCA . . . you know . . . . ewww . . . Well, this location in Ahwatukee is not quite a palace, but as gyms go it's pretty damn close. Just working out today I noticed that although the construction materials are just about what you'd find in a warehouse, the design makes the main gym hall feel like human space. That must be hard to do with a gym since so many other designs get it wrong. A lot of thought and inspiration went into the architecture here, and it shows. The heated beach-entry pool has totally entranced my little 4-year-old, as has the active water sculpture-thing in the pool, which he can activate all by himself just by pushing a button. There are not only dressing rooms for each gender set up with direct access to the pool, but one set aside for families. That one also has its own access to the pool area. The machines are up-to-date and kept in good repair. This location uses the FixLinxx tracking system I've talked about elsewhere. There's a dedicated spinning room and a separate set of the simple ""grampy-style"" weight machines (at least that's what I call them). Help is friendly and plentiful, and in joining you get a fitness consultation that actually seems to be cluefull. The trainers and employees manage to treat people as adults and not as children or draft inductees. Both hand and bath towels are provided free of charge. The childcare area is palatial as well, with plenty of toys and places to climb. The hours of coverage are ample. The girls and women who watch the kids actually act as though they enjoy their work. And the atmosphere is a relief in that it's family- (and not douchebag- or creepazoid- ) centered. That's not to offend any douchebags or creepazoids out there. I'm sure there are places for you, too. In fact, I know there are. The crowd is neither very young nor very old, and no one seems to be intent upon laddering-up to the top of the gym social order. About the only drawback to this place is that there are no benches in the locker rooms. Oh, and it can also get quite crowded at prime times, though not as badly as the LA Fitness location I also use. It's definitely one of the better values in gyms in the area, and that's not even taking into account the opportunities for kid's sports and swim lessons, etc.",positive
"This review is specifically for Melanie's Zumba Class. The class is the most fun I have ever had working out. Women are shaking their butts, the classes are always full and everyone is having a great time. If Melanie ever leaves, I will cancel my membership!",positive
"If I could give negative stars, I would. The manager was a little rude when showing the facilities to my friend and me. He guaranteed us a 7 day trial period where we could cancel our membership if we chose not to continue with the membership. It has been 3 months since I cancelled and I am still being charged... I have called in to correct this and it hasn't changed. Any time I go into the facilities myself, the manager is not available at the time. I am a college student who is not looking to get $65 taken out of my account every month when I don't have a key fob or access to a gym that I am not using and am not interested in using. There are way better gyms around the Madison area. It's even worth the bus ride to go to planet fitness or the Nat instead of the small, overpriced, unfair excuse of a gym on East Campus Mall. Terrible.",negative
"The overall space is small and can get crowded especially during peak hours (which is expected, but definitely worse here). However it is convenient for folks who work on campus and accessible via its location. I'm not particularity fond of the staff. I've had two instances where both staff persons were rude and didn't seem interested to ask if I needed any help. I once asked a staff member about a pair of clothes I left in one of the restrooms and she responded rudely and in a snobby tone - that nothing had been dropped off to her that day. The customer service at this location is poor and don't seem to give a damn about anything that goes on in the facility. The bathrooms are pretty dirty and seems to only be cleaned every once in a while.",negative
"I have had trouble with my personal training contract and billing payments ever since I started. They constantly try to take money out of my account without giving me personal training sessions. It's annoying and frustrating to have to complain to them all the time about their horrible billing and money practices. Like the other user who complained, they make a lot of promises about fixing the problems they create, but they don't follow through. Run away from this gym - run like the wind!",negative
The location is convenient for students or anyone who works downtown. It's located on the campus mall with easy access to bike racks. I like being an Anytime Fitness member but this particular location can get pretty crowded and I wish there was more room between the lifting machines. The place is clean though and I feel safe leaving my purse in the cubby whole I work out.,negative
"This Gym is Extremely Tiny and because it is so tiny it is really difficult to get time on equipment. It's like working out in a overly crowded garage. (There are plenty of treadmills though) It is very expensive for such a small ill equipped gym. $39 a month plus a large set up fee with a ridiculous contract. This gym does not have enough equipment. In fact there are no traditional bench presses and they expect you to do bench from the squat rack. There are only three squat racks. It is terribly difficult to secure a squat rack. There are zero lockers. They have an honor system for your stuff to not be stolen which makes me uncomfortable. There is also no supplements for sale either. For $39 one would think Anytime Fitness would have bars, shakes and supplements to buy for workouts. Speaking of honor, these people have none. I told the manager Nick Hansen I move for business constantly and did not want to be locked in on the contract in case I move, which I probably would move. He promised and assured me it would not be an issue if I had a Drivers License with a different address. I told him I would give my old Arizona drivers license and use my Oregon Drivers License one if I needed to cancel. When I went in to cancel he lied and told me I needed a ""newly"" formed drivers license. It is quite frustrating to deal with unscrupulous persons lying and saying anything to get someone to sign up and then when the person tries to leave they lie again to try and get them to keep paying. Has anyone ever heard of karma? Heard of doing the right thing? If the management was not bad enough by itself, the tiny space with the minuscule variety of equipment to get in shape really sharpens the picture here- Worst Gym I Have Ever Encountered",negative
"So... just wondering... WHEN will this be rectified?? The doors are always left open, the music from the class clashes with the overhead music, and the instructor's 'whoops' and 'yelps' are incredibly distracting .... There's little to no respect for everyone else trying to focus and work-out. I'm trying to be patient, but nothing has been done about it after all this time.",positive
"I'm very happy with this gym. It's clean, and the staff is always friendly and ready to help. I work out with Travis, who is an amazing trainer. I've had really great results, and he's always positive and encouraging. Taylor, at the office, is always great too.",positive
"I'm not impressed, for many reasons. It's a chain corporate gym but I'm not holding that against them. It is always clean and well maintained. Overpriced Wifi never works Limited equipment Staff completely uninterested I'm a manager of a gym and a competitive bodybuilder and needed a gym close to home to supplement my cardio. I was excited when Anytime opened because it's just a few minutes from my house. I've been a member for several months and have recently cancelled. I have talked to staff members and management about these and other concerns to no response. Within a few minutes from my house, though not as convenient, is a LA fitness, Ufit, knockout fitness and maybe more if I look. So I'm going elsewhere. But if your looking for 24 hour access, willing to pay a lot for it, and are okay with limited equipment, then this is a gym for you.",negative
"This is a very nifty medium sized fitness center with an excellent variety of modern equipment (cardio, weight machines, etc.). The facilities are open to members 24/7 and the facilities are super clean. I have been to the Anytime Fitness facilities in Phoenix, Glendale, and Tucson. All of them are excellent and very pleasant to use. Well done Anytime Fitness.",positive
This gym is awesome it's really clean looks like all of the machines are brand-new and it's five times larger than the one I work out in Kentucky,positive
"I am convinced this gym has never been cleaned. I've been to many other anytime fitness locations and this seems like an entirely different gym and company. Dust and dirt everywhere, old sweat left on machines. I took my shoes off to do squats and had to throw my socks away because they were so black and dirty.",negative
Great gym! Feels like home. The people are friendly and the staff is very helpful. There's a good selection of equipment and is all in good shape.,positive
"This facility is great. The manager Camron is very professional, knowledgeable and friendly. He always greets with a warm smile. He does a great job of maintaining this facility. I highly recommend this gym!",positive
"I've been waiting until I had worked out here for a few months to write a review so I could get a long term perspective of it. In short, this is my least favorite location for Anytime Fitness. The gym doesn't appear to have been deep cleaned in years. The equipment is grimy and dusty with large piles of dirt underneath many machines. Bathroom space is minimal and continually gross, often running out of paper towels on weekends. I don't see many people wiping down equipment and it often stinks in here. I've even seen staff members use equipment and not wipe down. The TV situation has no excuse. Basic broadcast stations if you're lucky. No gym should be without ESPN. I use the place 3-4 times per week because it's close to my work. If this had been my first experience with the club, I'd have gone elsewhere. I've been coming here for a year now and I can't believe how disgusting this place is. In one of the restrooms there is crusted feces around the base of the toilet that has been there the entire time I've been using this gym. The equipment is still continually dirty with dust and hair and no one cleans at all on weekends. Regardless of cleaning schedule, whom ever is tasked with cleaning doesn't do a thorough job. I've Yelped, spoken with staff, and emailed Anytime corporate with zero effect. My conclusion is that the owners just don't care. Arcadia and central Scottsdale locations are spotless and worth the money. Chandler is in a word, foul.",negative
"Not sure why there are so many bad reviews, it looks like it may have a new owner now. The gym is fairly well equipped. There are actually 2 squat racks AND a smith machine. There is the wood and rubbery type flooring for one of the squat racks for doing deadlifts and such. The place is always super clea. There is a separate room for classes but its always empty when I'm there so its good for stretching and things like that, away from the main weight room. There are few cons--there is no vending machine for pre-workout drinks, ya know, in case you are in a jam and forgot yours or are just dragging that day. The other thing is that there is a lot of space--they definitely could fit more equipment in the future if they optimized the spacing.",positive
"I was rudely yelled at by the female trainer, as I was in the studio room with some friends (we are members of anytime) and we were doing posing for our fitness show. She said we couldn't be in there doing that,which I think she was upset that we were posing for another competition organization not npc, as she is part of npc. She had gotten into a big argument with me. We were only going to be there for 30 min and got kicked out before. Me or my friends will never come here again. She could have been a lot nicer and we would have left, but instead she was rude. Beware.",negative
"HORRIBLE place, I just wanted to get some info and was talked to so rudely by a woman who was ""teaching a class"" and basically told me to get out. Not a good start and A few of my friends say they went here for awhile and it's really slipped. I wouldn't waste your time or money here",negative
"This review is based on their collectors. They took over Fitness Forum (a longtime family owned joint). I cancelled my membership with Fitness Forum over a year ago. I didn't notice they were still charging me. When I called to ask them about it, they advised me to file a claim with my bank and apologized for the inconvenience. Fast forward to 3 months ago when I started receiving harassing phone calls from 800.897.6877 and letters saying I owe for a month's membership for Anytime Fitness, a gym I've never even stepped foot into. I cancelled Fitness Forum because I was doing a lot of travelling - now that I am in the market to join another gym I can safely say that Anytime Fitness will not be considered. What a bummer that such a friendly gym is now just another big box chain here in my hometown. :(",negative
"Probably one of the worst locations I've been to. I cancelled because this was the closest location to me and was hot, smelly and lacked free weights. The owner was also creepy and knew my name before he introduced himself. Not sure if he looked in the system or what but I don't like working out when I feel like I'm being watched.",negative
"Awesome staff! Love Erica. Jason is super. They are helping me stay on my triathlon training regimen while in Chandler, AZ for several weeks from Alabama. Love this place! I'll be back often to visit my new grand-daughter an this is where I'll continue my elite Masters Triathlon gym training.",positive
"This place rocks! The owner and staff were amazing, easy to work with, and helped my wife and I achieve our fitness goals with just the right support. They support and honor military families and the gym has everything you need for autosmoke..",positive
"Pro's Gym is clean Equipment is adequate and in good working order 24 hour access Con's The owner Jay Bru is a scum bag liar and I would avoid doing business with this man at all costs. I joined this gym on a month to month membership because I knew I was going to be moving out of the area in a few months and couldn't get locked into a long term contract. To have this luxury I was paying a pretty big premium of over 40.00 dollars a month in order to cancel at anytime. When the time came for me to cancel I called the gym and got Jay. I informed him I needed to cancel my membership and he asked me to call back when some female was working. He said he didn't know how to cancel it (He's the owner mind you) Ok fair enough I'll call back. I call back another day when he told me to, he answers again I ask for the other employee he says she's not there. I insist on canceling my membership with him instead of playing this game of continuing to call back. He says ok then he starts to tell me they don't do month to month memberships and he's going to charge me 150.00 dollars. I tell him no I am not paying 150.00 dollars to cancel my membership that I had been paying a premium each month for the right to cancel at anytime. Then he tells me he can't find my contract and I must belong to another location. We continue to go back and forth before he finally says he will cancel my membership. So after a week and multiple phone calls and half a dozen lies from Jay he finally cancelled my membership. After reading this If you are dumb enough to do business with this lying douchebag you better hang onto your copy of the contract.",negative
"Awesome staff, and I LOVE the gym mascot! Kass the Booty Pump instructor is so knowledgeable. Really makes sure that we're doing the correct form to minimize injury and makes it so fun while doing so. I'm not a member, however, the classes are $5 drop ins, SO worth it for the quality training you receive. Ab class and botty pump for the win! Thank you!!",positive
"Jay (owner) MAKES the experience in this gym! He is friendly without being pushy. Knowledgeable without being a know-it-all. Great guy to be around. Gym has 24 hour access which I love since I'm always working or with my kids during ""normal"" hours. I definitely recommend this place!",positive
"DO NOT GO THERE!!!! Giving a rating of one star is way too much for the horrible service you get there. I signed up few months ago and the trainer I was ""supposed""to meet up with was never available and the one time I ran into him at the gym he was too busy texting away not even engaged with the conversation. The ""owner"" Jay, by far the worst owner. His lack of customer service and knowledge of how to run his business is pathetic! I was charged multiple times for the membership after I had given my 30day notice to cancel and when I reached out to the owner for resolution on reimbursing my money he said he would call me back within an hour. 4 hours went by no call from the owner,when I called him back he was so rude,unprofessional and incompetent to resolve the matter. He tried to rush me off the phone and said he would call me back (yeah right!) Once I told him I was going to report him to the BBB he then said he will look into it and email me receipt. Still nothing. BBB got a nice report from me and couple other clients that used to go with me and are just as dissatisfied with their lame service. Bottom line this place is not worth it in a lot of different aspects. The owner clearly has no idea how to keep clients or even hire professional trainers. Dont go there unless u wanna be ignored and mess with your bank account!",negative
"I was a member of this gym for about a year and half and could not have been happier. Jay is a great manager and all of the equipment is well maintained. I travel a lot for work and have been to more than a dozen other anytimes across the country. IMO this is the best all around location (there's no place like home). Having moved to Scottsdale, this gym is too far of a drive now for me. Had I stayed in Chandler, I never would have left.",positive
Anytime fitness is awesome! I will recomend this place to my friends and family. the staff is friendly and the facility is nice and clean. A nice thing about this place is you never have to wait to use a machine. they also have the newest equipment. Thank you Stefan Bryan For recomending me to this place. Im glad I made the switch.,positive
"I am guilty of going to big box, cookie cutter, no one knows your name type of gyms. I have spent ungodly Amounts of money on personal trainers, monthly memberships, and home equipment. It's exhausting. After giving up on my""big box"" gym down the street because I was tired of donating to their profits, my friend told me to look into Anytime Fitness. I need the 24 hour gym because I tend to wake up early or go to bed late and dislike having to plan my schedule around a gym. So I sucked it up and decided to give another gym a chance. I am so happy I did. The manager, Stefan, was very welcoming and understanding of my ""gym-commitment hesitation."" He explained the different options I had, the different classes they offer, and so forth. I signed up that day and haven't looked back. I like the laid back atmosphere, and like the fact I don't have to deal with the annoying teeny boppers that I had to at other gyms. It's definitely a place people actually go to work out and not the ""tender"" version of a gym. Try it out... You won't be sorry!",positive
"Do not go here! It is not worth it! So I signed up for a free trial period, 14 days, I thought cool, I could try it out and see how it goes. Well it says that is open 24 hours, but I had to be there when it was staffed, strange right, because if you are 24 hours shouldn't you always be staffed?! But anyway so I went in the next day during the staffed hours, and met the owner, who had this god awful huge dog just running around, then he asks ""you don't like dogs?"" Hell no, I don't like dogs, I am looking for a gym not a damn Pet Smart! Anyway, I ask him about the free trial and he tells me that I must put down at $50 deposit for the key?! WTF?! So pretty much there is no ""free trial"" you must pay $50 and then if you don't like it, they will return it to you...bullsh#! So I left and went down to Planet Fitness and was so impressed with their facility and professionalism (i.e. no dogs) that I decided to just join and only had to pay $1.02 down and the monthly rate is only $19.99, they had a huge facility, and they are 24/7 no gimmicks, no lies! The membership at Anytime Fitness is damn near $40.00 for a 1 or 2 year contract. So I must say for God's sake go to Planet Fitness or anywhere else but here. There is not a lot of machines and the management is HORRIBLE!!!!",negative
"This gym has more equipment than any other Anytime Fitness that I've visited. I read a few of the other reviews and I have to say that I haven't had any issues with trainers attempting to sell me their services. I usually train at night and the trainer is there sometimes, but he has never bugged me or solicited at all. In addition, none of the guys have ever rushed me off equipment. The atmosphere is clean but it's too hot and crowded. The owner hasn't bothered to get the ac serviced. I don't like the location and the price ....plus the fees. It's a little high in my opinion but some of it has to do with the fact that it's 24 hours. And I have to say that I don't think it's fair that the owner is selling 3 month memberships on Groupon for $49 which means new members don't have to pay $25 for keys and they don't have to deal with contracts or extra fees which is total bs in my opinion! In addition, the a/c had been having issues the last three weeks. As a result, I haven't been working out as much at this location. It's beyond ridiculous for the amount of money that I pay each month!",negative
"We were one of the first to sign with Anytime in 2012 it was sold to Jay Bru in 2013. Since Jay has been the new owner of Anytime, the gym has improved 100 percent Great staff, people, equipment and just an enjoyable atmosphere. Thank You Jay for a nice neighborhood gym. Steve S P.S. it beats those $10.00 a month foo foo gyms.",positive
"I would not refer this gym to anyone. Trainers push you to sign up for their personal training sessions each time you go into the gym. Some people just want to go to the gym and not be hassled. Even with headphones in, you get tapped on the shoulder. If you don't sign up for your free one time training, calls constantly come in and they question you every time you go into the gym. The end all for me was when I asked for my dates to be changed for my payments. I was told it was no problem and taken care of. First month that my account was overdrawn, I was understanding and emailed Jay, the owner for confirmation on the date change. He offered free training session. I declined, just wanted to be refunded the 25$ overdraft fee or even apply it to my account for the next month. Jay declined. I tried to be understanding as mistakes can happen and I get that. Second time was the kicker for when the funds were taken out on the wrong date, it drained my account so I could not fulfill other financial obligations. When contacting the business owner, his response was offering free training sessions again and made it perfectly clear via email that he only wanted ""his business to grow."" Jay did not offer to refund the 25$ overdraft fees, did not offer to put it on as a credit to my account, just wanted me to take these classes/training sessions. After several attempts at just getting the overdraft credited to my account, I finally reported the business to the BBB. Clearly he does just want his business to grow and is not looking to help those who are inconvenienced by his financial mistakes. I think I will just go back to LA Fitness where they were honest, trustworthy, and did not have an environment where you had to avoid eye contact to make sure no one hunted you down to sign up for more services.",negative
"Great place great people, trainer Nathan is awesome. Selection of equipment is top notch. Go to place for fast and easy workout",positive
"This is my first gym membership ever! I had to hop on the bandwagon and I'm glad Anytime is my first. I had visited many gyms and Anytime was the only atmosphere I really enjoyed. It's not overwhelming and the moment you walk in someone is greeting you (well during office hours). There are rarely more than 5 people working out so machine availability is incredible. I'm a girl so I love my cardio! The machines offer cable/ internet/ and charge my iPhone :) The office staff is extremely nice and answer about any question possible. Jay is the best, he is always asking how my day is, if there is anything I need and if there is anything I would recommend for the gym. Once a week I see Jerid, the personal trainer at the gym and he is awesome. I've noticed such a difference in my body and strength, that guy really knows his stuff. Plus, on my days off if I want to use a new strength machine, he is willing to show me how it works and make sure I'm not killing myself. If you are looking for a real gym with no gimmicks, nice people and great machine availability this is your place! Plus its 24 hour with great parking what are you waiting for?!",positive
"Gosh I really dislike personal reviews, I'm more for the fun ones about how good this dish was or that hotel was plush! But to not write review just isn't me either. Haha For the past 2 years I have been on a weight lost journey, I'm 22 pounds away from saying I have lost 100 pounds in 2 years, doing this by watching what I eat, counting calories, and working out, no fad diets for me, and up until March I have been doing this either at the gym within my complex or would meet up with a friend at his gym in Phoenix. But after I moved in March I no longer had access to a gym and started looking at where I would like to go, there are so many choices people can pick but I went with Anytime Fitness, mainly picked them because it's Anytime! 24/7 and that right there works with my scheduled. So I called down and told them I am interested in joining the gym, the available times they had during the week were not great for me, so they made an appointment that works for me on a Sat morning. I got the gym Sat and I noticed on the door it said the office is closed on the weekends and when I met up with Jay, the owner, he said they are closed on the weekends but made this appointment for me so I can check them out! See I like that, this is a personable gym, Jay is amazing, and he is sweet and helpful and Jarod who is also amazing, is there is help out with any questions and if need personal training you should hit him up and it's not bad pricing either! This gym is new, it's very clean, and has everything you can think of, and of course the hours are whenever you need them to be. With my crazy schedule my hours are late in the evening, and I feel very safe being there, the parking lot is right outside the door, no one can come in unless they have the key, the doors are locked at all times and there are cameras everywhere. If you're not into a gym that actually cares how you're doing, what your goals are, and offer tips on how to get there, then this isn't the place for you. But if you like the personal touch, then go see Jay! I'm happy I did!",positive
"We emailed our previous gym a list of questions the owner/front desk unable to answer/never responded. I sent the same list of questions to the owner of Sunrays and he responded in less than 24 hours with the appropriate answers. Here are the questions- 1. What are the facility's safety policies and procedures? Are there regular safety and maintenance checks of the equipment? 2. How long has Oasis been in operation? 3. How often is the facility cleaned? Is the equipment ever cleaned? 4. What sort of insurance coverage does membership include, and what fees are necessary for full coverage? If any injury occurs does the facility guarantee full treatment, both upon occurrence and through rehabilitation? 5. Do the team coaches have Gymnastics coaching certificates? 6. Are the coaches trained in first aid and CPR? 7. How many years of coaching experience do the coaches have? In particular, experience coaching children. 8. Are lesson plans available? All of the coaches introduced themselves. I know their first and last names and their experience. After each class they say goodbye and tell you had your daughter did. Everyone is friendly, responds to emails, phone calls in a timely manner. Welcoming and really enjoy their jobs. I have two daughters enrolled in their classes and both really enjoy it and have had major improvements. The facility is cleaned 7 days a week. Looks clean and smells clean!",positive
"I called on Friday about the new Arcadia location and spoke with the front desk who told me they didn't have any classes at that location on Friday. She informed me about the rest of the schedule and that they had an open gym there on Sundays from 11 to 12. So I planned my Sunday around taking my daughter there, only to get there and it's closed. So I call again and the front desk (it must automatically transfer to the other location) is confused why no one is there, ensuring me someone should be there. She takes my number and says she will call the director and get right back to me. A few minutes later, someone (the director maybe) calls me back and says that place isn't open today. They in fact don't even have any open gym days. It's now 11:15 and she tells me I can come up to the main location and pay for open gym there until noon. Ummm my timing might be off, but driving to there other location at this point would give me about 10 minutes of gym time for my daughter. And when I mention this to the women she gets pretty rude. I get it. Your staff screwed up, but at least be apologetic. Not once did she say sorry for the mix up or take any blame. Considering I was about to drop like $100 on toddler classes a month here, I'm glad I found out how this place treats people first. I'll spend my money elsewhere.",negative
"We had my son's 3rd Bday party here yesterday and it went so much better than I imagined it. The party went smooth, without a glitch. The party host took care of everything, they were great with the kids and the planned activities and were so friendly and pleasant. We had several different ages and they had something for everyone and they all thoroughly enjoyed it! Our guests all complimented us on the party. I highly recommend having a party here!",positive
"I would give them ten stars if I could!! We are not members of the gym, but stumbled across the Sunrays while researching options for our daughter's 4th birthday. From start to finish, the experience was nothing short of spectacular. Erin helped with our booking and made it incredibly easy right from the beginning by answering all of my questions in great detail. Amber and Maria were our party hostesses and the kids had an absolute blast with them. They were friendly, helpful and super efficient in the setup and tear down of the party, clearly pros at what they do. I would absolutely recommend this space for a kids party (heck, I'd have a grown up party there!).",positive
"My 3 yr old has been enrolled for little over a month now. Started with just a month to see how my daughter took to it, and was enrolled long term by the 3rd or 4th class! Even in that short period of time I've seen incredible progress. Daughter LOVES IT! Staff and all the instructors have been nothing short of top notch! Highly recommend!!",positive
"My daughter has been here 2 years+ and we have nothing but good things to say about the teachers. They are talented and really get involved with all the students. When you deal with teenage girls there are challenges to overcome that transcend the dancing. These instructors realize that. The pricing tends to change as they rearrange the format yearly, but the changes have been all for the better so far as I have seen. The one thing I wish they did is compete, but that doesn't seem to bother my daughter at all, so it's all good. They do perform a sufficient amount, at the State Fair, Glendale Glitters festival, Desert Ridge, and other places. The recitals are fantastic! There are other schools that do compete, but we are very happy here.",positive
"This is a great gymnastics school for serious gymnasts. My daughter has been going here for a year and a half and she has shown considerable improvement, is getting stronger, building confidence and it's helping improve her coordination. They change the circuits every two weeks so the routines are always fresh. I love the teacher Jade, she is my favorite. She challenges the kids and works with their skill level. Jade has a great attitude, is very enthusiastic and you can tell she really cares about instilling good form while building the fundamentals of gymnastics in her students. I highly recommend this school for kids 2 years and above!",positive
"The staff here is amazing. I have two kids in the program. One is in the Ninja class with Shylar. She is incredible! She has so much energy and excitement for the kids every time we see her! My son LOVES her! My daughter, who has Down syndrome, has Emma. She has been unbelievable with my daughter in regards to acceptance, patience and making her (and myself) feel so comfortable. She works with my daughter to make sure she is just like any other child in the class. For anyone with a child with special needs this is such a breath of fresh air! I love this place and their fantastic staff! I would give more stars if I could!",positive
"This place is fabulous! I am a teacher who works in early childhood, and this is by far the most developmentally appropriate facility for children in sports that I have found. Both of my children absolutely love their classes. What an awesome place!",positive
Everyone is so nice and they are really patient. My almost two year old is learning so many great skills. He loves the baby dance class and tumble tots is a blessing when you're trying to teach structure. The open gym is an inexpensive and fun way to beat the heat and it's better than going to the park! I love this place!,positive
"Words could never express just how wonderful Arizona Sunrays is. They have literately changed our kids lives. Both of our kids were born with hypotonia and you would never know it. Thanks to the amazing staff, spectacular camp and exceptional after school program our children have developed an incredible self awareness, skill set and confidence. Coaches Kim, Jumping Jeanie and GM Kenzie along with the rest of the coaching staff are very dedicated and it is so apparent.",positive
"I would have given them a 5 Star, bit the smell of this place makes me think of a men's lockers room...without ventilation. I am looking for a pile of dirty socks in the corner. Everyone who teaches here is awesome and super talented. They have classes for every age.",positive
"Very unaccomodating and expensive! If your kids cannot make it to camp one day of the week, they will not allow a makeup day and the price stays the same. They charge a ""late fee"" if you want to come the same day, and don't seem to care whether they turn away new clients or customers because they are more interested in money. Gold Metal Gymnastics in Chandler, although a bit further, is a better option. They are friendly, kind, and know that with children and our lives, things don't always work out exactly as we want. Save your money and go to another camp that cares about families and kids, and not about nickel and diming you.",negative
"This is an awesome place for Summer Camp/Birthday Parties. No need to second guess on that. My son went to the camp last year, as well as currently attending. Everyone here has a great positive energy, the kids enjoy a lot as well. They have Karate, Yoga, Swimming, Dance and ofcourse Gymnastics for the kids.",positive
Thank you crew for being an amazingly talented and gifted group of thoughtful and experienced gymnasts. Esther loves her gymnastics classes and collectively your organization has assisted in the development of my four year olds' talent for the sport. Teacher Kim and staff thank you! And thank you for finding a gym in Ventura County for us!,positive
"I signed my kids up for the Super Camp at AZ Sunrays for one week this summer. The kids have had an absolute blast. The instructors greet them warmly when we arrive each morning. I have been thoroughly impressed by their level of organization. The instructors make sure I sign both kids in and out (even when I forget!) The facility is clean. The kids are engaged from the minute they walk in the door. The camp is a little pricey when paying for two kids but well worth it. As much fun as my children had for the week, I will definitely be looking into classes throughout the year. Additionally, the level of customer service I have received has been above and beyond. I had an emergency come up while my children were at camp and when I called to let the office folks know I would be a few minutes late (as it turned out, I couldn't get back to pick them up until the end of the afternoon program) they were so kind and accommodating and made my children feel loved and well taken care of until I could get back to collect them. If my kids had to be stranded somewhere this would definitely be their first choice of where to get stuck!",positive
"Is this place still open? Their website has been down all week, and no one is returning my messages. We wanted to sign our child up after hearing such good things.",negative
I went to Sunrays for close to 6 years and every year was more and more enjoyable! The coaches are top quality and are fun and love to what they do! The facility is as clean as a gym could be and it is a great place for kids to learn both a new sport as well as other skills helpful for coordination and balance.,positive
"My daughters went here for yet another trial class - Tumbling and pre-k gymnastics. The facility had a cramped waiting area but free wi-fi (yay!). My daughter's beginning tumbling class were co-ed and had mostly pre-teen/teen girls which my daughter was not normally used to. Nevertheless, she had fun being taught and challenged. I did not have a chance to meet her tumbling instructor, but I did meet the pre-k instructor.",positive
Just took my 2 yr old daughter this morning for her very first dance class. Everyone was super friendly and accommodating (bringing out tap shoes for us to try since it was our first visit) and my daughter had a blast! We're both excited to go back next week. ;),positive
The employees are extremely nice and helpful; unfortunately this does not make up for the fact that the equipment is outdated and the manager lacks professionalism. I will never return here due to the manager and outdated equipment.,negative
This place really went downhill- won't stop pulling money from my account- they play this round & round BS game of call customer service- go to the gym- if you are considering this place buy a pre-paid plan with them that way you are not forever indebted! If anyone one has a suggestion or information to get the withdrawals to stop I'd be grateful to have it. ( after posting this I was contacted by the facility and the funds are no longer being withdrawn monthly) however the funds they withdrew over the last year were not returned nor was there any interest of repaying me.,negative
It used to be a great gym.... Management need to get on it people to clean every day.... Restroom smells and is filthy.... It's sad because it was a top notch gym a year ago... What happened,negative
"I've been deciding since my interview if I wanted to write this review. It's been a couple of months and there's no corporate contact information on the website. Just location phone numbers. I called in originally asking if they were hiring, the girl on the phone (co manager) yes they have two managers... said they were hiring and we scheduled a interview. She told me to email my resume, and to also fill out an application online. The online application wouldn't work, some type of glitch. She also gave me to the wrong email, I had to call back and ask someone else for the email and he wasn't even entirely sure what it was at first. So I go in for my interview, no one was at the front desk.. (keep in mind I was a supervisor at Chuze fitness in Tucson for 2 years so I know how a gym should be ran) finally the girl I had an interview comes to the desk, I say my name and that I had an interview. Took her a minute, and she finally remembered. First thing she asked me is if I speak Spanish. I am a blonde white girl.. (my last name is hernandez, I'm married so she was confused). I stated I was married and that my husband was Hispanic and that neither of us knew Spanish unfortunately. We sat at her desk (it was a complete mess, she was not prepared) and she introduced me to the other ""co manager"" who was unfriendly. She stated that they both had only been in that position for about 2 weeks. I don't know how either of them got promotions to that position, they would of been fired as a regular employee at the gym I worked at. Anyways so most of the interview was talking about how I was ""fully Caucasian"" yes she asked me if I was fully Caucasian. She also let me know that a guy who works there loves white girls and that he would probably hit on me (super inappropriate). The rest of the interview she read questions off of a sheet of paper and acted completely clueless/incompetent. I literally could of taken over that minute and done a better job than her that's how unprofessional she was. She then said well you were my interview but my other coworker also has some interviews he set up so we'll get back to you and if we don't then you just didn't get the job. So I'm under the impression when I left that they either hired a friend of theirs who will also do a crappy job or I didn't get it because I wasn't in fact Hispanic like she originally thought due to my last name being Hernandez. Super messy, horribly unfriendly staffed gym. Not impressed. They clearly had two managers doing the job of one person, kind of like in the show the office where Michael and Jim are both managers but they really only need one manager. Clearly these two kids were both totally incompetent so they had to have two managers to do the job plus a assistant manager. Also I was more than qualified for the position, seeing as they needed someone to open the gym from 4 am and be there till 10 am.. I used to do that exact shift 4 times a week as a supervisor at my old job. Basically I could have easily done her job, but 10 times better. They need to clean this location up it was awful!",negative
"DO NOT JOIN THIS GYM!! THEY WILL TAKE EXTRA $$MONEY$$ FROM YOUR ACCOUNT. The Blast fitness by our house closed and we did not want to commute to their next nearest gym location. They will not refund the $MONEY$ they continue to debit out of our account. Customer service said we had to talk to local gym. The manager their said talk to customer service. After my 3rd go around CS finally said they will not give our money back even though Blast closed our home gym with little notice. We have been penalized monetarily, don't get involved with ABCfinalcial.com/aka Blast fitness. Do yourself a favor.",negative
"Blast fitness is run by unprofessional and careless employees (even the managers). I showed up to a Zumba class one morning and not only was the instructor 20 minutes late to teach her own class but ended up leaving 3 minutes after. She checked to see if anyone was coming into the studio and didn't even take the time to wait for more guests although she had wasted mine and a few ladies time for being late. Their classes are not structured and aren't run well at all. My second example includes me being over charged for my membership - when I signed up it was a seventeen year old girl who took care of my boyfriend and I and it was her very first day she mentioned. She had told me upfront is 30 dollars, 20 dollars each month after that and the 49.99 annual fee would be charged in 2017 so I wouldn't have to worry about it this year. Well today I noticed the 49.99 charge so I went in to talk to the manager and he stated that promotion hadn't been going on recently so ""it was a miscommunication"". Although mine and my boyfriends listening was very clear because I wanted to know exactly what I was getting for this membership. SO not only did the employee lie to me upon beginning the membership or was not trained properly in giving direction, I will I not be getting my money back and the assistant manager said I probably heard it wrong.... And it's such a process to cancel the membership. NOT WORTH IT. And the hours are not correct on the website.. Lots of machines are always broken... The water vending machine has been broken for months... The sauna is ridiculously tiny! And bathrooms are dirty",negative
"Despite the fact this gym is not fancy with top of the line equipment and the staff is probably not as attentive as they should be, its great for what i need. And thats a place to work out. I come from a small town where neighborhood gyms were all we had. A couple treadmills free weights amd some machines spread out with a small strip mall building. If you are looking for a place that its going to hound you on rules, where the members are fairly plesant but not overly friendly, and you have the basic equipment you need for a good workout i would definitely come here.",negative
"Good gym, good rates, no BS, no sales pitches. Some of the other negative reviews mention really specific issues that are rediculous like the staff eating junkfood (apparently the employees HAVE to be on the paleo diet) or that they dont look fit enough and the reviewer would rather pay more to look at better looking trainers (are you kidding me???). Bottom line is this isnt a namebrand gym and therefore dont expect LA Fitness or Mountainside or EOS when you walk in. 4 stars because the free weights section tends to be a little chaotic with the weights unorganized throughout the day.",positive
"I love the gym and the equipment, but there is one specific problem. The equipment is always broken and they do not enforce any gym edict rules. No one returns the weights to the rack, people stand in front of the weight racks and worst of all everything that is broken never gets fixed. This along with the fact that everyone is on their cell phones and people take up multiple work out stations. What is the point of having staff if no one enforces the rules. This could be such a great place! Advice to management tighten up the ship, before there is no ship left!",negative
"Blast Fitness is by far the worst gym I've seen. The staff is rude. The locker room and bathrooms stink. It is dam near impossible to cancel your membership. You can't cancel in person, by phone, or by email. The only way is to meet the manager in person, who is never at the gym. They are a bunch of scammers. Stay away from this place!!!!!",negative
"Really POOR customer service. They don't greet you on your way in or out. Looking to switch gyms soon. And another thing, the trainer's act really cocky like a ""bad ass"" and half of them don't even look fit I rather pay more money and get better service. Horrible gym",negative
"I am writing to let you know how frustrated and upset I am with BLAST fitness. After a couple of weeks of not visiting the gym I finally decided that it would be best to cancel my membership. I went into blast in May to cancel, the gentleman assured me that since the new month period was already underway, I would still be charged for the month of May, but not for June and the rest. After signing some cancellation forms I was told I still had to email BLAST to let them know I wanted to cancel otherwise I would continue to get billed. I sent an email to BLAST informing them I wanted to cancel my membership; I did not get a response or anything so I assumed everything was done with. However, it was not until last month that I noticed that I was getting charged monthly by BLAST even AFTER I had signed cancellation waivers and sent multiple emails. I immediately changed my card to avoid further billings and am now being BOMBARDED with letters from BLAST demanding I pay them. So today, I again walked into BLAST to explain my situation. As soon as I explained the situation the gentleman at the counter rudely told me there was nothing he could do because apparently they don't keep any data in their system. (Weird, I would at least expect a legitimate business to keep record of all transactions especially within the last year) He told me that there was nothing he could do and suggested I try to contact the company they use for billing? (ABC Financial) I asked how long that would take because I obviously don't want to get billed for another month. He told me that most of the time up to two weeks and that's IF they even open it or even take the time to cancel my membership? I don't understand why people can't cancel at the location they initially signed up at? Why do I have to take so many steps, not to mention WASTE MY TIME AND MONEY if nobody is even going to bother to help? All I want is for you to refund my money that I was not even aware I was being billed for because your company doesn't bother attending to their own customers. Unless you are sure you want to be a member FOR LIFE, do NOT sign up.",negative
"I was told membership was $10 a month, and started getting billed $20.99. Don't fall for the gimmick! For $8 more a month go to a CLEAN gym. Overall the gym feels very outdated. The ""women's work out room"" is eerie, with 2 random old TV's, purple walls, chipping paint, dusty machines that make noises when you are on them...I would highly recommend going to a lively, inspirational, clean, up to date gym like 24 hour fitness, planet fitness, anything but this.",negative
Heard some pretty bad things about this place but it's not that bad. Great trainers great classes. Could have a bigger sauna but this place ain't too shabby,positive
"Better than Planet Fitness and all of their BS.. they also have Zumba, Spinning and Boot cam classes. The only thing that is not so great are the hours of operation and no pool...but hey for the money I can deal with it.",positive
"Loved it because the financial freedom they displayed, but just saw the marketing scheme that now has me member-less and paying to collections... Though I am not knee deep in dept with them, still the point is that I no longer felt like a member, but sombody who was a targeted and and quickly marked! I blame myself too for not seeing pasts the sweet promos and pricing, which lead me away from how the really make there money- the FINE PRINT as it's whispered to you... I know I know. I know this is the whole strategy and life line of most gyms, but I was surely pitched that of you quit coming it's left at that, period! No contract no worries jus pay per month and your good. When in reality, if you quit, we still charge you per month until you actually fill out paper work claiming that you officially quit and in return when you come to pay your late fees so the don't add up, and you get back in the groove, I get slapped in the face by them saying "" we will not take any payment, you now have to handle that with collections""..... Just a heads up on the cancellation process people.. Rules are rules and I'm sure there confident to show you where you signed.. Like I said, I'm am not knee deep, but I definitely felt the rug pulled from underneath me...",negative
"I started going to this gym when they first opened up and I currently still love going to this gym! I pay the $21 a month and it includes bring a friend every time and the group X classes us tanning. For the annual price $50 and $21 a month I feel that's a good deal when I can bring one of my friends EVERY time. Also this facilty is very clean when looking for a gym i tried out fit zone it had about the same prices and tanning but i always felt dirty and gross in there. The equipment is good, I'm sure if your a really fit male that works out ALL the time you wouldn't mind if they had a few more things but for me and my boyfriend it works. Also all your cardio machines have a tv and MP3 player and a fan. I just recently attended a group X class and I felt it was average but I can still attend different ones. Lastly, I find the staff very welcoming, I feel they always acknowledge me and my boyfriend when arriving and always say bye when we are leaving. To me the staff is always friendly and nice! :) The only dislike I have but not enough to give them less stars is I wish the gym was open later on Saturdays and Sundays! But thanks guys I will continue to be a blast fitness fan :)",positive
"Okay... I was a little harsh with my first review. HOWEVER... they still NEED more dumbbells, in smaller weights (I really HATE) using the pretty different colored ones because they come from the women's area. I look stupid using bright orange dumbbells, wth? They still need a squat rack, and they need a 2nd leg press (they have a seated leg press as well). I think I'll stay for now ;)",positive
The owner is doing the right things for the right reasons. Building a non-profit from scratch shows his heart is in the right place. Absolutely love the community that's grown from this still young and new gym.,positive
"This place is amazing! From the coaches, to the classes and the support received in and outside of the workouts; I feel motivated and driven to keep achieving my fitness goals. If having a good workout with talented coaches is not enough, your membership fee's also allow for them to offer free memberships to our disabled veterans! Shout out to Coach Nick McCombs for providing 1-on-1 training and ensuring I had the proper form before completing any workout.",positive
"An amazing gym for an amazing cause! I started going to Branded One CrossFit before they even opened their doors. I would meet them at the park on Saturdays for their free workout. And trust me when I say that they know how to make someone work. I was at a beginner level, and every workout would leave me sore for days. So sore that you have to fall down, not sit down. As sore as I was, it made me happy to feel that pain because I knew I was getting stronger. It has been so great being able to workout with Branded One CrossFit since they opened their doors. It is such a nice gym; everything is top of the line, brand new equipment. One of my favorite things about Branded One is that warm up we do before a workout. The warm ups are always really fun, like a game or something unique. The workouts are always challenging, and I honestly feel proud after I complete them. But the thing that makes me the most proud is that I am supporting an organization that gives back to the community. On one hand, Branded One CrossFit is like a normal CrossFit gym because it is open to the public and you'll get the same great workout as any other gym. On the other hand, Branded One CrossFit is so different from other gyms because it is a 501(c)(3) non-profit that gives FREE memberships to disabled service men and women. Even part of one's membership fee is tax deductible. So, that's why I truly love working out there. I am paying the same as I would at any other gym and getting the same type of workout, but I am also giving back just by choosing the RIGHT gym to support.",positive
"Great coaches, supportive classes and a brand new facility. Plus all fees support they're efforts to help injured veterans, can't beat it!",positive
"I just started at Branded One CrossFit when it opened July 4th. I had heard concerns that Cross Fit is too difficult but when I actually came for a workout the owner Nick and his other volunteer trainers worked with me to make sure the workout was still difficult but that my form and movements were maximizing my abilities while keeping me safe from injury. Since then I have been in workouts with some of the Veterans who are receiving a free membership. It feels great to know that my membership supports treatment for veterans and other service members. I highly recommend Branded One for Cross Fit enthusiasts, first timers, and people who just want to get a good work out and help others at the same time!",positive
Brand new facility in a great location! The gym is on the way to and from my work so it makes it easy to get my workouts in. Their full sized (handicap accessible) shower makes getting ready for my workday simple after a good morning WOD. The coaches are very knowledgeable and great at programming workouts for all skill levels. The community of existing members are very welcoming and make everyone feel like a part of the team . The memberships are affordable and part of my membership goes towards helping local disabled veterans and servicemen and women. Feels great to get a tough workout in and know that I'm also helping a good cause.,positive
"This place is great. I've been out of CrossFit for over a year and came in this morning for a slow paced WOD. These people know what they're doing, it's a smaller box that has a lot of heart. Super excited to get back into the groove of things! One thing that appealed to me is their Non-Profit status, and the work they'll be doing with disabled servicemen (they give them FREE membership)...which makes you feel like you're contributing to a good cause. I'm excited for their growth and all the cool people I'll get to meet through this box. Very unique, this is my new place!",positive
"I have been to several CrossFit gyms and this is the first time I have seen one that exists to only benefit others. The coaches are generous, supportive, and knowledgeable and the members are welcoming - which doesn't always happen. Also, part of my membership is tax deductible, which is pretty neat!",positive
"Love this new gym!! Not only is this a great place to workout, but they're also a non-profit that helps support/serve disabled servicemen and women! Branded One CrossFit is welcoming and has great coaches that can modify workouts for every skill level. Since it's a non-profit, part of your membership is tax deductible and it's also one of the most affordable CrossFit memberships in Las Vegas. This is a place you definitely need to check out if you're looking for a new place to get fit!!",positive
"CYKL is the best spinning studio in Canada for three reasons. First, they make sure that you will not get hurt. They show you how to properly pedal. In contrast, places like Soul-Cycle try to push you to do exercises that will result in injuries. Second, the instructors are super nice and awesome. Third, their bikes are unique because you can steer them (working your core and upper arms in a safe way), and the bikes moves a little bit left and right when you pedal, like a real bike! Nothing like it in Canada. And actually, the other riders are quality people. CYKL attracts a very nice community of clients that enjoy each other.",positive
"Cykl is a great spin studio. Their bikes tilt like a real bike and provide a ride that is closer to a real bike. The benefit is that you use your core and legs. The instructors are super friendly and professional. There is a good variety of classes, my favourites being the endurance classes. Highly recommend this studio to those seeking a great cardio workout and zero studio attitude.",positive
"I've tried my fair share of spin places both in Montreal and Toronto. Cykl is a really different but engaging ride. The bikes ""real-ryders"" are these moveable/turnable stationary bikes. The difference in muscle groups is noticeable. There is alot more ab engagement. I bought the 2 week unlimited pass which was priced at $49 plus tax.I went a total of 7 times so depending on your schedule and how many classes you can handle/per week, it can be pretty affordable. The best class I attended was the Cykl 30 Plus with Kim. I am someone who loves to go hard for shorter amounts of time rather than moderate for longer periods of time. The cykl 30 plus was perfect for me. Kim is a super enthusiastic and encouraging teacher. I really liked the plus portion which focused more on gluts and abs. Overall I would go back in a heartbeat if I lived in the area.",positive
"Really liked the class! I echo what the other reviewers have said - the staff is AMAZING and really makes you feel welcome without being over the top. They help you set up, explain everything, and even brought me a little stool to put my water bottle on (was too big for the cupholder and I couldn't reach from the ground). Class was energetic, music was great, instructors are helpful with tips and adjustments. Great job Cykl!",positive
"This evening was my first time checking out Cykl. I haven't worked out in a while, but I was very excited to get to it. Right off the bat, the ladies at the front desk were so welcoming and willing to help. This put me at ease immediately. The change rooms are small, but very well thought out. Everything you need is there: lockers, showers, blow dryers and even tampons! These guys thought of everything! When I got to the studio a lovely lady helped me get the bike adjusted and explained the different lingo that would be used during the workout. I was greatful for this as it made it much easier to understand what was going on during the ride. At about the 35 minute mark, I started to feel sick. I overestimated my ""threshold"" of how hard I could push myself :( I got off the bike and told the ladies that I wasn't feeling well. The same woman who helped me figure the bike out told me to drink water and rest. Feeling sick actually felt great! I haven't pushed myself that hard in a long time! I looking forward to finding the right pace for me over the next few weeks. Overall, this was a wonderful experience. There is no way that it could have been better. Thx!",positive
Best place for spinning in downtown Toronto! I have tried quite a few other spin gyms in Toronto over the year and hands down I get the best workouts here. Plus all of the staff are actually helpful and friendly.,positive
"CYKL is the best! I have tried 3 other cycling studious downtown and I must say CYKL is by far my favourite. The staff is personable and motivating and they do their very best to make you feel comfortable and even appreciated. They have a way of making torturous cardio feel uplifting. And their unique RealRyder bikes turn lean and turn similarly to a real bike, allowing riders to engage their core. CYKL is definitely my go to cycling studio!",positive
"This spin studio is amazing! The staff are super friendly and helpful, and even followed up with our group after to thank us for coming! They help you adjust your seat to the perfect height for optimal peddling and minimal injury. The bikes are so fun as they move side to side for ""turning"". It's a bit hard to get used to on the first couple of turns, but then is so fun! There are screen which play circuits on bike races, so you feel like you're right there riding in the pack! The music is great, loud, and perfectly timed to the hour workout. The bathrooms are clean, and offer many after shower products for the woman on the run! Would definitely go back!",positive
"This one is a winner. I have never tried spinning before and they were so welcoming. The woman was/is really approachable and down to earth and the instructor was very encouraging and even came down from the instructor bike to help me out. The facility was clean and I like the idea of the bike tilting 30 degrees. That's pretty cool. Great music too. I have been dealing with joint pain and was able to finish this class with no issues, listening to my body and following proper technique. So for those of you who are out of shape or even dealing with chronic pain or joint issues, do not be intimidated. Give this place a chance.",positive
"I was pretty intimidated by the whole idea of spinning but gave it a try thanks to a friend... This studio has a great positive atmosphere, very friendly staff, is clean (bonus: not smelly!) and plays good music. I've now been going 3-4 times a week for almost two months so I guess I'm hooked! You can book your bike super easily online and they have a whole range of classes to choose from morning/lunch/evening so you can't make any excuses :) Highly recommended",positive
Bought a 2-week unlimited pass to Cykl after seeing it on BlogTo and after one visit I am hooked. I was floored by the amazing staff and their willingness to help out and make you comfortable. Definitely a huge recommendation!,positive
"Cykl has just opened up and I was able to drop in for their free demo week. I've never done a spinning class before, so everything was new for me. The bikes used at Cykl are different than others because you can steer it. I found it a bit difficult to steer them and the handles would bounce around a lot when I had to move into a standing position. The instructors were very helpful in getting you set up and making sure that the bike is adjusted to you. The class was pretty intense, but I'm happy I was able to walk the next day! One thing I wish I knew was that you can request a padded seat for your bike. It's really needed.",positive
"I wish Yelp would let me give ten stars to one business a year. Because I'm pretty sure California Cycle Path would get those ten stars. Yes, it's only January. And yes, I've only been going there since December (a month ago). But I cannot say enough good things about this place. It was recommended to me by a friend. Over dinner one night in November with a friend, I had shared that I had decided to make some lifestyle changes that included being more active. I was never a very active person and I'm still slowly getting into better shape. I expressed my interest in finding somewhere to do indoor cycling or swimming during the colder months to keep moving. My friend understood this and explained that at CCP you can pay per class as you go, there's no sign-up fee or monthly membership fee. But more importantly, there's no judgment. I went for my first indoor cycling class early one morning. My friend said Larry was a good instructor to start with. He was very welcoming and supportive, told me that if I needed to just sit and pedal, that was fine if I couldn't keep up with what he was doing. That first class really did kick my butt, but Larry and the other people in the class were all very encouraging. I knew it would get easier and I had to push myself a little, but I had fun. I've since been to a rowing class with Lauren and John, a Zumba class with Laura and two more spinning classes (one with Larry and one with Lee Ann). All the instructors have their own style but even my second class with Larry was completely different (he even mentioned that he could see I was doing better). They have classes early mornings or evenings so it's easy to attend a class before or after work. On weekends they have classes throughout the day. My work schedule varies, but I try to find time to go to a class at least once a week. I've bragged CCP so much that a few of my coworkers are now also hooked. There is even a small lounge area where you can get water, coffee and/or snacks at CCP. Oh, and did I mention the peppermint infused cool towels they hand out at the end of a cycling class? If you can't tell, I've been chatting CCP up to anyone who will listen. I only bought a package of 10 classes to start because I wasn't sure if I'd like it or not. Boy, was that a mistake. If you're looking to get fit, get more active, or just something different but are hesitant or anxious over the usual gym atmosphere then you need to check out California Cycle Path.",positive
"I have to share my story with CCP and becoming a dedicated CyclePath!! I weighed 213 pounds, size 16/18 and started with a friend, Tammy in February 2016. We started with a TRX class and could not even do a plank in the TRX straps... While we were laughing at ourselves, an instructor, Eddie Pavlick, tells us not to worry that this is our baseline... We will be stronger soon! Flash forward to December 2016...We are STRONG! I now weigh 180 and wear a size 12. I am proud of my sculpted arms MINUS the old lady bat wings... Thanks to many TRX circuits and Sunday morning POUND reps. Two of the owners, Larry Crouser and John Bratton welcome you to their studio like you are family. Although most CyclePaths want to keep this studio ""our little secret"", we all are evangelizing the virtues of California Cycle Path.. No Judgement Zone!! A place to workout where you can walk in alone and walk out with CCP workout buds!!",positive
"Exceptional trainers. Exceptional experience. This place is home, and all are welcome to come. I spin and take trx several times a week. Sundays I take pound, Spin, and TRX and we call that the sunday triple play. Come and try itnfor yourself. Let CCP take you to new heights.",positive
"Today I went to this studio for the first time, and John was amazing. He was so friendly, warm and an awesome fitness coach. He was super fun and I loved the class. What I also like is that they welcome all levels, and everyone was really comfortable with him. I have already told my girlfriends about this place! I will definitely be back !",positive
"This is a fantastic studio! Wonderful owners and great people working out. I used to workout on my own at home and decided to step up my game, but needed a place that wasn't going to be too anonymous or too pushy. California Cycle is perfect for finding that environment. Larry and John immediately make you feel welcome and encourage you. I've also had some great classes with Lauren, Eddie and Jessica. I take Cycling, TRX and Pound several times a week and it's pushed me to do better in and out of the gym. Update: I just want to clarify that I always hear great things about ALL the instructors from other Cycle Paths! I only mentioned instructors here from which I've personally taken classes.",positive
"I am so happy that I found Cycle Path. I have been to a lot of different workout sites, but I have never looked forward to going back the way I do here. While I choose spin and TRX, there are other options for more or less intensity. How great to find a spin class where I feel like I am at my limit, but I don't want to see it end because it is such a great escape--instruction, music, and movement all working together! All that being said, what takes everything over the top is the respect I feel from the owners. Just sorry I did not find this place sooner.",positive
I love this place. The instructors make everyone feel confortable. The workouts are scheduled during convenvient hours. Most classes are available regularly and occasionally new ones are mixed in. Highly recommend!,positive
"Tonight was my first spin session here. I loved it! Everything from the instructor John, the atmosphere which was very comfortable, music, and newer bikes than I was used to. I think this place will definetly be helping me achieve my goals!! John was so sweet and stayed after class to show my friend and I what trx was all about. Thanks again for everything and you will be seeing me soon!",positive
LOVE this place! The instructors are great and will not make you feel intimated...even if you are new to spin like I was. I highly recommend CCP!,positive
"Awww - this is one of my all-time favorite places in Pittsburgh!!! As soon as I walked in I felt like I was at home. The spin classes are awesome, I love the TRX suspension also. The music is great. The best part is how motivating the two owners are. They are really great, have great taste in music, and are very knowledgeable about form. Unfortunately, I have a hip/back injury that prevents me from spinning, but as soon as I can get back to it I'll definitely choose the California Cycle Path!",positive
"1 or 15, at California Cycle Path the number does not matter because you matter. I was the only one able to make it to class this snowy morning. A lesser studio would have canceled class. Not CCP. I arrived to a shoveled and salted walk way and after I had my ass thoroughly kicked I was given a cold lavender scented towel to cool back down. This is what it means to really care about clients and how clients become friends.",positive
"I started going to California Cycle Path with the intention of working out for only a month to cram in as much exercise as I could before I was a bridesmaid. Well, that was about 4 months ago, and I'm still an active member! CCP is a great place for a structured workout in a welcoming atmosphere. Let's talk about the workouts, then the atmosphere. CCP is not a gym, so you won't be able to come here to stroll on a treadmill or juice your lats and blast your delts like at a gym. The core offerings at CCP are spinning/cycling classes, TRX Suspension classes, and Zumba. Other classes such as Deskercise, Personal Conitioning, Yolates, and Bone Building (for those at risk for osteoporosis) are also offered regularly, but not as frequently as the core classes. I've taken cycling, TRX, and Zumba; and they're all great. Cycling is great for an intense calorie burn and cardiovascular conditioning. The music is bumping, and there's a screen behind the instructor showing various cycling paths, or the Red Bull challenges, or psychedelic shapes that move to the music. There's a wide variety of music played, though I think it would be fun to have themed classes. For example, specific artist (eg., Beyonce, Britney, or Michael Jackson) or genre (hip hop, classic rock, EDM) class. The TRX is awesome for building muscle, improving coordination and athleticism. I think it was invented by some Marine guys, so, you know.... Zumba is the fun dancing exercise that's good for burning calories and cardiovascular health, coordination, and a bit of muscle building. I leave each of these classes sweating and happy. If you're like me, attending a gym/exercise class for the first few times can be nerve racking. I'm not in crazy good shape, I'm all alone, fitness people can be judgmental sometimes, etc... Everyone here is so freaking friendly, though, that after about 10 minutes, I was at ease. Here's the thing, I want to describe CCP as a family, because it feels that way. However, I always get a little antsy when I see a business described as a family. You don't always keep the highest standard for your family (that fancy hand soap is for guests!), and it suggests that there's already a formed group to which you do not belong. These worries have not materialized at CCP, though. The owners (John and Larry), the other instructors and the other members get to know you quickly, and you feel welcomed and comfortable. There's truly a variety of ages, shapes, races, fitness levels, and genders within the members. Cycling classes always end with cold, lavender-scented towels being handed out; the fridge is always filled with water and juice; there's always complimentary snacks and coffee available; the space is always clean; and I can always join or cancel a class through their website or app. California Cycling Path is a great addition to the North Shore/Brighton Heights area, and if you're looking for a different type of workout, give it a try!",positive
"loved it here! the instructors are knowledgable, enthusiastic, and truly care about their clients. the spin class was fun and entertaining and I was drenched in sweat at the end. the studio itself is adorable and unique, unlike the standard modern studios that have no personality. I'll be back for sure!",positive
"California Cycle Path is hands down the best fitness studio in Pittsburgh. Passionate trainers, and great classes. A great place for beginners too",positive
"OBSESSED with CCP. I'm a runner and was looking for a place to take some cross-training classes without paying an expensive membership fee. First class is free (!!!) and when we told them we lived close they gave us an amazing discount. GREAT classes and instructors that are so welcoming and do a great job of incorporating all skill levels into classes. Love the cycling so far, can't wait to try other types!",positive
"Early this year California Cycle Path added TRX, Zumba, and Bokwa classes. I think I should probably just set up a cot in the back. I am at CCP nearly every single day. The instructors are all incredibly motivating, friendly, and knowledgable. I have taken fitness classes and been a member of several other gyms, and none of them come close to comparing to the atmosphere of CCP. They have established one of the most welcoming, supportive fitness communities imaginable. From the beginner to the expert, there is most definitely a place for you here. No one should feel uncomfortable walking through the doors here whether they are trying to lose weight, tone up, or just maintain an active lifestyle. You will always be met with a smile, a towel, and the encouragement you need to reach your goals (from the instructors AND members!). Thank you to John, Larry, and the whole CCP gang for changing my life for the better!",positive
"If you are trying to challenge yourself, learn some technique and surround yourself with awesome people this is the perfect spot, i been training with CBCF for almost a year and its been and incredible experience.",positive
"By far the best CrossFit gym in the whole Phoenix Metropolitan area. I drive at least 30 minutes every day to come do classes with Coach Rob, Matt, and Jake. This is easily the nicest facility I have ever been to. There is nothing better than getting in shape surrounded by coaches and fellow members that hold you accountable and support you every single day.",positive
"Great community, upbeat, & funny; very positive. After a good, long warmup, Matt Rhodes coached a WOD in my wife's wheelhouse but kicked my butt. Would definitely go back. A large area with many rigs necessary for the group size.",positive
"If I lived here this would be my home box without a doubt. The coaches are amazing, Matt, Rob and Jake are great people. Everyone here was super cool and I looked forward to coming in and leaving it on all on the floor. I can't say enough good things about this box and I can't wait till I get to come back!",positive
I'm super new to Crossfit and was so nervous to go to a box but Rob and Matt are both super supportive and amazing. I love the energy here. I was worried I would be waves behind everyone but there are all different levels and abilities here and the general atmosphere is extremely positive. I know it's a workout but it's my favorite part of the day. I highly recommend camelback crossfit.,positive
"I have a love hate relationship with this place. I hate getting up early and going, but I LOVE how I feel after my workout! Crossfit has worked much better for me because it is quick and it mixes mixes up the moves to keep things fresh. Way better than the standard gym.",positive
"I'm so glad I signed up for this gym, I visited a few gyms before finding this one and I AM SO happy I found it! All the trainers are extremely nice and helpful, I've never done Crossfit until now and I feel like I found the best gym to learn in,",positive
"It's been almost 2 years and still, everyday. .. Matt, Rob, Dom (coaches) always, without fail, greet you with a smile. This place continues to inspire me to work hard and show up. How could you not enjoy coming to the gym when every single workout is difficult bit you're getting cheered on by your coaches and classmates? It's just great. And the coaching is constant with little tips to keep your form on cue. They've added a smoothie bar which offers delicious drinks. I'm still so happy I found this on my first foray into the crossfit community.",positive
"Camelback Crossfit is a fantastic box full of fantastic people. I'm new to crossfit and from the very first day I felt welcomed and supported by everyone. In the past I have always needed to have a personal trainer in order to force myself to get into the gym. Since I started at Camelback, I am actually motivated each day to get to the box and workout. I'm fortunate to have found this place.",positive
"There are a lot of great things to say about Camelback crossfit, great coaches, family atmosphere, very clean, great equipment, free tampons a plus in my book. But the coaches make a difference, they take the time to help you out with form and technique and encourage you thought the workout. Everyone is great.",positive
"Coach Rob's favorite music is country. ...This alone deserves 5 stars. But in all seriousness, I'm no true crossfitrer, but CBCF is the perfect crossfit gym to supplement my normal bodybuilding-style lifting with. Haven't been in very consistently due to jacking my back up (unrelated to their gym), but I always enjoy the challenge these guys put forward with their workouts when I do make it in.",positive
"As good as it gets is right. Camelback CrossFit has it all: the coaches, the community, the equipment, the location, and the price. I've been CrossFitting for 5 years, and CBCF is among the top boxes I've ever been to. Their attention to individual athlete needs, and their ability to scale and push you to work on your weaknesses is bar none. The community is a great group of diverse people who will laugh with you and not judge you, whether you are a beginner or at the elite level. If you're in the South Scottsdale area, this is the gym for you. Can't recommend enough.",positive
Excellent facility. Outstanding coaches. If you want a gym that motivates you to get in the best shape you have ever been in then go and take one of coach matts classes. A+ and 5 stars.,positive
"If you want to become stronger, more mobile and an overall better athlete you have to come to camelback crossfit! The coaches are amazing, always willing to help you better yourself and the atmosphere is great. Awesome sense of community. As an exercise physiologist myself, I recommend this gym to everyone.",positive
"Having been a Crossfit athlete for almost three years now, I have had the opportunity to visit multiple gyms, but let me fill you in on a little information about Camelback. Joining just over a month or so ago, I have not only seen tremendous improvements in my overall performance, but I have never been pushed harder than when I train at Camelback. All of the coaches take time to get to know each athlete individually and more importantly they work with each athlete to understand exactly where they are in performance abilities. When needed, the coaches will work one on one with athletes to ensure proper form and make sure each athlete knows that their overall well being is a priority of the coaches. The overall atmosphere of this gym is welcoming and is truly like one big family. I was taken into the family with arms wide open and each individual that trains here is unique in their own way. This gym offers something for everyone; from beginner to skilled athlete. Without a doubt, you will be pushed to the limits.",positive
"You can't go wrong choosing Camelback CrossFit. The workouts are well planned, the coaches are knowledgable and friendly, and the people who you meet here become your family. Cost-wise it's also one of the most affordable CrossFit gyms in the valley! I love working out here and would recommend it to any of my friends looking to get fit.",positive
Been coming to camelback crossfit for the past 2 months now and it has been a fun and welcoming experience. The workouts are well planned out and challenging. The coaches are great and really encourage you in the right way. I really like how they advise me to use a safe amount of weight. They really want you to have a safe workout and dont pressure you to be lifting crazy amounts of weight overnight! The group that works out at this gym are the BEST! Everyone is super nice and really encouraging. Crossfit can be very intimidating and I felt welcome right away!,positive
"Let's see where to start... I original joined this gym (Box) in January 2014 when it was known as Scottsdale Health Care (SHC). So, I too was recently on Yelp, looking for the perfect fit. As such, I was skeptical of a lot of reviews because of biases or a person's one bad experience. With that said I would like to add my review to help you. I must warn you though... I'm obsessed with Camelback Crossfit (CBCF); it's like a 2nd home, and I have no intentions of vacating anytime in the near future. I'm going to squat here until I die! The review is most definitely going to be a little biased. I mean what would you expect? That was a rhetorical question. I will however try my best to be as neutral as possible, or a voice of reason so to speak. Atmosphere: Now you have to understand, at the end of the day, I am an introvert. During the rest of the day it just depends on whether or not I made it to CBCF, or if I am Hangry, or Sleep Deprived, the Vibes (Yep! Said it) around me, and/or alcohol :p. This makes interacting with new people in an unknown territory a lot of work! I will also state the fact that I did try out a couple other Crossfit gyms, of which, I had friends at, until I found CBCF. Justly so, the atmosphere makes this place, like so many have said before. I was content with getting in, doing the work out and leaving. Now I get there early, shoot the shit during, and hate leaving after. I've never had that feeling at any other gym in my life! It's just something you have to come and feel for yourself. Feel them vibes! WOD (Work Out of the Day): A different hour long adventure every day! Very rare to do something twice in a month, except for weightlifting, but they differ in set and reps each week. Here's honest for you... It won't be easy at first, Crossfits a whole different workout, but you'll make it through and be damn proud of it! They've also recently added new classes such as Crossfit 101 & 102, Olympic Lifting, and Running Endurance & Mobility. There's whisper of a Yoga class being added too! People: Do you know how hard it is to be cordial at 5 in the morning? Would you believe me if I told you I was warmly welcomed at 5am? Do I need to expand more on the people/community of this place? How often have you competed against friends who are cheering for you before, during, and after? People who challenge you to get one more rep? Or add 5 more pounds on the bar? Who want to see you grow into the person you dream of being physically and mentally? And as the days and months go on I continue to become friends with more and more old and new members alike here. Coaches: I have had the privilege of being trained by Matt, Dom, and Rob, but will not forget to mention Brady. All of whom are constantly improving everyone's form on lifts and movements alike, as well as motivating people to their next plateaus. They truly know what they are talking about and rightfully so given the title Coach. Remember that atmosphere I was talking about? The coaches here are the driving factor behind it and have earned respect, not asked for it. You won't come into this place and be forgotten about! Price: Can't beat it! At least for a Crossfit Membership. Yes, I do know, I count shit for a living, and it was a big factor when I initially chose CBCF. $115 for an individual. Discounted to $100 for Military (thank you btw) and students. $200 for 2 family Members. Why I chose Camelback Crossfit: See above",positive
Love this gym. Used to be at a box in chandler and these guys do it better for less cost. Great location and awesome facility. They have me excited to work out again. Would recommend to anyone looking to find an affordable crossfit in Scottsdale or just trying to get involved with xfit. Beginner classes are very friendly and informative. Been crossfitting for a year and and am learning new things here every day. Best gym in the area.,positive
"Do yourself a favor and hit up this gym! The coaches, workouts and overall community are the best in the city. You'll thank me later!",positive
"I love this community!! When I started 4 years ago I was out of shape and overweight(no one told me this at the time!). Today, with the help of all the great coaches, I feel like the sky is the limit! If you're looking for a change form the same ol' boring gym workout, there is no better place than Camelback Crossfit!",positive
"Camelback Crossfit is a world class Functional Fitness gym located in South Scottsdale, or SoSco, if you're that guy. It's safe to say that these gyms all have the same stuff in them, but CBCF has one thing, that no other gym does- Coach Matt. Coach Matt is a tremendous fitness expert who provides quality instruction and training to all the members of the gym. Coach Matt is super encouraging, positive, and highly knowledgeable in all things fitness. In addition to knowing his stuff, Coach Matt also fosters a positive environment throughout the entire gym, so that none of the typical gym douchiness or cliques are a factor. All the other athletes at CBCF are very helpful and encouraging. CBCF has competitive athletes, regular people, newbies, and people like me who are clueless. Regardless of what group you align with, you will find a comfortable fit at CBCF! Everyone is welcome, and the veterans there are super helpful and supportive. I can not recommend this gym highly enough. If you're ready to change your life- stop your search and get started. Coach Matt and CBCF can help you reach all your fitness goals. If you are ready for an amazing experience, where you will work hard, and reap the benefits, then check it out. Why not you?",positive
This is an amazing gym! I had never done Jiu Jitsu and after 6 months practicing here I am addicted. The instructors are wonderful!.I love watching the kids class because they all look like they are having so much fun. And as for myself I am 42. All ages welcome!! Everyone at this gym is so inviting. You will feel right at home.,positive
"I had a really nice visit here, everyone was very nice and they had a lot of very accomplished jiujitsu fighters on the mat. The team camaraderie was excellent, even the parents were very involved and welcoming. I had the opportunity to see the professor when gold at nationals, and it was awesome to see the whole gym there cheering him on and taking big group pics together. If you are looking for a happy jiujitsu home I'd recommend this gym to anyone.",positive
Great place to train in Henderson. Clean gym with a family feel. Very knowledgeable instructors and awesome kids program!,positive
"I have trained many styles of martial arts and I have attended several schools. I have to say that Carlson Gracie Henderson has been the most enjoyable and informative by far. The master, Romulo Caiado, is at every class. No excuses. We have instruction every day. He is on the mat helping all levels. If you're a beginner, he helps you understand and practice the move. If you're a higher level belt, he really focuses on your technique. In a short period of time, the team has developed a brotherhood and it's always a positive feeling at school. I recommend this school to all levels. Come by and try a class and you will see there is truth to this post.",positive
"My family has been training with the Carlson Gracie Team for 3 years now and in large part under Romulo's and Bryan's tutelage. Their Jiu Jitsu instruction is high level and they have a good way of teaching it to adults and kids alike. Their dedication to the gentle art is unparalleled, showing up for all classes and all tournaments to teach, coach, mentor. So their track record of consistency is proven and makes it easy for my family to continue our training with them at their new gym: Carlson Gracie Henderson. The gym atmosphere is very up-to-date and clean, and I've seen the mats being cleaned multiple times a day to ensure all students safety. Two clean bathrooms and two changing rooms with plenty of space for your gear. There's also a huge seating area for parents to watch their kids at close proximity so they can see how quickly they progress. Teammates and training partners are all beasts and will smash on every roll, but in a good way because they will also help correct mistakes right after, improving upon each other's techniques. Egos are checked at the door and the mantra here is ""not about being better than anyone but being better than you were yesterday."" The class structure is a simple warmup, then straight to Jiu Jitsu specific drills so that students time isn't wasted doing calisthenics they can do at home. The Jiu Jitsu specific drills will leave you ""dying"" and thinking ""I'm good for the day"", yet you push yourself because you know it will pay dividends in your BJJ game. After the Jiu Jitsu drills and movements is the technique part of the class. A technique is demonstrated, then some variations of that technique along with various entry ways to get into that position to be able to execute the technique. This is drilled week long, along with defenses and counters. The instructors ensure partners are adequately switched around for all students to ensure enough repetitions, and also varying body types and what works for various body types and what adjustments need to be made for others. After the technique portion of the class come the live rolls, where you get to roll with partners of all skill levels from white belt all the way up to black belt. There's plenty of time to get in enough rolls to have you limping into and out of your car post training after a good hard workout. The kids classes are run in the same fashion, ensuring kids get plenty of jiujitsu specific movement/cardio, and repetitions for the drills and techniques, and building endurance and confidence up along the way. Romulo and Bryan are very mindful of mistakes made during live rolls and will correct them quickly. They also roll with the kids in a way that allows the kids to work on their base and balance, to try the technique and to learn what works and what doesn't as they put their training to the test. They will also incorporate games at the end of kids class that encourage jiujitsu movements while also making it fun for the kids, which helps keeps the kids engaged for the long haul. This place is a true team where strong bonds are forged through tough training and battles on the mats and in competition. You can expect blood, sweat, and tears here, but all in a good and positive way. Wins and losses are shared as a team, as all teammates help each other get better everyday. If you're looking for top quality Jiu Jitsu from genuine human beings, without all the gym politics of where else you can and can't train, this is a great place to start your training, supplement your existing training, or to continue your martial arts journey. Oss...",positive
"Honestly, I don't write much reviews but I have to give props to Charlotte RIPS in the area. When I first came here, I was hesitant to start due to being out of shape. I hadn't worked out in over 2 years, I ate pizza for breakfast and worked at an office job.... Being mobile really wasn't my thing. After getting a physical where my blood pressure and cholesterol put me at risk for some health issues, I decided to make a change. I didn't know where to start but I decided to try Charlotte RIPS. Right away, Vito was very knowledgable and helped me feel comfortable by walking me through the process of what to expect and what was expected of me to see results. I've never been a gym rat but this is a place that I truly enjoy. It's only been about a month but already my overall health has improved and I'm starting to see results. If you want to be in a workout environment that strives to empower you to work towards your goals whatever they may be, as well as start your journey towards a healthier lifestyle then I would recommend this place. Don't be fooled though, you have to put in the work. My trainer is Andre and he always provides one on one specialized training to work towards my goals. All of the trainers are dedicated towards helping their clients become better and they help you learn how to eat better and adopt fitness as a lifestyle.This place is affordable and for the level of service provided, I highly recommend.",positive
I have been working out with Charlotte RIPS for almost two years now- and I can't get enough!! The facilities are great but the knowledge and support of all the trainers are even BETTER! I am so thankful for this team and what they've done for me and the fitness goals I've achieved.,positive
"March 19,2014 I sat down with Vito to do my fitness assessment/consultation weighing 193 lbs, needing to purchase size 14/16s & XLs, & completely out of shape. April 2014 I started my journey not able to complete a push up but wanting to lose weight, get in shape, and be able to look ""good"" wearing a bikini. As a cancer survivor I truly just wanted to be healthy! From April 2014-present (yep, I'm still a faithful client with new fitness goals) I have watched my body transform! I'm still in shock by with my new body. I have lost over 30 lbs, inches, body fat %, & insecurities while gaining muscle, a new love for my ""physically"" fit body, education on the proper nutrition and fitness, that it will take to maintain my results, and an addiction to a fit lifestyle. In August I was able to purchase 5 bikinis to celebrate my 35th birthday & show off my new body in Jamaica! Replaced my entire wardrobe with my new size SM/Med and 4/6s! In September 2015, updated my goals to body building! I never expected anything less because I knew I was training with the best!",positive
I have been working out with Zack Scott for almost 2 months. I love the results I am seeing. Thank you for keeping me on track. Zack you are the best!,positive
"Zack Scott is my trainer and I almost didn't want to write a review because everyone will want to train with him and leave no space for me! Kidding of course, but he is great. When I see him, it is for 30 minutes twice a week and sometimes more depending on my schedule. He even made up a meal plan for me. I was training to go overseas and play lacrosse this past spring and he made me feel very in shape and ready to play. He is attentive and very cautious to what you would like to work on. I am personally not trying to become super muscular but I want to be in shape and healthy. He makes sure to work on specifics based on what I tell him I would like to do while also explaining why we do certain workouts in order to reach the goal I would like.",positive
I've been training with Zack for about 10 months & the results I've achieved have been nothing short of amazing! They provide an initial assessment which allows you to express your concerns (in my case to be toned but not bulky). Zack has helped me take my results to the next level & allow this mommy to wear a bikini again!,positive
"I tried Mansfield yesterday after getting a 5 day guest pass. The service is great, the gym is HUGE. For me it's a a bit too inconvenient to work out there regularly since I don't live or work downtown, however for those who do it's a really good option. There's lots of machines for both cardio and weight training. I don't particularly like the fact that it's a 6 level gym.....primarily since it's a converted theater so you have the different layers of the balcony sections and the main level and the stage. Access to the different levels and areas is also a bit restricted and and you really have to know where to go. There's a studio on the 3rd floor that is accessible only by a small elevator which is a bit odd. The studio has only 1 punching bag....1, which seems ridiculous for a facility the size of Mansfield. Locker rooms are quite large as well, lots of towels, a sitting area with TV to relax, steam room, sauna, coat room, etc. Pricing seems very reasonable for a nice gym smack in the middle of downtown, it's not cheap but I thought it would be more. The size of the facility is a bit overwhelming and it wasn't very busy for such a huge space, but overall a good downtown workout option and there's a restaurant on site that closes really early (also very odd).",negative
"This place is either the best example of how to launder money or the worst example of how to run a business. Here is the executive summary: The Good: The equipment (at least until recently) The equipments are top of the line brand names, at least until recently, when they started to remove them for trendy apparatus that no one uses, but would make the manager the highest amount of commission. The bad: Well where to start? the Locker rooms are filthy and a contagious disease waiting to happen, this is more evident specially during the weekends. And this is not due to lack of staff. In this place even the assistants have assistants. But no one seems to work in this place no matter which department. Whether its custodial, cleaning or accounting. Most likely because this place changes more manager than banana republics change presidents and none of them seem to have any business or managerial training. There are seldom a trainer on duty during the weekends as it should be. Whatever you do, DO NOT GIVE THEM YOUR CC NUMBER! they would charge you for anything and everything that they think of. Of course they would reverse the charges when you confront them but at the cost of your precious time and sanity. The trainers are there for one reason and one reason only to push expensive training sessions on clients. It's a shame because the gym used to be very good one, but it has gone down year after year. I used to be a member for 5 years but could not take it anymore. Do yourself a favor and check out other gyms in the area they are all better whether its quality wise or price wise!",negative
The absolute worst gym in Montreal. Staff walks around and think they are king shit on minimum wage. HORRIBLE ENERGY AND PLACE. You just want to leave the moment you walk in. So you charge higher prices and that makes you better? Idiots at large in here.,negative
"Beware! My locker was broken into at 6pm on a weekday, yet nobody saw or reported anything. I've been going to gyms around the world for 30 years and this is the first time somebody took a large lock cutter (I had a solid MasterLock in place) and stole my expensive watch, Bracelet and IPhone. Management was sympathetic but wasn't willing to put up a sign (""Anybody see or hear anything suspicious..."") and told me I should have left valuables in the small lockers at the entrance. Furthermore, I was told this happens from time to time and I should have known better...Well never happened to me in Toronto, NYC, Vancouver, London, Tokyo. There was a video of someone going into and out of the locker suspiciously while I was working out, but they weren't willing to challenge him and try to recover my valuables. They let me cancel my membership, but I still feel violated and hate Montreal and its dishonesty. I think of it every day... Wonder if it was an inside job?",negative
"Amazing gym. Good equipment, high ceiling and friendly staff. Haven't been to any classes yet but I heard good feedback.",positive
sent me to collections for 600$ for not continuing with my membership. if you sign for a year you're pretty much stuck with it..only ever went 5 times,negative
"I have been a member at Mansfield for 4 years. There are 3 locations. Downtown, west island and Brossard. It is expensive however the gym is everything you could hope for minus a pool. The staff and trainers are always very pleasant to deal with.",positive
after confirmed via phone that they accept Crossfit drop ins they refused to sign me up since I couldn't tell them the name of the person I spoke to. They value their bonus more than letting you actually work out....,negative
"People with money generally have it because they do not waste it. $130+ a month (for 1-year signup factoring in initiation fee) for a membership at this place is laughable. Yes, that's right, $130+/mo for a gym membership. There is absolutely nothing at this facility that would make me contemplate that type of membership cost. They are not even open 24 hours. They are not even open before 6am? Don't you think people with the means to consider paying your ridiculous membership rates have busy careers and would need flexible gym hours?? The whole membership age-related scale is also extremely offensive. Under 30 you pay one price, 30-34 another, over 35+ yet another price.In my opinion this amounts to age discrimination. But I could put up with all of that if I actually thought it was worth it, but for this price no sane person would cough up $130+/mo for a pretty looking gym when there are comparable options in the area.",negative
"Oh juste wouahou!!!!! Quel luxe! Quelle place! Quelle service! Tout est mis en place pour qu'on s'y sente bien et que l'on n'ait aucun inconvénient! Plusieurs choix de machines de cardio ou de musculation, un très grands espaces (il s'agit d'un ancien théâtre), un bistrot pour se rassassier avant ou après sa séance de sport (peut-être plutôt après), des pommes proposés à la réception pour donner un petit coup de fouet pour aller se défouler sur les machines, une plage horaire remplie de cours de fitness, yoga, spinning... Des vestiaires très propres, des piles de serviettes de bain mises à disposition, des sèches-cheveux et des lisseurs accessibles à tout le monde, sauna et jaccuzi inclus, de grands casiers pour y mettre aisément ses affaires... Tout est mis en place pour rendre la séance de sport agréable! Le slogan de ce gym que je proposerais serait:""Quand faire du sport est un plaisir""!",positive
"W-O-W, I am somewhat surprised and very confused about these two reviews below! I'm sad that Jim J. came across such an awful employee. I understand these two men completely, but so far my experience has been totally different. Here is my experience, I walked in for the first time and I was greeted I suppose nicely since I don't remember anything out of the ordinary... I asked the reception if I could have a tour or look around and the head Trainer happened to be near me. He grabbed me and eagerly said sure. So after we chatted and looked at the training areas, he explained to me that I had to make an appointment with the Sales guy and I did conveniently for the following day. The appointment with the sales guy was shorter then usual b/c I had already seen most of the facility the day before. I enjoyed talking with him, at first it was like a lifestyle interview and I told him why I was there. I was very impressed with the whole place. The women's dressing room is not smelly. There are fresheners everywhere. The showers, when I am there, are very clean. There's not even hair caught in the drain, which is something I can barely tolerate. 98% of the time I get the exact cardio machine I want. There are TV's with cable connected to most of the machines, requiring you to just plug in your earphones and you can watch TV while you workout. My one irk :: these TV's do not always work and this is annoying. I am there 4 times a week for about 1.5 hours each visit. It IS very expensive, I pay a permanent $86 and some cents / month for my membership - my rate will never go up. HOWEVER, your towels - they provide them and there are always plenty. There is not one, but two hot sauna rooms available in the shower area. Of cosmetic items they provide (and is included in the membership per month): - Q-tips, Cotton Balls; - Body & Hand cream; - Hair gel & spray; - At least 8 hair-dryers (there is usually always one available for me to use when I need it after a shower); - Shaving cream (& disposable razors, by request); - Shampoo & Conditioner (in the shower stalls); So in the end I thought it was worth it although I haven't needed to cancel anything yet. ;-)",positive
"Bravo b**ch at frontdesk with sh*** attitude!! Thanks to you, Mansfield has lost one (or perhaps just another) potential client. I was just there to quickly take another look at this place as I had to take a decision between there and another gym. Well she made my decision unbelievably easy and I thank her for that. In an amazing demonstration of rudeness and attitude, that girl at front desk on November 11 at about 2:30pm had me literally running to MAA where I signed in on the spot. I quote ""This is a private club, we don't let people walk around""...she said I had to sit down again with a sales rep and go thru the same questionnaire-filling bs. All this with her mouth full of the lunch she was eating right at front desk... Oh ok, so that's how you handle your prospective clients?I don't even wanna start imagining how you treat actual clients, LMFAO! I guess I was lucky it was made so blatant for me to see..I actually feel for those getting ripped off day in and day out. Besides...a weight room without even a basic pulley system, smelly locker rooms, charging $90/mth plus fees? Kidding right?",negative
"We have 3 boys ages 3,6,9 all in the program. What a difference 6 months has made. We love that they first drill and then are able to spar and practice in a real situation what they just learned. We love the student to instructor ratio. There are many instructors to teach and to watch and correct the kids form. Our 3 year old is getting a solid foundational skills that will help him when he advances to the older kids class.",positive
"Great place to train in Las Vegas. The mat space is very large with mats covering the walls. It is also very well maintained, since I've been training here I have yet to hear of someone getting staph or ring worm. Also note, what seems like the front door is really the back door. The front door is on the other side of the building. That got me when I first entered the gym. The training and instruction is top notch here. Professor Hector is a very knowledgeable black belt under Cobrinha. He focuses on all his student on and off the mat, as well as helping visitors learn the techniques. He encourages students to ask questions on the technique of the day or just any technique the student has in mind. Another cool thing about this gym is that a lot of famous jiu jitsu practitioners come here to visit. Just to name a few Cobrinha (obviously), Miyao, Denilson Pimenta, Bruno Malfacine. The jiu jitsu itself is amazing. This was not the gym I started my Jiu Jitsu journey, but how my game has evolved since I started training here is baffling. Come here and roll to see for yourself!",positive
"My two sons and I started with Cobrinha in July (2017). Since the start, I've been impressed by the skill and caliber of the students and instructors. It's unquestionably among the best I've seen. In the first few weeks I saw improvements in my sons' and I, and we have been building on that regularly. My sons have competed in tournaments and have grown through those experiences, thanks to Cobrinha. Not only is it a great school to improve your BJJ it's an academy with great families who are welcoming and kind. All of the the coaches/instructors are top notch and caring. For example, Coach Robert for the 7 am class is experienced and passionate. Coach Ryan in the kids class is always encouraging my sons and giving guidance on improvements. I am regularly impressed by Professor Hector (owner). He challenges the students to become the best version of ourselves both mentally and physically; he takes opportunities to challenge students to become better people in their everyday lives. If you're goal is to learn a self defense, healthy living, improve your BJJ, or even compete in BJJ, Cobrinha Las Vegas is the academy for you.",positive
"We brought our daughter to Cobrinha from another BJJ academy here in Vegas because we kept hearing the whispers that the kids program was second to none...and were BLOWN AWAY. We signed up the same day. Hector Vasquez personally teaches the classes and is on the mat with the kids the entire class (along with a minimum of 5 other instructors). The instruction and training is unmatched. Safety is always a top priority and every child is very closely monitored. It is very fitting that his slogan is ""evolve your game"" because that's exactly what happens when you train here!! Our daughter has not only grown leaps and bounds technically, but her self confidence has skyrocketed! I think what makes all the difference is Professor Vasquez's passion for what he does. He cares so deeply about every one of his students. We are so glad we found this place!",positive
"Visiting from MN, I was made to feel like family the second I walked in. Great family oritented atmosphere, but their BJJ is all business. No ego, no arrogance, and Hector learned from a living legend, Cobrinha himself. Go here, visitor or resident of LV. You won't regret it.",positive
"The BEST Jiu Jitsu academy in Las Vegas! I stopped by here while in Vegas for a few days. Hector is a thorough and precise instructor and it shows in the success of his students. The environment of the academy is awesome, everyone is friendly and the training is second to none. Whether you live in or near Vegas, or are visiting and looking to cross train; this academy should be your first stop.",positive
"I cannot say enough great things about this place and Professor Hector. I've been around for over a year now and finally got around to writing a long-overdue review. It's worth a read for anyone who wants to learn more about this Academy. Below I thoroughly highlight areas worth discussing about the Academy. KIDS PROGRAM Professor Hector is amazing with the kids, and it shows with the continuous growth in enrollment. Parents rely on him to ensure their child(ren) learn not only the sport, but discipline and hard work. His kids class put in serious work. It's crazy to see how he seamlessly manages 40+/- kids on the mat. He knows just how to handle the kids, regardless of their personalities and ages. Just watch a class, and you will see how much the kids respect Professor and the assistant coaches. BJJ ALL LEVELS This is the class with mostly adults and some kids/teens. What's interesting is seeing the growth in parents who are now taking part in their children's lifestyle. Couples, too, are joining together. It doesn't matter what belt color or fitness level you're at, Professor will make it work for you. COMMUNITY It's a family environment, which means anyone is welcome. Even if you don't practice BJJ and have a family member or partner that does it, you'd still be drawn in. PROFESSOR HECTOR For someone who sees about 50-100+ people daily, he knows every single member's name, and to me that says a lot about how sincere and passionate he is. He's not just there to do a job. He gets to know you and your weaknesses and strengths and helps you to develop an efficient way of training. During technique drills, he goes around the class and really pays attention to details and will ensure you have the proper form. As a white belt, I think that's important and he helps explain the mechanics/use of the move. Of significance to me is how accommodating he is -- when I was pregnant, he provided a safe training environment that enabled me to train up until I gave birth. Because I continued to train, I was able to stay flexible and thus had an easy birth. I came back, over a month later, and he continues to encourage and challenge me to get back to a more consistent/hard training. In addition to teaching, Professor also makes it a point to impart some words of wisdom or inspiration at the end of class sometimes. It serves to motivate us lest we become complacent. That's the kind of mentor/coach you want; not someone who easily dismisses the class after teaching. He cares--a lot. Many people look to a leader who's obviously good at what they teach. So whether it's scholastics or sports, we all want to learn from champions, professionals, and highly decorated athletes. There's a difference between being the best at something and being able to teach it. So, one thing to keep is mind is -- ""But how well can they teach?"" Professor Hector exemplifies both the expertise in the sport and in teaching it. So whether you're serious about BJJ or simply want to learn and be part of the community, this is the place to be.",positive
"Came to Las Vegas and decided to train at Cobrinha Brazilian Jiu Jitsu while I was in town. Professor Hector is welcoming, friendly, and an outstanding instructor. The other students were friendly and helpful on the mat. No egos and you can sense the passion everyone has for Jiu Jitsu. The academy is also very clean. I highly recommend Cobrinha Brazilian Jiu Jitsu.",positive
"Very competitive, a lot of skilled kids to help yours grow. My daughter is 10 with a gray belt and in her group she goes against mostly gray belts and yellow belts which helps her develop skills. Coaches are always there watching and giving feedback. The kids are constantly learning new moves. Hector is amazing with the kids and motivates them. The gym itself is full of trophies from the kids tournaments. I can go on and on. Basically I've been here for 2.5 months now and my daughter has learned more during this time than in 1.5 years at a gym down the street. I pay more here, yes. But it's all worth it. I can safely say that every penny spent at this other gym was money in the garbage. Here no, I am very willing to pay more because I get what I pay for, AND MORE!",positive
"When we came to Cobrinha my son had been practicing bjj for 4 months. We were very unhappy with his previous gym so with a recommendation from a friend we reluctantly tried Cobrinha BJJ. However, the moment we stepped into the gym we were warmly greeted by Professor Hector and his staff. He explained to us his philosophies and gave us a brief background of his bjj education and accomplishments. Following our meeting my son participated in a trial class and it soon became apparent that his first 4 months of training was a joke. In the first day at Cobrinha, he learned techniques and verbiage that he had never learned previously. Professor, the other coaches and the kids were very patient and willing to help him throughout the session. I couldn't believe the amount of unity and willingness to help that everyone has. After leaving we knew that this was the place that we need our son to train. It has been 7 months now and my son has participated in 3 tournaments and has won all 3 (including Pan Kids 2017). His growth and accomplishments are all because Cobrinha BJJ has given him the tools he needs to be an amazing fighter and person. Because at Cobrinha, Professor's philosophies of bjj are not only applicable on the mat but off as well. We are a true family at Cobrinha BJJ. So if you want your child to grow as a fighter and really grasp the concept of bjj come to Cobrinha. You will NOT regret it, we don't! Cobrinha BJJ!!!",positive
Professor Hector was very welcoming and instantly made my kids feel comfortable and like part of the group! Great atmosphere and family environment! Glad I brought my kids here,positive
"I had started training jiu jitsu in 2011, but I eventually stopped going 1. because of my work schedule and 2. because the school I was at focused most of their attention on the higher belts and getting them ready for their next competition and not so much on the beginners. I felt like every time I went to class, I was pretty much just a sparring dummy for the higher belts, who weren't interested in teaching me and just interested in smashing me and submitting me. When I decided to look for a school recently to get back into jiu jitsu, and also for my girlfriend to join, I actually went back to my old school to observe a class... and it was still the same. Higher belts on one side of the room and the beginners left to themselves on the other side of the room. Another big thing was the lead instructor was not present... That same night, I went to observe a class at Cobrinha. The first person I met was Hector Vasquez. He asked me right then and there if I wanted to put on a gi and participate in the class. I said I would like to just watch for now. The class starts off with Hector teaching the whole class a move/technique, and the class pairs up and drills the move. This is the warmup. No carrying your partner on your back across the room and back, forward rolling across the room, backward rolling across the room, shrimping across the room, etc., so that by the time you start to teach, everyone is already tired. While the students are drilling, Hector is walking around, observing each student, and making corrections/adjustments as needed. After the drilling/warmup, there is sparring. Throughout the class, the higher belts are mixing it up and working with lower belts and helping them. After the class was done, Hector talked to me some more, and told me that he makes it a point to be the one teaching every single class. Even if there are higher belts present, he will still be the one teaching. And by teaching, he is actually teaching, not messing around on his phone and letting people do whatever and potentially hurt themselves or the people they are rolling with. This sold me. I brought my girlfriend the next morning, and we both signed up after participating in the class. I am so glad we found this school. It really is a family atmosphere where every one wants to help each other get better. You can really tell that Hector is dedicated and passionate about teaching. Whether you are just starting out, or you are looking to maybe change schools, come check out Cobrinha and decide for yourself. I thought when you're just starting out, it doesn't matter much which school you go to, because they are all the same in teaching the basics. That is completely incorrect. I feel like I have learned and progressed infinitely more in the 3 months that I have been at Cobrinha, than I did in the 8 months that I trained at the other school. AND I enjoy coming to class so much more here! They are about to start adding an additional early morning class to accommodate more people's schedules. So come check out the school. I'm glad I did!",positive
"From the moment my sons and I walked in we felt ""at home""! The warm welcome along with beautiful smiles from Professor Hector, Coaches, and students assured me that this is the place I want to introduce Jui Jitsu to my sons, Nathan (8) and Hayden(7). I was recommended by my good friend, Ron Mortel, who's son, Jaden, also trains at Cobrinha. Professor Hector is great and respectful. I admire his warrior mentality while teaching all students the value of teamwork. No matter how long a student has been in the field, the humbleness and openness to all possibilities for a new student is welcomed with open arms. The energy and blessings of each spirit that is part of Cobrinha BJJ Las Vegas is remarkable. My sons are so happy they finally get to utilize their strengths and energy while learning discipline, commitment, respect, and responsibility. We have alot of work ahead of us and I am confident that Professor Hector and all the Coaches are always 100% present and ready to support, and make sure Nate and Hayden are progressing. Helen is a huge part of the establishment! So welcoming and informative. You provide all your concerns and needs, she will make sure they are met! Tonight I had the honor of attending the strength and conditioning class and I enjoyed it eventhough I had my ""can I do this?!"" moments! After 10 years of not working out and feeling hopeless with my fitness abilities, I am confident that I will get back in shape by signing up for the strength and conditioning class! Slowly but surely!!! Thank you, Cobrinha BJJ Las Vegas for all that you do! So excited for this journey and what we get to learn from all of you!!!",positive
"We started hunting for a BJJ place for our daughter sometime around June 2016. The goal was to find a place that would help her build confidence, further develop respect for self and others, and to keep her active. All the technique and skill she picked up would've just been extra. We've seriously got all that and a whole lot more. It all starts with Professor Hector and Helen. They were very welcoming on her first class, no pressure. Just to see if it something she'd be interested. She has gone from a reluctant, shy girl to loving everything about Jiu Jitsu and being more confident in herself. Everything about this place is second to none, from the way the coaches handle the kids' classes to the how Hector pushes you to get the best out of yourself. They keep it real and I've seen many kids get better in the 4 months we've been here. We started out with an average class of 15 kids in July and now I sometimes see 45 kids on back-to-back days. Most of parents I've spoken to have been in the BJJ game for a long time, have transferred here, and they all say ""This is the place to be."" It shows with the attendance and low turnover. Many kids come, not many leave. Our daughter has been in soccer for a year more than BJJ, but if given only one choice, we definitely would stay with Hector and Cobrinha for as long as we're allowed to. Highly recommend. World class teachers. World class family.",positive
"Had the pleasure of training the last time I was in Vegas for work. Great team, great rolls, and Hector is a great instructor. $20.00 mat fee but well worth it.",positive
"You are never too young or too old to learn jiu jitsu. Professor Hector and his partner Helen, along with their entire staff, were so welcoming to my family and I. My daughter tried out for their 3 to 5 year old 30 minute class which she enjoyed very much. Upon leaving at the end of the night, my daughter proclaimed to me that she could not wait to come back! We came back two days later and she enjoyed it. Hector works very well with children and their tournament results prove it! I'd recommend to enroll your kids here in a heart beat. The strength and confidence your child acquires and the technical skills to defend themselves could all be attained here. The sense of belonging in a very safe and family-oriented atmosphere makes this place better than any other gym in the valley! I also took the opportunity for a free trial class. I was provided with a gi to try on and, as a total newbie to the jiu jitsu world, I worked one on one with one of the students prior to the 7pm class to learn some basics. The drills were excellent and the next hour of rolling was very humbling. I was paired with someone much larger than me who I told not to hold back and I realized how much I still needed (and wanted) to learn. Rolling is a full body workout, but it is also sharpening yourself mentally. Despite how far this gym is to where I live, I chose this place for a few reasons: 1) The staff is very motivated and passionate about their work. They love what they do. 2) Their kids jiu jitsu program is excellent. 3) Professor Hector is a five time world champion. To be the best you first learn from the best. His modern jiu jitsu keeps you ahead of the curve. 4) Their customer service is top notch! Very important. In a city so saturated with jiu jitsu gyms, the ones who show they actually care about their customer is the gym I want to be a part of. Their facility is very clean with lockers and showers, two viewing rooms where families can hang out, refrigerators to keep your food in while you train, and they seem to continue to upgrade the facility with additional sofas I noticed up front today. Soon, they'll have to knock down the walls and get a second mat! I've referred quite a few people already (and their kids) and I hope to bring them by soon. I will continue to give them my highest recommendation and my family is looking forward to learning the Conbrinha way!",positive
"Let me start by saying I have complete and utter respect for the Las Vegas Cobrinha Academy. We were invited by the Fonacier family to attend a seminar taught by their kids this past Friday. Now being that we were out of towers and representing #ufc Torrance, Hector Vasquez and The Cobrinha family treated my two boys and my family like they belonged and one of their own. I even forgot to pack my youngest sons pants and they stepped in and loaned us a pair! The coaches were absolutely top notch, energized and helpful which was evident why this academy is one of the best in the world. Even though I work for UFC I'm also a huge believer of BJJ and as a practitioner ""great is great"" and I can say if you live remotely close to Summerlin enroll yourself and kids with Hector Vasquez and the Cobrinha Academy Las Vegas. I give this place a 5 star rating if I lived here we would also be students here! #cobrinhabjj",positive
"My daughter and husband started doing BJJ about 2 years ago, here in Las Vegas at another gym. My husband got injured after training for a few months, while our daughter continued. She found a passion in competing in tournaments, however, the team that she was with did not focus on tournaments, leaving my daughter stagnant with her BJJ technique and not progressing in competition. We started to see a group of coaches in bow ties at tournaments.. Not only did their professional attire stand out, but their passion for the sport and the kids on the mat. My family and I watched this team of coaches support their students, win or lose. Each competitor from the team always had a coach by their side, something that we were unfamiliar with. A few days later, we walked in to Cobrinha BJJ Academy Las Vegas, and we were immediately greeted by Professor Hector. He welcomed us with open arms, and our daughter felt comfortable trying a class with his students. The team graciously accepted my daughter and made her feel that she was a part of their family. We quickly made the decision to change gyms and train with Professor Hector. His business partner Helen, helped make our gym transition smooth and painless. It has been three months now, and we have seen a drastic improvement in our daughter. She has evolved both physically and mentally since being at this academy. My husband has even decided to go back to training, after seeing the family environment that the academy provides. Everyone is there to help you, not hurt you, and there are no ego's in the adult classes or the kids classes. We definitely made the right choice when we changed gyms. We encourage everyone to come see the difference in their kids that we have seen in ours. Thank you to Professor Hector, Helen, Coaches, and the rest of the Cobrinha Team, who continue to challenge, inspire, and support us.",positive
"Awesome atmosphere and all around great place for the family!! If you're looking high level jiu jitsu, this is it. All the coaches and staff made my daughter (who's 12) feel right at home. Thank you So Much!",positive
Incredible! Everyone is extremely down to earth. You won't find inflated egos at this school. Everyone helps everyone and the mass amount of talent is incredible. I'm proud and blessed to be part of such and amazing team.,positive
"My son is a Brazilian Jiu Jitsu student at Twisted Fitness in Madison, Wisconsin, an Alliance gym. When we planned our trip to California for the IBJJF Pan Tournament, we decided to go by way of Las Vegas. (No judging... please). My son had a great desire to receive training from an Alliance academy. He was more than excited when he found that Hector Vasquez had a BJJ academy in Las Vegas. He visited the gym and loved it so much that we change our travel plans to allow him more time to train with Hector. Training for my son with Hector and his students was an awesome experience. He can't wait to go back to Las Vegas (very soon) to do it again. The students were welcoming and demonstrated the hospitality that was obviously handed down by example of their Professor - Hector. My experience as a parent was outstanding. Helen Shelby (Director of Marketing) was so friendly and welcoming to both me and my son. I felt immediately at home with Helen, Hector, and the students. I couldn't wait to get back to the gym just to spend a little more time with these exceptional people. I genuinely miss them already and I've only been home to Wisconsin for a couple of days. We will be returning to Las Vegas just as soon as we possibly can for some excellent BJJ training and to visit our new and treasured friends, Hector, Helen, and the students. Thank you Hector, Helen, and all the students who made our travels complete with training, friendship, and a bond with the Las Vegas Alliance brotherhood/sisterhood that we love so much. Please take your kids, teenagers, parents, grand-parents or anyone else who is looking for some great physical activity, self-defense training, and first-rate Brazillian Jiu Jitsu to Hector and Helen at Cobrinha Brazilian Jiu Jitsu Academy Las Vegas or call them at (702) 527-5122 for more information and the best training and genuine hospitality.",positive
"I found them on Instagram, contacted them and was invited in. I was greeted by everyone and felt welcomed right from the gate. I've trained in numerous gyms on both coasts and I can highly recommend this gym for anyone trying to improve there jiujitsu game, for pro fighters or for regular fitness or self defense. It's for everyone!",positive
World class instruction! You will not find another gym in the Vegas area as good as this one. Hector will take your jiujitsu game to a whole new level. This is the gym and this is the team you want standing with you and pushing you to smash through your jiujitsu goals!! Cobrinha is the place to train!!,positive
"When I found out that they take 3 year olds to start training in jiu-Jitsu with no hesitation, I wanted to sign up my little one. And went she actually tried the class, she had so much fun. I'm so impress with the amount of PATIENCE the coaches have in teaching this age group. Now the entire family trains at this gym. And the best thing about this gym is that, everyone is FAMILY.",positive
"In a town full of ""MMA"" gyms, I was able to find a place to train jiujitsu that epitomizes the true spirit of martial arts...I came to train while I was in town and saw a Cobrinha gym had just opened up. Hector is warm and welcoming as a person and attentive as well as passionate as an instructor (that's not even touching on his championship pedigree). His ethic and attitude are well reflected in his students as they are all courteous with serious jiujitsu chops. Helen also contributed to the positive atmosphere of the gym. I've trained martial arts my whole life and still coach at my own gym in the Bay Area. There aren't many places like this...and it's refreshing to see that martial arts is still alive and well. Do yourself a favor...if you're going to train-make this place THE place for you and your family.",positive
"We live across town from this school but it is worth the commute. My son really enjoyed the trial class, so much that I signed him up at the next class. You are treated like family from the moment you walk in. He's been to 3 classes so far and has absorbed the technique very well. He enjoys it to the point that he doesn't want to leave when the class is over. I highly recommend Cobrinha. Once you take the trial class and you'll be hooked.",positive
"When I heard professor takes young students as young as 3 years old, it was a not a hard decision to make to join the Cobrinha team/family. Professor Hector and Helen has done wonders for my girls and provided the keys needed to live a healthy Jiu Jitsu lifestyle. In just less than 2 months my oldest daughter (8 years old) has change so much and change all her bad junk food habit to healthy habits. I know my girls are in good hands when they are under the guidance of professor Hector and Helen. I to am a student and I never seen such a big improvement in my game under this system. The thing I love most about this gym is it is really a family environment gym. Everyone treats everyone the same no matter if you a student a worker. I would recommend Cobrinah to anyone if they want a real family environment to evolve your Jiu Jitsu game. Almogela Ohana",positive
Hector and I have only met at tournaments when his kids team would compete against mine. His students were always the hardest to compete with because of their awesome technique due to Hectors coaching. Las Vegas has a new sherriff in town with this Academy. If you have a kid that wants to be great THIS IS THE PLACE TO BE. This is coming from a different school owner with no affiliation with this academy. That alone says a lot and speaks volumes this is the place to be.,positive
"Cory is a great guy and a great fitness instructor. He really cares about his clients and works to modify any exercise as needed. I attended daily group 'boot camp' classes and loved every one. There are so many different time options you are bound to find one that fits your schedule. The gym has an intimate vibe and is full of positive energy. Don't be fooled by 'boot' camp, its more of a circuit where you work to your level at each station. I definitely recommend Cory and Core Fitness!",positive
"Look I went to these guys two years ago. I was searching for a place to get back in shape and get motivated about my health. I met with Alex, a personal trainer at Core. He showed me some simple thing so could do that will not hurt me or bring further stress into my life. 2 years later, it took me that long yes, part of it was all negativity from failed workouts beforehand. It's been two weeks and I love the boot camp I'm in. I'm doing things that I thought I wouldn't be able to do otherwise, being ex collegiate athlete in the football arena. Seriously though, if you're looking for the place to get started the right way and learn how to exercise and like it or if you need to find your inner athlete...you just found the place. 5 star and thanks core fitness.",positive
"First of all I want to say that these guys are phenomenally talented at what they do. If you're unsure about starting a new fitness routine with a personal trainer, I strongly suggest you try out these guys at CORE Fitness; you will not be disappointed. I've trained with many private personal fitness trainers in the past, and was often left disappointed and frustrated. CORE Fitness is definitely a very different atmosphere that made me enjoy working out. I immediately felt the positive energy the very first time I stepped into the studio! They will help you achieve your goals very quickly! - assuming you do your part as a client, of course! My trainer (Spencer) is a very patient and kind man. He made an effort to go the extra mile and guide me through the workout routines in a way that I always understood. He never hesitated to re-explain himself if I was ever unsure. Even though I had my moments (like being stubborn or late showing up to my sessions!) he never lost his cool and was always a gentleman about it. CORE Fitness is a great place to train and improve your life. Thank you Cory & your awesome staff for helping me get this far and I look forward to moving ahead with you guys!",positive
"Simply the best Bootcamp to attend, personal attention was given to me to improve my workout and I loved the group of Worman who keep me motivated! I highly recommend Core Fitness!",positive
"Core fitness is small studio gym with group classes and personal training sessions. What I love about Core fitness is that it is never, ever crowded (group classes cap at 5 people), and you get a lot of personal attention for the trainers. I'm a bit self-conscious (I think everyone trying to lose weight is!) so it's great to know there aren't people looking at you or anyone intimidating around. The trainers are kind, knowledgeable, helpful, and never pressure you to do anything you're not comfortable with. They are willing to work with your schedule and have lots of different programs and specials. 5 stars!",positive
"I came, I saw, I sweet and I lost (weight). Thanks Cory! I could have never done this without the commitment of a trainer. Going it alone would have been fruitless as always.",positive
I have been training with Core Fitness for several years. Cory is professional knowledgable and very positive in meeting the goals and expectations of his clients. I highly recommend him. He has transformed my physique and I couldn't be happier with the results. Thank You Cory!,positive
"i appreciate how Cory allows for my unique physical, family and professional circumstances in developing a fitness plan that works for me. In addition to his excellent environment and technical approach, he is always enjoyable to work with. I recommend giving Cory a try. You will be happy you did. I am.",positive
Not many people using the gym. There are six courts set up and still have vacancy. Suttons and racquets are supplied for players. The drawback is the floor is slippery.,negative
"Usually packed on weekends and after 7, which sucks if you are working. Limited machines and racks, so if you are planning on squat day, make sure to do it in the mornings or just a bit before it's closing. No complaint about the staff. They are always helpful and friendly. The price here is way too much. Closes before 10 on weekdays (Mon to Thurs). If you are looking for a fitness centre, look somewhere else unless it's walking distance from your house (which for me it is). They do have other facilities that are included but the price is not worth it.",positive
"I've been a member at Cornell CC for 3 months now. Of all the Markham CCs, I would say this one is the best. The fitness facilities are clean, bright (lots of windows) and this is the only CC in Markham that has a large enough stretch/open space area for self-directed/mat work outs. The changing room is, for the most part, clean however the bathrooms are hit and miss. There have been a number of times where it was not well maintained, or toilet paper/soap had run out. The staff members are friendly. I usually go during weekday evenings between 6-7 and it's never packed. I haven't had to wait for a cardio machine or equipment so far. Overall, I'm a fan of this place. It beats a lot of those chain gyms like Goodlife or Fit for Less that are packed and humid during peak hours. I am on the flexible plan (month to month) and it costs me the same as GL or FFL. Parking is never an issue and easy.",positive
"Nice clean facilities!! Lots of wide open space. They could use more seating area near the pool viewing area, but they have the seating in the upper level. Coffee/snack shop available!! Nice touch. Lots of parking in the parking garage. Some spots are tight due to some drivers who have problems parking.",positive
"Lovely community centre. Very modern, bright and spacious building. I typically use the library, pool and children's programs. I took points off for the following reasons: the pool decks are not always as clean as the could be. I come here with my kids for swimming, as do many families, and I'm not sure how often the change areas are cleaned. The snack bar in the building is not the greatest. I've only ever tried their baked goods but those always taste stale to me. Have not yet tried their prepared food. Parking is free if you get your ticket validated indoors, which is easy to do. Overall it's a nice place and a beloved addition to our community!",negative
"Cornell is one of the prettiest and best community centres in markham! (Not biased, because I do take shifts there on occasion) This community centre is huge and definitely screams 'community'. It's located right beside the hospital and that creates the worst part of the centre - the parking. UGH! The parking is a nightmare on weekends and when there's a swim meet in the pool. There is simply not enough space in the little lot and if you have to park on the street, you'll get a ticket. I've actually been late for my shifts because I had to park in the residential areas ... are you kidding? Also, the parking lot is a 'paid' lot, as in you have to get a ticket and you pay on the way out at the front desk. (You pay after a few hours) The pool is lovely. it's huge, bright and spacious. The pool has a nice slide and a therapeutic pool- which a lot of pools don't have. It's definitely a 'hot tub' and it's a nice relaxing area after your swim. The pool is never really 'busy' as many of the markham pools are, and it's at a nice temperature so you can get a good endurance swim in. The viewing gallery is built for swim meets so it's huge, with a large overlook of the pool. The gym is a bit small, with not a lot of room for barbell lifting. I've only worked out there once, and the ventilation is not great. Had to stop running after awhile because I couldn't breathe well. I love the fact they have a running track. Indoor running tracks are just amazing. The facility also has a huge empty gym area for drop in sports (basketball, volleyball etc) and an indoor playground for kids. The library is very modern (the outside looks like burberry LOL) and the inside is organized and it just seems like a great place to study. Cornell is also getting a new cafe, which is a nice change from the other city of markham pools, which have nothing or a small dingy snack bar that's rarely open. This community centre is super spacious and very nice. I like to work here and I like to visit, even if I live on the other side of markham.",positive
GREAT SERVICE when booking and having my son's birthday party in the playgym. The party room is big and everyone complimented the cleanliness and location,positive
"Cornell Community Centre is definitely a welcome addition to the neighbourhood. With the increase of population in the new subdivisions, this is about time City of Markham adds more facilities for the residents in the area. Full Fitness Centre (requires membership), Group Fitness Room (city sponsored fitness classes), Swimming Pool, Running track, Multi use gymnastic area that have drop in sport programs for all ages, children playground and group and even a special area for Older adults. The only thing missing maybe is a skating rink, but there are Markham CC, Angus Glen CC if you want to go leisure skate. The building is nicely design and just need some finishing touches. Ample parking at least for now, I have to wait till everything running then I will know.",positive
"Great environment and great people to be around. Both Carson and Liz are very knowledgeable and do a tremendous job of welcoming people with open arms. They support each individual and their goals. They make the workouts enjoyable with variety of movements and changing up the pace from day to day, week to week. I look forward to coming back to the gym when I move back this fall.",positive
"I've been going to Crossfit FSI for just about a year and cannot say enough great things about this gym! All of the trainers are so nice, knowledgeable, and make you feel comfortable in your own skin. I've never done a move or been put in a position where I thought I was going to get hurt and I've never felt bad about my skill level as compared to someone else. The atmosphere here is so welcoming and the small class sizes make you feel like you have a personal trainer who is watching your every move and making sure you doing the exercises correctly. In addition to great coaches, the community of people here is unlike anything else! I can have the worst day at work or be really stressed out and as soon as I walk through those doors, my mood completely changes and I'm laughing within minutes. I'm so grateful to have this gym and these people in my life and I'm proud to say that I'm the healthiest I've ever been and in the best shape of my life! I would highly recommend this gym to anyone regardless of your skill level, age, or goals. Carson, Dallas, Liz, and Stefan have all been amazing to me and I don't have plans of stopping anytime soon!",positive
"After touring all of the crossfit gyms in the area, I chose Crossfit FSI and I'm so happy I did! Carson and Liz took the time to get to know me and my fitness goals. The other gyms I visited only offered a 30 minute introductory class to teach me all of the crossfit moves, which I knew wasn't right for me. At Crossfit FSI, They structured a program to get me get me up to speed over time, where I could learn the moves and improve my fitness at my own pace. Now I regularly attend classes and feel like I am making real progress on my fitness journey. Carson and Liz make the classes fun and challenging, and for the first time in my life I look forward to working out. Couldn't be happier with my choice of CrossFit gym and would recommend FSI to anyone.",positive
"Carson, Stefan, Liz and Dallas are the most knowledgeable, professional trainers as well as some of the coolest and kindest group of people you would ever want to meet.They always make me feel welcome and encourage my progress. I started seeing Carson a year and a half ago. When I came in I was still recovering from a broken back and spent a year of being stagnant while learning to walk again. Now I have lost 35 pounds while adding muscle and my back has never been stronger, I have no pain at all and I can now squat near 300lbs. My health has never been better and through their nutritional counseling I went from a serious high risk diabetic to complete remission. In the past I've been to other trainers who insisted on driving me so hard I would spend days recovering. At CrossFit FSI all the trainers know about my medical history and never to put me in situations where I would hurt myself or re-injure my back. They are very knowledgeable and always explain the science and benefits of the exercises in a way I can understand. Starting at basic movement and correct form they built me up from the ground up. I have boundless energy and my quality of life is amazing. They are teachers who love what they do and are always expanding their knowledge in both technique and extra certifications. They even follow up with with me after tough sessions to check in and see how I'm feeling. You couldn't ask for a better experience with some of the best group of people I know. Other clients I've meet are fun to be around and I've made some great friendships. I look forward to both my classes and my personal training sessions with Carson...that is no small feat for me:-) I completely trust them in both their skill and my well being. Their prices are great, the results are remarkable and I cannot give them enough praise.",positive
"CrossFit FSI is the ultimate fitness experience- just the right combination of cardio, strength, flexibility and mobility training while having fun with certified trainers and motivated clients. No two workouts are ever identical so you never get bored. The trainers provide guidance on stretching before and after workouts so you can perform at your best and get results. Their fitness programs help you look and feel fantastic. I've worked out with many trainers over the years and CrossFit FSI trainers are by far the best.",positive
"I love Carson and all the amazing trainers at FSI. Carson has kept my husband motivated in his workouts for the past several years. His attention to mechanics and flexibility prevents injury and maximizes results. My son, a high school athlete, trains here with several of his teammates. FSI does a great job of motivating them, tracking their progress and preparing them for the season. My daughter and I have also found a place to belong at FSI-- we take the yoga classes on Tuesday and Thursday evenings. It is a completely non-intimidating environment where people of many different levels can practice together and truly feel comfortable. I guess what I like best about FSI is the way I always feel comfortable when I'm there. I never feel like I'm being judged. Instead, I feel like Carson and his friends have an incredible belief in my potential and they're eager to encourage me along the way. You will love the fun and highly qualified staff at CrossFit FSI !",positive
"I really like this gym. I have only been training here for a couple of months but have seen great results. This gym takes it back to the basics which I enjoy--squats, lunges, jump ropes, stretching etc. I also like how they don't nickel and dime you for every service. You are able to try things out and find out what works best for you. The gym is ran by 2 families and you can usually meet all of them if you are there. They care a lot about their gym and are happy to help you. I have met a couple different clients while working out and loved the stories. One man was told he would be in a wheel chair in 6 month due to his medical condition. This particular man started training/stretching here and 6 years later he is walking--with a cane, but still walking. Many more stories like this one.. just ask Carson :)",positive
"Everyone needs to check out this gym!! Unbelievable repor with their clients!! They will motivate with the most positive attitudes!!!! Always achieving major results that you desire! This is a must have in your life!! Get a membership now before they blow up so big, you'll never be able to get a trainer. Oh and not mention.... The stretching they do, is life changing!!! Oh man!!!! The best!!!!",positive
"Well this is my gym and of course I love it! Lots of different training no one way for anyone. Want to workout have a good time workout on making your self more fit this might be a great place for you or of you are hurt they train lots of prevention and mobility, stability training and technique. Or if you just want to get stronger there is a weightlifting club as well!",positive
My girlfriend and I dropped in from San Antonio. This box has a friendly feel. It's large and has the equipment needed to get a great workout. Coach Rob is a blast. He put us through a great warmup and challenging WOD. He's super knowledgeable as well. You can't go wrong if you're on vacation and need a place to get a great workout.,positive
Iam very disappointed with this place and with its owner. He wasted my time once when he didn't show up for my first appointment and nobody knew that I had an appointment that they. Then a day later he contacted me and we reschedule the appointment but again the night before the appointment he cancelled me. For those reasons I consider this place is very informal.not professional and not recommendable at all.,negative
This was a great experience. Very welcoming coaches. Clean well equipped gym. I took an Uber ride from the strip where I was staying and I went twice. Very reasonably priced and a high value. I would go again when visiting Vegas.,positive
"Saw the add in facebook about a 6 weeks challenge and decided to give it a try. I was very upfront, all I care about is to get great looking body, not sport just ""body"". I came after another bootcamp, where I have stopped seeing results and was super exhausted by going 5 days a week. What I like about las vegas crossfit that their program built on lyfting. So if you want to explore in world of fitness, I would definetly recomend it. They start step by step, watch your posture, always making sure you do things correct way. There are bunch of people who is not hard core in sport like me, and I feel like Las Crossfit is only one place that gives a chance to try what is all about. TRAINERS. Beside the great energy vibe, understanding, they have an amazing knowledge of what they are doing and experience. Everyone is fitness trainer our day, the reason I trusted myselft to las vegas crossfit, because they are real professionlas. I cant stress enought about Jason And Allison. I think they take evrything what they do personally, and thats what makes people, even like me to go back.",positive
"We were vacationing for the week with family and wanted to keep up with our training. Our box in SoCal is Crossfit Saga but CFLV made us feel right at home. The wife and I took the early class after signing up and paying the drop in fee online. We trained with four other members and they were really nice. The staff was great, the place was clean, and plenty of bars/ weights for everyone. We look forward to visiting again when we take our quarterly trips to Vegas.",positive
"My 100th review will go to my 2nd home and 2nd family-- CrossFit Las Vegas! I know, I know, there's a crazy stigma around the word and the brand ""CrossFit"" that scares people off just from hearing it. I'll admit, I've heard some things prior to my decision to come here but I was tired of the normal routines at the local gyms n not having access to the equipment when I needed it. Ever run into that issue? Ever run into the issue of being intimidated by ""dying"" or ""getting killed"" or (insert some injury here) at CF gym? Well... I've been here now for 1.5 years n am still alive and breathing fine. Just stronger, faster, healthier, n am enjoying life a little more n excited to take on new adventures and sports. What makes this particular gym unique from the other 40+ in the Las Vegas area? Because some of the movements can be technical, they start u off working 1 on 1 with an experienced knowledgeable coach to take u through the movements and for myself, some of the most basic human movements that I've lost touch with especially a normal, plain air squat! Love the community that I'm a part of and love the challenges I face in the gym that gives me the focus outside of the gym to make my life even better! Especially LOVE having showers to use if I have plans to go out or before I go into work! Not a lot of gyms offer this to members! There's even a Noonie Goonie potluck (12pm class) every 1st Thursday of the month, they have grass fed beef, whole milk & eggs delivered for pick up, organic produce, GEEZ! I don't wanna give away all the perks without u guys checking em out! Cheers to more years to come!!! And if u inquire, let me know Butterz (my aka here!) sent ya!",positive
"I've never attended this box, nor would I ever. And maybe it's a bit unfair to judge the entire gym off of my experience with one coach, but I am about to be in Vegas for week long conference and was looking to drop into a box while traveling. Crossfit Las Vegas had been the first result in my search so I browsed the website to find more information about what to do when visiting. As stated, they ask that you complete an online waiver, as well as create an account to register for the classes. The information they obtained was the general name, number etc. as well as which coach you'd like to train with which of course I have no idea as I've never been. A little while later, I had received a voice mail from Joe telling me that he saw that I had registered online and was interested in getting started with Crossfit Las Vegas. Had then returned his call and got his voice mail in return, yet let him know that I would only be visiting and would love to hear more information about what was needed to drop in as a visitor. A few hours pass and I had missed a call from Joe yet again (this was during the day while I was at work), and proceeded to immediately call him back. When he picked up the phone I said something along the lines of Hey this is Brandy, I had inquired about coming to CFLV while in town, and he said oooh yeah, I didn't mean to call you the second time, I dialed the wrong number..... (what I took from that, sorry, was never going to call once you said you weren't signing up for a membership). Afterwards, it was almost like pulling teeth to get the information I had initially wanted, and could tell he thought he had better things to do with his time. Maybe it was an off day for him? maybe they don't like visitors? Either way, in my experience, Crossfit encompasses so many things. It's a business but it's also a community, and I'd rather not waste my time or money being somewhere that doesn't make you feel wanted.",negative
Worked out at the 6am class while in Vegas for work. It was great to be able to WOD while traveling. Everyone in the class was very nice and I got a great workout. The gym is co-located with another gym / weightlifting facility. At the time I visited 8/2014 the front room / lobby area was under construction.,positive
"Good place for a heck of a workout. Not really into cross fit but its good for cross training if done right. I enjoy the fast paced, push your self workouts though and you will definetly get pushed. Check it out but go with an actual understanding of what cross fit really is.",positive
"Okay. I have been a member of CFLV for almost 6 months now and should have written the kind of review that it deserves months ago. It is the continued outstanding leadership of the owner and the relationships that I have formed with the other members that has compelled me to finally write this review. So here it goes: I moved to Vegas in January 2013 and didn't know a single person in this city. I had been doing CrossFit for a little over a year and knew that my first step (before purchasing a bed or ya know, finding a job) was to find what would be my next CFit gym. I simply Google'd 'CrossFit Las Vegas' and whataya know. CFLV was the first to pop up on my search. I didn't even look around the site, research yelp reviews or anything - just needed to find the hours of operation and a contact. I sent the owner (Joe) an email and he told me to drop-in the next day during his class. (10AM). Now, as outgoing and fearless as I am, I was really nervous. To the point that I almost didn't go. It took the encouragement of the coaches from my previous gym and texts from all of my friends to convince me to actually show up. The 10AM class that day was pretty small, about 7-10 people (3 of which ended up becoming my best friends). Everyone was super friendly and inviting and the WOD was killer. Joe asked my thoughts when it was over and I told him that I was pretty convinced CFLV would be my new box. He encouraged me to try some other places, making sure I knew that there were gyms much closer to me..And that's when I knew this gym was unlike any other. Joe wasn't worried about another dollar sign coming through the door, he genuinely cared about the people and making sure they got what they needed out of CrossFit. Two weeks went by and I still hadn't found a job so I hadn't returned to sign up and pay my first month of membership. I had to use what little money I had on things like food and gas (so annoying) and I felt CrossFit calling out to me every morning when my alarm went off and I knew I should be heading to 6AM class. One afternoon I got an email from Joe, asking if I had been able to find a gym and how my transition to Vegas was going. That's when I was sold. Not only did this place care about me in regards to CrossFit, I was clearly valued as a person as well. I emailed back and told him he'd be seeing my bright, smiling face the very next day because even though I hadn't visited any other gyms, I felt confident I was making the right decision. I took a trip to Coinstar that night and showed up for his 10AM class the next day. Over the last few months as my jobs and schedule have changed, I am no longer able to make Joe's 10AM classes. I bounced back and forth between 830AM and 6AM before finally settling on the suicide hour of 6. Michael Ty became my regular coach and this guy seriously knows his stuff. He's tough and he may play Country music to irritate you, but his athletic and coaching ability are unmatched by any other gym that I've ever been to. The quality of training seen at CFLV in general is unlike any other that I've experienced. It's simply, elite. A few months ago I injured myself and my CFit career hasn't been the same since. I continued to push and keep up my 4-5x/week regimen before my body threw up the white flag. I have since taken the last 2 months off but kept my membership going in hopes that one day I would magically wake up healed. No such miracle has occurred yet, but I digress. Money became an issue and I was seriously considering putting my membership on hold as it was no use to me. Joe got wind of this and immediately reached out to me. He has since become an integral part of my rehab and re-dedication to CrossFit and I couldn't be more grateful. He has proven yet again that he cares about every single one of his members. Whether you're just in town to visit, new to town, or a Vegas native - consider stopping by CrossFit Las Vegas. It is full of friendly people who are always looking to expand their family of friends. (And give you a good ass-kicking in the process)!",positive
"Was visiting and my buddies from home wanted me pick to them up a crossfit las vegas shirt. Plus I grew up in Vegas, so I wanted to find a gym that I could send my local friends to. I don't remember the guys name but he was not helpful at all. He seemed super unfriendly and didn't really care about selling me a shirt. He was teaching a class so I can understand him being pre-occupied but that doesn't mean you can be rude. I fell in love with crossfit because of the environment and the people. In my opinion that atmosphere is a reflection of the owner/trainers. I didn't get a shirt",negative
"I dropped in as a visitor with my boyfriend last Friday for the 9am class. Vili checked us in at the front and got us ready to go. He was also our trainer for the class. I loved that there was only 5 of us taking the class. 9am is pretty early for Las Vegas. The space was big, they also had a lot of equipment. The WOD involved Tabata. It was a great work out, high intensity. Vili was a great trainer and coached me one on one when he had the chance. He was also encouraging towards everyone. Since my boyfriend and I have a house in Vegas we will definitely be back!",positive
"CrossFit hurts SO good! We have a love/hate relationship and I couldn't be happier. This is a long review. Sorry. But it truly reflects on just how awesome this gym is. If you have any reservations, please read and consider my words. If you're looking to REALLY get into shape and make a life change, THIS IS THE PLACE FOR YOU! Let me start by saying I wasn't stoked to join CrossFit in the beginning. My fiancé talked me into it and I went in with a completely open-mind. My mindset beforehand was that it would be your typical douchebag gym (sorry, just being real) and that there would be your stereotypical gym rats, girls wearing makeup with their hair down trolling dudes and ditto for the jock type dudes trolling girls. Ya know, kind of like LVAC. They also placed a lot of emphasis on community, so that worried me, as I'm there to get my workout on, not to make friends. How wrong I was..... I'm still a newbie and just entered my third week of On Ramp - which is basically a class that meets three days a week for the first month you join. It assists in teaching you each and every lift so that you've mastered it before jumping into the real classes. I've learned so much and my form is getting better and better. Mind you, I've never been a lifter. I've always been in Ballet, Gymnastics, running and Yoga. So this is all very new to me. I appreciate this class so much as it really teaches you how to master these lifts. This is vital as it will avoid future injury, and, well, you'll know what you're doing. Makes sense, eh? The coaches are incredible! In the past, I've participated in several boot camp classes around the Vegas area and am used to having some jerk screaming at me. It never REALLY bothered me, but it would've been nice to have some encouragement in the midst of all the yelling. I mean, I wasn't joining the marines, but it kinda felt like I was with all the confrontational yelling. Also, my previous Boot Camp instructors never really taught us exactly how to perform a move, whether it be lifting, crawling on the floors.. whatever. It was all about banging it out, which could result in injuries later in life. The coaches at CrossFit are completely opposite. They pay close attention to what you're doing and mastering your form in each lift. And it's not just lifting weights.. it's pull ups, sit ups, jump ropes, stretching, etc..etc.. They're very encouraging and have played a vital role in motivating myself and all of the other members in my current class. I honestly look forward to working out. I'm currently in the 7am class. And let me just say, I am NOT a morning person. Honestly, watching the sun rise to me is overrated. I hate mornings. I. hate. mornings. But the workouts kick a** and are an excellent way to start off the day. Oh, and, again the coaches play a big role in that. So getting up at 6am to work out ain't bad at all. They have a ton of classes available to work with your schedule. For On Ramp (your beginner month) their earliest class is at 7am but they offer other time slots. Once you hit the real classes and are done with your initial training month, they have classes that start as early as 6am but also have a zillion other time slots available. Another thing, is that they teach you on healthy eating habits. They're pretty content with the Paleo Diet, however, I'm not a big meat eater and I'm a lover of cheese. Don't get me wrong, that's a personal preference, but I've heard rave reviews in regard to the Paleo Diet, so it's definitely something to consider. I plan on taking any additional healthy habits that they teach me. To me, it will be all about moderation and making healthy foodie choices. Oh, and the gym is a gym. Straight up. No bells and whistles. It's large, open and clean. I must repeat, if you're looking to REALLY get into shape and make a life change,THIS IS THE PLACE FOR YOU! They have free open classes on Saturdays for people to come and give it go. You don't have to sign up, but it will give you a taste of what CrossFit and the coaches have to offer. I repeat: You don't have to sign up. The coaches allow you to make this decision, they don't pressure you into doing something you're not 100% in agreeance with. There were a few people in my first free Saturday class that didn't join and the coaches were like, ""Cool! Come back any time and have a great day!"" Give them a call, ask for Joe Marsh, he's a cool dude (or any coach) and they'll be happy to get you in for a free Saturday class. You are also welcome to email them. They are usually very quick to respond. Believe me, you won't regret it. Worst case scenario, you get a good workout in, meet some nice people and that's that. No harm done.",positive
"What can I say, this place is like a second home. I've been a CFLV member for 2 years now and I am in the best shape of my life. The coaches are amazing and highly motivating. You always feel like you're part of a team, yet the competitive element of CrossFit keeps you challenging yourself to work harder. Everyone encourages each other to do well and that makes each and every workout feel great, no matter how hard it is. The gym itself is HUGE. The workouts are scaled to your level so that anyone can do them. When I started, I couldn't do one pull-up, and now I can bust them out like I'm GSP. I highly encourage anyone to give it a try. I guarantee you will be hooked.",positive
"$10 Visitor drop in rate if your coach emails them to let them know you're dropping by... overall one of the largest and most spacious CrossFit boxes in the country that I've ever seen... if you're looking for a great workout to squeeze all those toxins out from a night in Sin City, then CrossFit Las Vegas is a good place to do so.",positive
"I had the lucky chance to score a Living Social voucher to attend CrossFit Las Vegas's On Ramp introductory session. It is definitely introductory, but the WODs are still pretty intense and you get a pretty good work out. My OnRamp buddies were pretty lucky because our group got Joe Marsh as our instructor. He definitely knows his CrossFit! He was able to teach us all of the right form and techniques for the majority of the CrossFit exercises as well as any progressions if we could not physically do the exercise yet. He even taught us different ways of stretching to help the tense muscles you get from CrossFit work outs. He likes to quiz the class to ensure that everyone knows the answers and he has a way of getting everyone in the class involved and pumped to get a good work out. I definitely enjoyed the OnRamp session and plan to join CrossFit Las Vegas on my next paycheck. CrossFit is not your normal workout regimen, it's definitely going to be a change of lifestyle and I can't wait to begin that journey with CrossFit Las Vegas!",positive
"Joe Marsh is doing a great job in explaining all of the movments and keeping us from injuring ourselves. I'm in the on ramp course which is an intro to cross fit and helps establish proper form for the movements. The end of each day is a highly intense workout which always kicks my butt, but its totally worth the whooping to feel stronger! I highly recommend at least the on ramp (that's all I have experience with) for anyone who either has or will have fitness and strength training as a part of their life!",positive
"I had the pleasure of visiting CF LV while on vacation last week and although I didn't workout there (stomach virus yuck) Joe did take time out of his day to talk to me and answer quite a long list of questions I had about his gym. If you're in the Vegas area and you are looking for a gym that is professional and welcoming with a very strong and supportive community, then you can't do any better than CrossFit Las Vegas. -Great Space -Variety of Classes -Trainers were at one point gym members who then wanted to become coaches so they're passionate and committed -Family fun events (BBQs, batting cages, bowling) -A welcoming place for all types of people regardless of previous experience or athletic/fitness goals",positive
"I've been working out at CFLV for almost 2.5 years now and couldn't imagine going anywhere else! The workouts are programmed to promote overall health, fitness, and results. The coaches encourage their athletes throughout the work out and even through community outreach! The classes are programmed to accommodate all skill levels and with the new location/management they are even offering a Barbell Class (weight training). Not only are the coaches amazing, but so are all the members. I consider many of them amongst my closest friends and love being able to workout with them every week! Bottom line: THIS GYM IS AMAZING!",positive
"I have been working out at Crossfit Las vegas for almost a full year now and absolutely LOVE this crossfit community. The gym is in a huge space with lots of equipment and a variety of different coaching techniques. Whether you want to get fit, lose some weight, work on your gymnastics skills, your olympic weightlifting skills, or get stronger, they have something for everyone. The best part about CFLV to me is the community that comes with it. The gym has wonderful trainers who actually care about your well being and are there to answer anything you'd like them to. Not only are the trainers wonderful people but the members there have helped to push me to do things I never thought possible. I am fitter than I've ever been in my life and it is all thanks to my friends over at CFLV. Keep up the good work guys!",positive
"Great Open floor plan. This gym is huge for a crossfit gym. But every time I drop in there for a work out it gets more and more of a LVAC atmosphere. The instruction is good if you get the right trainer. Some wont notice you if they don't know you, where as others are right on top of you making sure that every technical move you make is correct. The classes can be kinda big but they have enough equipment to support larger classes. So if you get in on the right day at the right time you could be getting great instruction and a great workout. But for the price I would expect a more steady level of instruction and not just the trainers helping their friends. But for a drop in from time to time its not too bad.",negative
"This is the best work out experience I have ever had! I am starting from scratch and these guys are helping like no other workout facility has. It is hard and they expect a lot of you....but they are motivators and the other members are so helpful. No matter the skill or fitness level, everyone seems to want others to succeed. They cheer you on and stop to help without hesitation! I am achieving gains in fitness I ahve dreamed of for decades!",positive
"WHOOO!!! I love this place!!!!!! It is amazing! everyone is great fun to be around, the trainers are skilled and knowledgeable!! I place is small but functional! Well laid out, and plenty of equipment! They also like to take the workouts outside weather permitting! They play tag sometimes too! they always are making the work out fun but challenging!! They do a Share the Pain every month were you can come on in and see what goes on around the gym and if you like it then you can decide to join it! Just check out their website for all that information. crossfitlasvegas.com",positive
"HATE Nothing. DISLIKE Availability of sessions throughout the week. Workout music is hardly updated. LIKE The simple layout and size of the gym. LOVE The motivational, highly skilled trainers. The various Workouts of the Day (WODs). Movements are scalable to any weight, disability or fitness level. Sense of community among its members. Ability to keep track of progress through actual whiteboard or Beyond the Whiteboard computer program. Availability of a microwave and refrigerator for pre- and post-workout nutrition.",positive
"Great folks that know the Crossfit techniques and have an enormous amount of tolerance for new people. The folks that work out at the gym are great. No egos and all are very encouraging. If you are looking to get in the best shape of your life in the shortest time, you must sign up at Crossfit Las Vegas!",positive
"If you are a crossfitter in Sin City avoid the buffets, and hit up CFLV. They have an amazing facility just south of the strip (walking distance from Mandalay Bay area) with great coaches. Its a crossfitters nightmare to go on vacation and not have a good box to get a WOD in. CFLV has you covered!",positive
"It is very rare you come across a gym that has both an exceedingly caring and knowledgeable staff as well as a true sense of community amongst its members. Don't be fooled, this place will kick your ass. But for that ass-kicking, you will not find a better equipped and better staffed CrossFit gym in Las Vegas.",positive
"I can't say enough about this place. I have been going to CrossFit Las Vegas for just over a month and already my body has changed. I feel stronger, look stronger, am losing fat, gaining muscle, and I have SO much more energy throughout the day. I just feel healthier. Joe and Zach are awesome; they really help you learn correct form and will nail you if you aren't doing an exercise correctly. :) Workouts are scaled to your ability- but Joe and Zach PUSH you to do your best and work hard. I leave the gym feeling like I have accomplished something and pushed myself beyond what I thought I could do. And to top it off, the camaraderie at the gym is like nothing else I have experienced in Vegas. Everyone is awesome, inspiring, and unlike most gyms around here, it's great to actually get to know the people you are working out next to! If you are looking for something to really get yourself into shape, and aren't afraid of a little hard work, then CrossFit Las Vegas is your place. :)",positive
"I dropped in today to CrossFit PHX... what a great place... awesome people and very inviting. If your in town and looking for a drop in, do yourself a favor and go to PHX!",positive
"I stopped by CrossFit PHX during a trip to Scottsdale. The gym, it's coaches, and it's members were great. I highly recommend this box!",positive
Crossfit PHX is an excellent gym with great staff and an even more amazing community. I think Crossfit PHX really helped me step into Crossfit with ease and knowing that I could ask the coaches questions at anytime was great. I'd for sure recommend Crossfit PHX to any one of my friends.,positive
I've been to a lot of CrossFit gyms. This might be the best one. Coaches are top notch. Instruction is on point. Community is great. I had purchased a groupon for another CrossFit in the area and ended up moving to this gym because it was so good. If only all CrossFit gyms could be like this! I will be back.,positive
Excellent gym. My wife and I have been going here for almost 5 years. Coaches are extremely patient and attentive. The community is like family to us.,positive
"I joined 2 month's ago and couldn't be happier. I'm already in better shape than I've ever been in my life, and I really owe it all to the amazing coaches at PHX. I'd heard a lot about crossfit over the years but never gave it a chance. Finally, with some free time this fall and on the recommendation of a close friend, I gave PHX a shot. I was hooked after my first class. The family is so tight knit and yet they immediately welcomed me as one of their own. They have all been patient as I've slowly developed my technique, and yet always push me to push myself further every class. Everyone is friendly and encouraging, and there to help. The free weekly passes over at core power yoga are just icing on the cake, and much needed recovery after a tough WOD. I highly recommend you check out this gym, you won't be disappointed.",positive
I travel often for work and have to find places to drop in. This is one of the best gyms I have dropped into! Great programming that is challenging and you feel like you got plenty of out of the hour class. Super friendly and welcoming box. I can tell they have a great community and still welcoming to newbies. I suggest anyone looking to drop in come here!,positive
"I am new to crossfit but have an athletic background. I did trials of many different crossfit boxes in Gilbert and Mesa and was not impressed with the coaching and the competition at the boxes that I tried out. At Crossfit PHX I have received one on one attention to my form and have gained strength in the two months that I have been attending. Additionally, I have constantly pushed by my fellow crossfit athletes as the experience level ranges from beginner to advanced. Other details that I noticed and appreciate are: large box, 20 racks and pull up bars, new equipment and plenty of chalk. Additionally, although I am not there yet, they have 4 rings from the ceiling and 3 ropes from the ceiling. I am personally greeted by every coach every time I went into to class. They make you feel welcome and valued. I was not sure that crossfit was with the money but Crossfit PHX is worth it to me.",positive
"Me and my wife are from out of town and needed a box to drop in for a workout. So we used the crossfit affiliate tracker and checked out reviews and found PHX to be the best one in and the area and after going there and meeting some of the staff we understand now why it's rated so well! The staff was very friendly and helpful, if we're ever back in the area we will absolutely be dropping back in here. I highly recommended this box!",positive
I was visiting phoenix for the holidays and dropped into this box twice while I was in town. The coaching and community were AMAZING. Everyone was super welcoming and it felt like home. Thanks for letting me drop in. This will definitely be my go to place next time I'm in town!!,positive
"This place is a second home to me when I come into town!! Mikal is as cool as they come and the other trainers are right in line. The atmosphere is top notch, and with their expansion, the possibilities are endless here! The workouts always kick my azz! I recommend anyone who is looking for a gym to definitely give this place a visit, you wont be disappointed. Thanks again to the staff there at Crossfit PHX, ill see ya guys soon!",positive
"For mind, body and emotions. This literally refreshes and rejuvenates it all. Helped me kick coffee and energy drinks. I'm told it helps kick smoking. Treats arthritis and any inflammation you have. This location inside of a cross fit building is the best one in AZ. I've been to a few others in AZ, even one closer to my home, this one is my go to spot.",positive
"I spent a lot of time looking at the different boxes in the area, and ultimately decided on CrossFit PHX due to the WOD. And I'm glad I did! As I walked through the door, I was instantly greeted by one of the coaches who led me through the registration process, and the owner greeted me as soon as he was finished with his workout. The layout of the gym impressed me the most. Everything was organized and accessible, and there were enough platforms for everyone to work on with plenty of space (my box only has one platform). The owner also ended up teaching my class, and he walked us through the movements of the day, making sure our movements were proper and that we don't hurt ourselves. The actual WOD itself was much more intense than the programming that I'm used to, but the community around me definitely helped pushed me to my limits. And after the WOD, all the regulars came by one-by-one congratulating me on a good job. I travel regularly to the area for work, and I've found my box that I'll feel comfortable dropping in every time!",positive
Came for a one day drop in and I was treated like I've been a member since they opened! Mycal was a great coach and awesome motivator. Workout was killer. Will definitely come back! They even let me pick the music!,positive
"Such a great gym! We came in from out of town to do one of the CrossFit open work outs and Mycal was super welcoming. He is a fabulous coach and gave us great pointers and advice. All the members were equally welcoming, we will definitely be back the next time we are in Pheonix!",positive
"Dropped in for a workout while visiting from Ohio. Mycal, his staff, the other out of towners and the regulars were all extremely warm and welcoming. As someone who is pretty new to Crossfit, this was a very positive and encouraging experience for me. Thank you to Mycal and everyone at Crossfit PHX for a great WOD and overall fun morning of fitness!",positive
Dropped in from Cincinnati this morning. Awesome spot! The members were all very friendly and upbeat and got some helpful feedback on lifting form from the coach. He was welcoming from the second I walked in. Super easy to find. They also had a great wod programmed for the day. If you're in the area I would definitely recommend stopping in!,positive
"Crossfit PHX is the best crossfit box that I have ever been to. The coaches are always engaged and encouraging in every person's wod regardless of size of the class. Anyone looking for competition will find it at Crossfit PHX - there is a wide range of skill and experience represented at the gym, but I am never made to feel inferior regardless of my performance on a WOD. The gym is clean, well organized, equipped with the latest equipment, and to top it all off has excellent qualified staff. Mycal Anders, the head coach and owner, is extremely passionate about Crossfit, an excellent wod programmer, and takes personal interest in all of the people in his gym. Even as one of the youngest crossfitters there - I started when I was 17 - I still have always been treated the same way as the most experienced participants in the gym. If you want to enter a new era of fitness in your life, whether you are a seasoned Crossfitter or a newbie, CrossFit PHX is the place for you! You will not be dissapointed.",positive
"I've been consistently going to classes for a month now. I have not only noticed an incredible change in my body, but an excitement to workout which I hadn't found at many other places. The coaches are down to earth and willing to help at any skill. The environment is welcoming and high energy!",positive
"Let me begin by saying I converted from Bodybuilding to Crossfit. Now that I've been in this Crossfit community for a few months I can give an honest review. When I began looking for Crossfit boxes to train, I ran across ~15 different locations in the area. What set Crossfit PHX apart was the website! From a design layout it was amazing! Full of information for beginners such as, equipment, shoes, workouts etc. you name it Crossfit PHX had you covered. So I shot an email to the owner Coach Mycal Anders and received a response in less than 15 minutes! I set up my workout for the next day ready to rock. You can't beat amazing customer service! Now let me get into the meat of this review Coaches: The coaches here are absolutely amazing! Derz, Caleb, Thatcher, Laura, & Caitlin are all extremely knowledgeable and caring. They take the time to teach everyone the PROPER way of doing things instead of throwing you to the wolves. Emphasizing technique, form, and safety above all else. This is HUGE and greatly appreciated. These coaches are the absolute best in the entire Valley! Community: The community at Crossfit PHX is fantastic! These people have changed my life and continue to amaze me everyday. So much positivity and energy in this gym! You're constantly surrounded by people who care about your success and improvement. I haven't experienced an atmosphere like this since my High School/College football days. Do yourself a favor and drop in, you have to experience it first hand! Experience: Overall, my experience has far surpassed what I could ever imagine. Derz (owner Mycal Anders) has done a tremendous job in building a FAMILY environment at Crossfit PHX. When Crossfit PHX says FAMILY - INTENSITY -TEAM they mean it! Greatest experience of my life! Make the choice to Raise Your Standard and come check this place out!

"So there I was, in my mid-30s, feeling a bit past my prime and lacking motivation to get off of the couch for the past couple of years. I was looking for a way to get into great shape but I needed something that would provide structure, motivation and added confidence (Coaching!!!) that I was on the right path. I tend to be a bit of a non-conformist by nature and not one to follow the trend -so natually I was skeptical about CrossFit which had frequented my Facebook Newsfeed over the years. Then a good friend talked me into giving it a try. Now the search was on. I had checked out some other local gyms but they felt a little bit ""commercialized"" and some looked a bit crowded. Then I walked into CrossFit PHX and met Head Coach Mycal Anders. This gym just had a different feel about it...a different character that appealed more to me than some of the others...so I gave it a test run, and now I am hooked. Initially I was nervous and intimidated; feeling overwhelmed with the thought of the intensity of a CrossFit Routine. ""What if I get hurt?"" BUT the outstanding coaching staff and supportive community at CrossFit PHX calmed my nerves and before I knew it, I am through my first 4 weeks and already feeling a HUGE improvement in my fitness levels. Most importantly, the staff here really focuses on utilizing correct technique and not pushing things too quickly for the beginner. They provide that extra ""individualized"" coaching attention I need that really pushes my comfort level through the roof. Like they say, ""Check your ego at the door"". I truly buy-in that they can scale and fit the routine to any and all fitness levels whether old or young, big or small. The people who work out here have also been incredibly welcoming, supportive and encouraging. It is like a family. In my opinion there is not a better value for your dollar than CrossFit PHX for fitness. This place is addicting.",positive
Love this gym! I just moved here from Jersey and took the last year and half off from crossfit! I was super nervous to go back! The coaches and athletes were so nice and helpful! I'm so happy to be back super stoked to find this gym! Thank you!!!!,positive
I have never been to a place with so many knowledgeable trainers and coaches. These guys really focus on technique and ensuring that your gains continue to improve. Everyone feels like family here. I recommend this place to all my friends.,positive
"Crossfit PHX is always growing with the latest in technology to track your workouts and process. Mycal Anders, Head Coach and owner, is an extremely passionate and enthusiastic about life and that translates into his programming and coaching. The entire staff and members are extremely welcoming and treat all members of all skill levels as family. Coach Anders ""Derz"" pushes himself and his staff to continue in formal education and certificate not only in Crossfit, but also Olympic lifting, mobility, yoga, and nutrition. This staff is well organized, personable, and dedicated to ensuring any member who commits to putting in the work gets the results they want to achieve. Amazing gym and incredible people to be around. -Mike Vega",positive
"First class facility and trainers, methodically sound workouts enabling their athletes to achieve every possible goal. Highly recommend this box above all others.",positive
"I dragged my sister into Crossfit PHX to get her to try it for the first time. Mycal was so welcoming as well as the rest of the class. My sister is sold, the facility was excellent, the workout was awesome. I didn't have any of my wraps and stuff, and one of the guys lent them to me. Thanks guys!! Definently well recommended.",positive
"I recently joined CrossFit PHX after switching from a box I belonged to for almost a year. From the minute I stepped into the box I was treated like family. The members and staff are so friendly, making your first day, drop in or transition welcoming! What stood out the most to me was the passion the coaches have for what they are doing. Whether you're there for a daily workout or training to become a competitive athlete, these coaches are there for you every step of the way. They are incredibly knowledgeable about what they are teaching and demonstrate the drive and support for getting you through the workouts along with running a smooth and organized class! So happy I gave this box and try and would definitely recommend and encourage others to do so!",positive
"Best Box in Scottsdale! Great atmosphere and great coaches. I've been to a few different boxes in the Phoenix/Scottsdale area, and the level of coaching is by far the best. Highly recommend!",positive
"CrossFit PHX is a fantastic box! I have been to several CrossFit boxes and this is by far one of the best ones I have ever been to. It is very spacious with plenty of equipment for everyone. From rowers, boxes, pull-up bars, ropes, to kettlebells and med balls and jump ropes - they have it all. Coach Mycal Anders knows what he is doing...he challenges you with a great workout, but also makes sure that you have proper form and technique the whole way through. He has an energy that will motivate you to push through the WOD, even when you are ready to just throw in the towel. He isn't just ""another CrossFit coach""...he has tons of experience in the exercise field, both academically and professionally, which shines through when he coaches. I highly recommend CrossFit PHX to anyone looking to CrossFit, whether you are a rookie or a vet, I promise you will love this place. There is a sense of community that flows throughout, which makes everyone who walks through the door feel welcome. I promise you, by the end of your workout, you will be hooked! I was!!",positive
"Amazing coaching! Whether you are a novice or a seasoned athlete you will see results at Crossfit PHX. I'm not just another member, but rather a part of a community. I actually know other members by name unlike my old gym!",positive
"Canceled my membership in January and as of June I continue to be charged $130 a month. I stopped in there twice and they have ensured it was canceled and would not be charged anymore, however I'm STILL dealing with this. I have called, text, emailed and NOT ONCE received a response. The business side is run terribly and not worth your time, go elsewhere.",negative
"Ever had your butt kicked in a workout but still managed to keep a smile on your face? Me either until I walked into CrossFit Blur. Justin and Jake (the Owners) have the very best and challenging programming in the Valley, as well as the greatest personalities to keep you smiling and laughing throughout your workout! Your age doesn't matter and either does your fitness abilities. Come check them out and don't let all the abs scare you, everyone is incredibly down to earth and kind! The only reason you would be disappointed is because you didn't give CrossFit Blur a try sooner!!",positive
Hands down the best workout! Jake and Justin create a fun/challenging environment. Great for all fitness levels. Tell them your goals and they will help you achieve them.,positive
"I really didn't want to like crossfit - but I love Blur! The coaches are all super supportive and fun. I started in the ""newbies"" class to learn the terminology and movements. They worked with me to scale moves that I couldn't quite do yet and gave me great tips to improve the things I could. I moved up to the regular classes after about a month and though I'm still not doing handstand pushups or anything crazy - I've found I can push myself much harder than I thought with proper coaching. Highly recommend, especially to those that think crossfit isn't for them.",positive
Great atmosphere. Great coaches and members. The work outs are legit and will make you strong AF. Stop being a lazy f$#k and get your Blur booty pump on.,positive
"We have dropped in several times to Crossfit Blur while we enjoy spring training and time in both Scottsdale and Tempe. Justin, Jake, and Trevor have ALWAYS made us feel more than welcome and are extremely accommodating given that every time we seem to drop in it is because we are away from our home gym during the Crossfit Open and need to do one of the events. They are always more than helpful and are amazing coaches giving us several tips and pointers while attending. I highly recommend either of their locations if you ever find yourself in the Scottsdale or Tempe area! Great gym!!!",positive
"After two years of doing Crossfit, I have never met more knowledgeable, patient, and supportive trainers. No matter your fitness level I would recommend Crossfit Blur to anyone. For the beginner or the experience you will have a great workout.",positive
Justin welcomed us into his box and it felt just like home. Great location.. very clean and well laid out. His coaching was awesome and everyone was very friendly. Definitely recommend stopping by if you're in the area.,positive
Great box ! Justin was very welcoming on our visit and the place was clean and well laid out. His coaching was insightful and the WOD was challenging! We will definitely be back!,positive
"I've been working out on a one on one basis with Jacob, co-owner, and he is truly amazing. I've worked out most my adult life, but I can honestly and still surprisingly say that I have never seen my body change and my strength and endurance increase so much in such a short amount of time. The environment is always a blast, and I always look forward to working out. Jake works with our schedules and makes sure to stay on our butts when we are slacking. I've already referred multiple of my friends to this gym, highly recommend it!",positive
"I was probably like a ton of you out there...mid-30's, married, 2 small kids, high stress career and no real time to exercise. I have a smaller frame so I wasn't fat, but I was absolutely and completely out of shape...hadn't run a mile since HS 20 years ago and found myself checking email more than exercising when I was a member at Lifetime Fitness. All I knew of CrossFit was what memes and cliches told me. Then I found Blur... Justin and Jake welcomed me in to the Blur family and I've now been going 5x/week for 7 months. I look better, feel better and eat healthier than I ever have in my life. I was never a morning person and now I can't wait to see the 6am crew M-F. Justin and Jake will guide you to achieve whatever it is that you want out of fitness...they build badass athletes and better people. They achieve this by fostering a culture of camaraderie and commitment, along with elite fitness programming. If you want to find out how strong mentally and physically you can be; come join the Blur family. I'm grateful I did...",positive
"I'm new to the crossfit world, and let me just tell you I was very intimidated but this year I told myself I wanted to join and be a badass! Justin welcomed me in and helped me out straight away, I didn't feel out of place (even though I'm definitely a beginner) everyone else in the group was so supportive and helpful, glad I found the perfect gym.",positive
"So I am a mid 40's guy who was kind of lost in the fitness game. I love to weight train and I have done the marathon thing. I was fresh out of residency and in a new town. Having let my fitness slip a little during residency I was looking for something different. Globo gym stuff was just not exciting me to get fit anymore. My buddy had been doing Crossfit for over a year at CrossfitBlur and told me I should give it a shot. I dropped in one night during a competition and it took me less than 2 seconds to realize Crossfit was what I wanted to do. Now I'm not writing this to convince you to try Crossfit because if you have made it this far you have already decided to give this a shot. I'm 2.5 years deep. Every single day is different, exciting and challenging. Classes run every hour on the hour from 6AM to 7PM with a small mid day 11-1 break. Hands down the best schedule in the city. There is not one hour of the day that I don't know a member to crush the workout with. I have never in my life been a part of a group of athletes that push me every day, and I played competitive sports for years. The vibe in this gym is so electric every hour. The coaching you will get from Jake and Justin (Owners and Regional Qualifying Athletes) is unparalleled. I have made personal gains and seen changes in my body by just showing up 3-5 days a week. It's the most addictive environment in any Crossfit gym in the city. You will be pushed outside of your comfort zone and it will make you the best version of yourself. We are truly a family and my wife and I spend time with a ton of members outside the gym. I'm in the most ridiculous shape of my life and it's only getting better. I live for this gym! There is no other Crossfit gym for me other than Crossfit Blur. Come play, you won't regret it! As we say peace, love, Blur",positive
"After being a part of the Blur family for little over 2 years I can truly and honestly say we are a family! There is no other gym like blur the atmosphere is always electric and fun. Jake and Justin are two of the best coaches and athletes I have ever been around and it rubs off on the rest of the gym. I have been to many gyms around and fallow a lot of them on social media and I can say with full confidence no ones programming is as good as there's. Day in and day out they will push you to your personal limits, but also encourage you through it all. I my self joined blur coming off of shoulder surgery, they helped me get my mobility and strength back plus more. As a former baseball player who's carrier was ended due to a injury I never thought I would have that competitive edge again. But blur has showed me that again day in and day out. Blur has all ranges of athletes, from former college athletes, to the everyday soccer mom. no matter what your goals are, weather they are to be the to get your competitive drive back or to maybe lose weight. I promise you what ever goal you have they will provide the tools to hit all of them, and you will have a blast doing it! Blur is not a just a gym it's a family and a life style!",positive
"I started off doing a ten-class package, only going on Saturdays. I was scared of the hard work commitment and I lived an hour away. Jake and Justin made me feel so welcome to the pack, along with everyone else. They never singled me out for not fully being a member (or for being a weakling). They always gave me the same attention any member would get. They were great at really coaching me, and scaling things. They were always there to help me get to the next level when I was ready. It's always been about the passion to help people reach their fitness goals than to run a corp. I love that personal feel they bring to our gym. It's been over two years with the BLUR gang and I can't imagine life without them! I LOVE this place! I have made awesome friends here. Honestly, I can't decide if the trainers, the people, or the fitness is my favorite part of BLUR! The trainers are caring, fun, super savvy, and just have the best personalities ever! If you give this place a try, like I did, you'll never want to leave.",positive
"You will have a lot of fun and you will get fit! The atmosphere of the gym helps and everyone works hard. Don't let that scare you though, it's a very nice and caring population of people. They like to have fun with each other and everyone is helpful. They are family and they will welcome you with open arms. Give it a try!",positive
"I can't say enough good things about this place. I am a 48 year old guy who never did crossfit but was intrigued. I joined Blur about 8 weeks ago. I quickly learned the difference between thinking that I was in shape and understanding what being in crossfit shape really is. I am not there yet, but I have quickly noticed results. I moved 2 notches on my belt line and have gotten stronger and faster. Every class is different which keeps your body guessing and keeps things interesting. Blur runs classes every hour on the hour, so I never worry about being late out of work because I know I can jump in the next available class. You don't need to register for a class in advance - just show up and work! I am on the older side for this place, but that said, there are members in there of my vintage and I felt welcome by everyone. Jake and Justin, the guys who run the place, are knowledgeable and helpful. They are also bring the perfect mix of Midwestern niceness and crass juvenile humor to every workout. UPDATE - 10/10/15 Well, now I have been at it for four months or so, and continue to see positive results. I had to have my dress pants altered because my waistline got smaller. I was going to Blur 5-6 times a week, but my body can't handle that as well as I would like, so now I am down to 4 times a week and I swim twice a week. I initially lost about 5 lbs since joining Blur, but I put the weight back on in muscle. I recently had my body fat percentage measured, and I am down to 17%. I am getting stronger and faster. I can do kip pull ups, and I can do a few double unders, but I still need to improve on the toes to bar. My speed has improved on runs as well, but I do need to make peace with the fact that I am not going to turn back the clock 20 years. Friends have noticed a change in my physique, so hopefully I will be at a point soon that I can have my shirt off at the beach and feel good about myself.",positive
"Been going here about a year. As intense as you want it. Convenient, classes all day. Friendly, knowledgeable trainers and members. Energetic classes, fun workouts. Well equipped. All you need in a gym.",positive
"How's your plan working for you? Your Gym: * Some corporation in another state that's more interested in your direct deposit than your fitness * People who hog 3 machines/benches at one time; ""Dude, I'm super setting!"" * Someone resting for 10 minutes on the equipment you want to use * Broken Equipment for 2+ weeks * People who read magazines/papers on the equipment * People who wear cologne/perfume * The mirror poser * That person who is always talking on their cell phone * That naked dude that's always in the locker room * Those Scottstitutes... * The cast of Jersey Shore and Real Housewives of Scottsdale * The 10lbs (actually 15lbs) that you've tried losing for 2.5 years now As Many Reasons As Possible (AMRAP) to join CrossFit BLUR * Awesome trainers who teach and coach at all levels * Scheduled classes nearly all day long * New routine DAILY, never the same old exercises * Full body workouts; show off your strengths; work on your weaknesses * Average workout time is about 30-40 minutes, but you'll know you worked out! * Awesome members that support, encourage, and celebrate your success * Build real muscle not steroid puffy * Burn fat, lose weight, eat more - look great! * If you decide CrossFit is not for you that's cool; all the things you hated about your old gym will be there when you return",positive
"Been here for almost 6 months now and I love it! I tried several other boxes in the area before finding Blur and I knew by the end of the first week that I'd be staying at this one. The coaches are great people and really knowledgeable. I'm a big stickler about form, so I definitely wanted to be somewhere where the coaches paid attention to technique and safety, and all of them do at Blur. The workouts are definitely challenging, but the coaches are more than willing to scale whatever is needed. Everyone has a lot of fun and are very encouraging of each other. Awesome gym for anyone from a newbie to a seasoned crossfitter.",positive
"I've been here for over 2 years now and decided to update my review to emphasize the aspects of what makes their gym the best for anybody else looking, rather than just tooting my own ""this is my gym, its the best!"" horn. If you're looking for getting into Crossfit or just a fitness plan in general, look no further. The great things this place offers is: - An investment in their members and their gym They constantly put money and effort into providing the gym and its members with new equipment, new setups, supplements, apparel, and cleanliness. They recently took a member survey and genuinely took the input and immediately made some changes to how they run the day to day (all for the better!) - Best scheduling around Every hour, on the hour. First class at 6am, last class at 7pm (they take a lunch break from (11am-1pm). Schedules this flexible and easy to orient and plan around are hard to find. - Straightforward pricing with good intro deal It's on their website. They offer an introductory deal so it's low commitment up front if you want to try it out first. After that, no contract and everything is unlimited use. - Dedicated trainers/owners The owners are the trainers. They're also the best athletes in the gym, which really goes to prove that their programming is effective and efficient. If you follow Crossfit, you can see that the trainers and the gym produces regional level athletes, which is a solid benchmark. - Positive and supportive environment Whether you're looking to be competitive or just in it to be healthier and look better naked, either way you'll find it here. Both the community and the trainers here are supportive of everyone and very fun to be around. Beyond all this, I don't know what else you'd need to look for!",positive
"I looked at a lot of crossfit boxes across the valley. I got the free sessions, and free trials. None of them felt right, either it was too pricey, too limited on classes, or unwelcoming. I finally found Crossfit Blur through word of mouth. I emailed them, and got the tour. I came in and Justin, who gave me the tour, was all smiles. He was patient and friendly, and wasn't pushy. I didn't feel like I was buying a car like at the other boxes. He explained the price, which was among the cheaper prices of the other boxes. There was no contract, and no limit on how many classes you can attend. I worked out there for a week. I got to meet the other owner, Jake, who is also all smiles. Both are very helpful and help make the new experience less intimidating. 4 months later, my girlfriend and I are both members, and I am down 35lbs and in the best shape of my life. Why this gym/box over the others? The owners, the members, and the atmosphere. I feel welcomed, encouraged, and committed. I don't dread waking up and having to workout, I look forward to it.",positive
"Crossfit Blur is an energy filled environment that kicks your booty into gear! When I initially met the trainers, I felt very comfortable and at ease with my fitness goals in their hands. The gym is unlike global gyms. It has a very open concept and simple equipment. They have little challenges within the gym that really motivate you to workout more in order to achieve your personal fitness goals. I have been a member of LA Fitness and used to watch all the muscle heads walk around there. Crossfit Blur peeps are very easy going and everyone is welcoming of new members. We all remember our first day and it's great to see new people come so far doing Crossfit. I highly recommend trying the gym out and bring a friend. I have been a member for 7 months now (they've been open for 9) and am not interested in looking anywhere else. They have free classes on Saturday! Here's their website: http://www.crossfitblur.com/#!home|mainPage Like them on facebook! :)",positive
"I died, came back to life and wanted to do it all over again. And it only took 10 minutes. When I first started with Crossfit Blur I was completely out of shape. As I've gotten older it's something that's increasingly been on my mind and seemingly harder to do. The thing is, I haven't found something that I can really stick with on a long-term basis At CrossFit Blur with zero commitment and a free week to see what all the hype was about, how could I not sign up and give it a shot. The gym itself is a big open concrete room with various weights, ropes, and torture devices ... ahem I mean exercise tools. I was nervous, excited and a bit confused since this was all new to me. I was quickly greeted by Jake who showed me around and introduced me to people stretching or waiting to start their workout. After a quick warm up session he set up a ""nice' workout for me: 500 m row, 40 squats, 30 push ups, 20 sit ups, and 10 jump pulls ups. Sounds easy, right? Well by the end my arms were buckling underneath me, my breathing was strangled and I felt like jumping in the air would literally kill me. But then it was over. I laid on the floor too weak to move except to take a few gulps from my water bottle and day one was over. Six months later I have become a real CrossFit junkie and at this point I can't imagine missing a day. So far I have lost 25 lbs, I am down 4 sizes and have gained endurance, strength, and a family of fellow cross fitters who encourage and really push me to push myself. I'd encourage anyone and everyone to give this a try... the amount of camaraderie and commitment demanded of such a physically grueling program really knocks you out of that boring gym routine and into a world where exercise is exciting. Brutal, but exciting. If you are wanting serious results and ready to change your life CrossFit blur is the place for you.",positive
"BEST GYM EVER. BEST TRAINERS EVER. I have worked out with 5 personal trainers in my life....and these guys are the best. And crossfit workouts are the best workouts out there. I joined because I needed to mix up my routine, get more EFFECTIVE workouts, and not work out with some lame trainer at Mountainside or LA Fitness that just has me do machines while he texts his girlfriend and watches the clock. The trainers at crossfit blur are extremely knowledgeable and actually care about us members .... they are SO nice and give everyone tons of personal attention. I love how they make sure our form is perfect and safe.....that is one of the most important things to me! Crossfit Blur is perfect for people of any fitness level. I am probably the slowest, weakest girl there right now (I am pretty new) but I still LOVE it!! I leave every day feeling like I just had the hardest workout of my life...in a fabulously addicting and good way! Every session is different. I totally look forward to going every day. Worth every penny.",positive
"Shoutout to Kate whose an amazing trainer and knows exactly how to push you to your limits. I've been going a few weeks now and I always try to get my sessions with her. She doesn't baby you, which is good, it's what I pay for. I'm a pretty weak person emotionally and physically and CFC is really helping me change that. The student discount is generous too compared to other gyms.",positive
Great place to drop in when visiting the Toronto Area. Very Friendly staff and coaches. The coaches were very knowledgeable. I was very impressed when they discuss the purpose of the workout and how we could achieve that with modifications and scaling options. Definitely would visit again.,positive
"I joined CFC in Jan 2013. I was scared at first because of all the stories of the workouts I heard from others. A friend and I signed up for the assessment and met Paul the owner and one of the instructors. The space was clean, large with very high ceilings.after the assessment, he showed us a list of prices and told us if we were interested, to drop in any class. No pressure. His classes are from 6am to 7pm- every hour on the hour! Basically, when you arrive you do a set to stretches to warm up . Then each month,there is a different skill to practice. For example this month is kettle bells. Then the evil WOD......At midnight, Paul's ""dog"" Leonidas posts the WOD for the next day. I don't recommend reading it. You may not go. So be surprised! Anyway, he demonstrates each part of the WOD and checks that all participates perform the moves properly. It's either an AMRAP- as many reps as possible or RFT -rounds for time. Paul has a great sense of humor, makes you not intimidated even to ask dumb questions and incorporates safety into the routine. Finally, you write your name on a whiteboard with your time or # of reps. I'm usually the last one but it doesn't matter. Paul encourages individual goals. It's really helped make me stronger. Before leaving, we stretch again!! I also like all the other instructors working there, namely Irena!",positive
"I've been going to Crossfit Colosseum for about 2 years now. I first visited on their 1 year anniversary Friends & Family BBQ. I met a bunch of people who worked out there and spoke enthusiastically about crossfit and its benefits. What struck me was how engaged people were when they spoke about the program and their personal goals. Crossfit at Crossfit Colosseum takes many aspects of your life and rolls it up into a fun lifestyle. They taught me about eating right, and why which food is better for you. I was able to get physical therapy or a sport massage (included in my membership). I was encouraged to take rest days and workout days. And when I workout they push me to my limits, every time. Crossfit isn't a day at the spa - you have to be hungry for it. When you do people around you gravitate toward your goals. Don't be afraid to ask lots of questions. There is too much to know to think you are going to do it all fast. I love that I can get what I need whenever I need it. The trainers are amazing and Paul, the Owner, is in regular attendance and ready to help. Over these 2 years I've lost 10 belt sizes and feel great physically and mentally. Crossfit is a place you can go and forget everything else and just feel the intensity of a fun workout. I'm 42 years old and I never though I'd do things like rope climbing, pull ups, double unders - I didn't think I had it in me. But I chipped away with the guidance of the trainers scaling every workout until I achieved some of my goals. I'm still working at creating and getting goals and I know this process will never end - it's part of what makes going to this gym awesome. I'll tell you what I tell prospective clients that walk through the door looking for information - ""Just try It - it's addictive and you'll love it"". I definitely give Crossfit Colosseum 5 stars.",positive
"I called on a Friday to book an intro appointment on Sunday. When I showed up, nobody had any record of my appointment (great start!). So I guess they scrambled to accomodate me. The owner/coach was obviously incredibly distracted by whatever else was going on in the gym that day- ran me through the broad strokes of crossfit so quickly that he sounded like the Micro Machines guy. Though he took the time to tell me about his half-marathon time and his own fitness achievements, he didn't ask me ONE SINGLE question about my goals, my fitness experience, my motivations or my expectations. I did my baseline workout (which he was only half watching), and when I finished he told me that he thought I had ""a little left in the tank"", and handed me a sheet of paper with their prices (which are not cheap, btw). He told me he'd email me with a breakdown of my baseline workout, and I've yet to receive anything three days later. There's no doubt that they're serious about fitness there, but I didn't get the feeling that they were serious about MY fitness. If this is how they treat a potential client, I don't have high hopes that the treatment will improve once they have my money, so they will not be getting it. I was really excited about trying CrossFit before my session on Sunday, as I had heard so many good things about it from my friends. I left the session feeling as though I had imposed upon the owner's time and trespassed into his club. I'm still motivated to try CrossFit, but I'll be finding somewhere else to invest my time, my sweat and my money. Liked: The facility looked impressive Disliked: The dismissive treatment I received",negative
"Crossfit is a bit of a cult, but a good cult. For those who haven't tried it, crossfit is a very high intensity form of workout where people work out with a mixture of weights and cardio in a group setting. There a number of crossfit gyms in Toronto. I have tried two of them, and, for me, this is the best. As I said, this gym can seem a bit cultish at first. However, there is a real sense of community here, and people are friendly, so if it is a cult, at least the people are nice. For people used to a conventional gym, this can seem a bit offputing: who are these people and why are they talking to me? Although it seems a little strange at first, it is worth a try if you live in the area, are hoping to try something different and meet some new people.",positive
"I was a regular here for nearly 2 years before moving overseas. I was new to crossfit before coming, but have tried many other forms of exercise, like boxing, weights, cycling, sports teams, etc. The style of workout a Quantum is a nice mix of typical weights, with the punishing (but mercifully short) Workout of the Day. From my understanding of other gyms I'd say this is more of a ""sport"" crossfit gym than a ""pure"" or traditional one. Less emphasis on dangerous lifts with heavy weight, but rather a focus on using your body weight and moving with correct form. It has a very social atmosphere and is very inclusive. Simple decore in a rather drab area, but easy to drive to and lots of free parking. Bottom line is that you have way more motivation to attend, you work harder, and you have more fun than any other fitness routine I've tried. Highly recommended.",positive
"Would recommend to anyone regardless of fitness level or experience. I stared coming here 3 years ago with absolutely no past sports or gym/weights experience of any kind. The trainers were amazing at teaching me the proper lifting skills at low weights (empty bar even) to make sure I would learn proper technique first before even thinking about adding weight. There is no ego here, or pressure to do weights or workouts before you are ready for them, from either the coaches or other gym members. Everyone is very friendly and supportive and you will see a big range of fitness levels working out side by side and never feel intimidated or embarrassed. The only person I've ever competed with is myself, just working to improve myself every time. I'm the fittest and healthiest I've been in my life and wouldn't consider going anywhere else other than Quantum.",positive
"Whether you've tried Crossfit before and are looking for a new box or you're new to the sport, you should definitely give this ""box"" a try. I've been to several in the city and within North America and these guys really have a good thing going. Crossfit has gained a lot of popularity & attention over the last few years. It's an intense and amazing sport combining gymnastics, powerlifting and well, just about anything goes which is why I love it. It's a sport, that if not done correctly, you can injure yourself...like anything else. Now that's where Quantum Crossfit really sets itself apart from the pack. Their programs are specific, their coaches pay very close attention to the detail & quality of what you're doing and they can tailor anything you need depending on your performance level, whether you have an injury, etc. The one on one coaching is second to none. Their coaches are not only well versed in Crossfit specifics but they also know their olympic lifting techniques. What I really appreciated when I first started over a year ago was my first couple of visits were free - to see how I liked the place & for the coaches to have a chance to evaluate my fitness level in order to ensure I had the fundamentals down before getting into the more technical stuff. It is a small facility but I think that's what makes it so brilliant. You really do get a chance to connect with other people and the sense of community is fantastic. Crossfit is really all about community so you'll want to pick a place where you feel comfortable. For me, that's Quantum Crossfit.",positive
"Look elsewhere. Quantum cancelled my class two hours before I was scheduled to arrive. If I hadn't contacted them, they wouldn't have even told me. If you call them, they never pick up. Their ""trainers"" literally don't know how to use email. There are many worthwhile CrossFit facilities in the west end of the city. I suggest you look there. Also, this review is coming from an actual person who was interested in CrossFit -- not by one of their trainers who write very long and very glowing reviews. Read the lengthy reviews with a grain of salt. Question who wrote them in the first place. Good luck finding a facility that can help you reach your fitness goals.",negative
"This was the second box i checked out in search of the ""one"" for me. I forget his name but the young man that was the trainer when i went in was awesome. Very attentive, scaled the WOD, knowledgable and super friendly. group seemed a bit snarky (had a few women raise eyebrows etc when my tiny 2 year veteren CF-er sister said she didn't need a band for pullups) but overall, it was an enjoyable experience. location was an issue for me, which was why I decided to keep looking :T I would reccomend this box to anyone who didn't fid the location to be an issue :)",positive
"Firstly, Crossfit rocks. A fitness routine that incorporates a dynamic range of movements from burpees to pull ups to olympic weightlifting movements to sprinting. It pretty much encapsulates various aspects of fitness and tightly packs it into 1 hr classes. If you're really looking to jump start your health, physique and overall athletic ability, you should look no further than Crossfit. Hmm I sound a little brainwashed don't I? Well try it and you'll get brainwashed too. Just to let you a bit of my background pertaining to this, fitness is an important part of my life. I make it mandatory to exercise frequently and a lot of my extra curricular activities are physical (volleyball, dragon boat, adventure racing). I've gone through a whole 90 days with P90X and saw some decent results but I want to push it further and Crossfit seemed like a perfect fit. Location: What attracted me most was the location of this gym. Most of the crossfit gyms are downtown but this one is the only one I've found that is more uptown. That alone, makes this gym a solid choice for those looking to try it out but don't live downtown Facilities: Like most Crossfit gyms, the main elements required empty spaces with pull up bars on the wall, rings hanging from the ceiling, olympic barbells/dumbells, and medicine balls. This gym is not fully equipped like a Goodlife with elliptical machines or exercise machines because that's not really what the sport entails. There is one washroom (no shower) and individual change room that are very well maintained. Overall, the gym is very clean despite having that garage gym feel which is super cool. You can tell how much a gym owner cares by how well they maintain the facilities and it's pristine(Yes, as a Crossfit tradition, you're supposed to collapse to the floor after workout and this floor is very clean). It's a bit small in comparison to the likes of CrossfitTO, but is okay for the average class size (5-8). Classes/Membership: This gym runs on the instructional class methodology with room for specialized programs once you've become familiar with proper form. Like any sport, there are skills that need to be taught properly to avoid injury and ensure proper muscle development. I can't count the number of times I've seen people in the gym lifting big weights but with really bad form. Sure, it's an ego thing and I was like that too but no more. Having instructional classes allow for injury prevention and proper muscle development. As classes are typically not that large (5-8 people per hour), the trainer is able to assist everyone. Classes usually are composed of a strength development component and a metabolic conditioning part (more cardio-esque but with weights sometimes) and last about an hour.(no more of that 2.5 hours at the gym nonsense) Everyone tries to motivate each other during the workouts and the trainers are always being vocal and pushing you along. These classes are ideal for those who don't have much time for the gym but want a workout that is short but high intensity. Trust me, you don't want to work out anymore after just 1 hr here...unless you're crazy. Trainers: Couldn't ask for better bunch of people. They pay attention to your specific needs and suggest things. They scale/modify workouts to your own abilities. They provide you with nutritional advice. They are constantly taking courses to better their understanding of fitness and mobility. They definitely challenge you but don't make you feel like you don't belong. The culture fostered in this gym is definitely one where you can make friends and have social gatherings if you feel so inclined. Overall: Just a great facility overall. As I'll update with a link in the future, this gym was voted best fitness gym in Toronto by the NOW magazine readers! Will post link when available. That alone is a statement in itself. Please don't be hesitant to try it out because you think you're not fit enough. Like I said before, the trainers pay specific attention to everyone and will appropriate workouts according to your own abilities so that you still feel challenged but not pushed over the edge. You have to start somewhere and when you do, this gym will help you see improvements like you've never imagined.",positive
This is a great gym with friendly coaches and members. The workouts are challenging but fun and everyone is very supportive of each other. The facilities and equipment are also excellent. I'd highly recommend this gym. You will feel at home here.,positive
"Been CrossFitting for three years. Finally decided to take the plunge and drop-in to a gym for a workout, while in the road. Was able to get two WODs in the week that I was there. The facility was too notch, the members were welcoming and I found the coaches (Aaron & Billy) to be friendly, knowledgeable and very engaging. All the above made for an exceptional experience. This will definitely not be my last visit. If you find yourself in Madison and in need a place to throw down, I would definitely recommend CrossFit Recursive!",positive
"In town for Epic conference and was happy to find CF Recursive just a mile from my hotel. Nicole was incredibly responsive to email inquires and they make it EASY to register for classes. Classes span from 530am all the way through 830pm so you can make it work. Coaches were fabulous with a lot of explanation, a significant time for mobility, and workouts were challenging. Members made me feel at home welcoming me from the second I walked in the door. Will definitely be back next time I'm in town for Epic. Thanks CF Recursive for welcoming me!",positive
"I walked in here two years ago - a woman in my 40s who had never tried CrossFit or even had a gym membership before - and immediately felt welcomed. I keep coming back because each time is a challenge, but with constant variety so I never get bored like I used to with my cardio-focused walking/biking/running. I love how I'm always meeting new people here, and at the same time can look forward to seeing my regular morning workout buddies when I come in. All of the coaches have taught me so much - like I never would have tried Olympic lifts on my own (and shouldn't!), but with their patient instruction and personalized feedback - even within group sessions - I've actually started to be able to handle some heavier-for-me weights. I've finally increased my upper body strength to where I can now have fun with body weight movements that were an utter chore before (I no longer need to swear under my breath to get through push-ups! I can do rope climbs!). And what's also crucial is that when I'm not feeling 100%, or a movement is just beyond me, it has always been okay to scale back and modify as necessary, or do a lighter weight for that day, and the coaches always respect that and have great advice for how to approach scaling.",positive
"Great crossfit gym in Madison! I dropped in for a free trial class and it was great. The building is very nice and well-kept. High ceilings and plenty of rig space for pull-up and other forms of torture ;). The trainers were great. Vivian lead my class and was super helpful. The programming of the class I attended was very well-rounded with lifting and met-con plus mobility work. The location is great too, within walking distance of the Capitol building downtown. Lots of restaurants nearby too in case you want to earn some dinner during the WOD.",positive
"These guys are GREAT! Just started Crossfit this week because a group of co-workers of mine swear by it. I can see why they love it! After just THREE one hour classes I feel better/tighter/more energized. My co-workers and I took class with both Nikole and Dirk and they were both excellent! Being that I am a complete newbie to Crossfit they took extra time to explain terminology and how to safely execute every exercise. I was afraid of Crossfit before now but I can hardly wait to take my next class! It IS challenging but I feel results already!! Crossfit combined with a better diet are bound to get me where I want to be with my personal physical fitness goals. I'm a big guy (6 foot 4, 260 lbs) and I managed to survive class! My ultimate goal is to tone back up and trim back down to about 220...I'm confident the combination of exercises & cardio/weight training done in Crossfit will get me there. Oh - and I am a HUGE dog lover...it was so much fun having a huge, beautiful, sweet dog greet me when I first walked into the studio! Madison is lucky to have this studio here.",positive
"Nikole and Dirk run a fantastic CrossFit gym. It's fun, supportive of whatever your goal is, and it will kick your butt. They have a ton of room to work out, lots of new equipment, and they're just steps from the Capital City Trail.",positive
"I originally went to Crossfit Recursive to get into better shape for my wedding and stayed because of the incredible community that Dirk and Nikole built. When I started I wasn't very strong and had very little knowledge about the movements; however, that didn't matter. The coaches worked with me to make sure that I learned the important points of each lift while also emphasizing the safest way to do it. Not only is there a good focus on the correct technique, but there is a always a section of mobility work to help prepare your body for the type of workout you'll be doing that day which further reduces risk of injury. The value placed on safety makes me feel like they truly care for the well-being of their members. On top of all that, I've achieved my goals and have set more that I didn't think I would ever be capable of thanks to the Crossfit Recursive. There are other boxes that are closer to where I live but I prefer to drive to this one--it's a great gym with awesome members and I highly recommend it.!",positive
"I dropped in at CrossFit Recursive in May 2014, and was coached by Dirk. I was excited for the workout, which involved tire flips, as my home gym doesn't have the outdoor space for them. Dirk was friendly and helpful, as were several other members who went out of their way to introduce themselves. From my brief visit, I got the impression that the community at this gym is tight-knit and a lot of fun.",positive
"Easily the best box in the downtown / east side area. The community is very welcoming and the coaching is fantastic. All skill levels are fully represented with a plethora of class options. From running to traditional crossfit to boot camp to oly training, Sixth City does it all. Adam, CSCs head coach, has a very strong ability to make individual connections with members, even in large class scenarios. He has single handedly raised and pushed me to become a better athlete, worker, and overall person, as well as many others. Without a good coach and gym, Crossfit is just word. Sixth City brings everything together in full circle.",positive
"As a runner, I've always been intimidated by CrossFit but knew it was something I needed. I really appreciate the kindness and patience the coaches have shown me while I learn all of the ins and outs of all the workouts and movements. I haven't been this sore in a LONG time. I am getting stronger, more confident, and more fit with each workout.",positive
"My husband and I dropped in during a weekend trip to Cleveland. We attended the CityFit class, which was crossfit-esque but without a barbell and more focused on endurance. We loved it and got a great workout! We emailed in advance about dropping in and received a very fast response, which hasn't always been my experience when emailing CF gyms. The gym is nice and big and also super clean! I'd definitely drop in again if we're in town.",positive
"I joined CSC about a year ago. Because of my job, I never got a chance to consistently workout. Sometimes it would be weeks before I drop back into the box. Despite that, I saw good results over the year with a couple of PRs along the way. I worked with the Coaches Jeff, Adam, and sometimes Megan. They were all awesome and attentive! The coaches are always giving me pointers, pushing me for better form and strength, and certainly welcomed my questions. I certainly feel that I have improved in my techniques over the year despite my sporadic visits! Their hours are great too. When I moved to Cleveland, I looked through many of the boxes' schedules and CSC was the one with the latest/earliest classes. Program wise, we had a good range of cardio and strength building. They started an endurance class too but I never got to participate in that. Overall, I think this gym would be a great place for anyone interested in crossfit, newbies or veterans. While Many of the members seems to have done crossfit for some time, the atmosphere and environment are not intimidating for someone new to it. Each time I go, I leave as if my entire being has been broken down and reconstructed into something better. It's my therapy session. Amusing fact: you can also occasional get a whiff of the coffee being roasted from the company next door.",positive
"I started CrossFit almost 4 years ago. I have been members of numerous gyms within the Cleveland area and CSC is the best box in Cleveland. CSC has some of the best coaching around. Every class starts with a warm-up that includes intentional stretches to focus on the main muscles that will be utilized later in the WOD. Not all gyms do a great job of warming-up their athletes, but CSC places a lot of time on proper warm-ups and cool downs. From their programming, to excellent coaching, to their welcoming community, CSC has it all. Beautiful and large facility right in the heart of downtown Cleveland. If you are looking for a new ""home"" gym in Cleveland or looking for a great place to drop-in while out-of-town, CrossFit Sixth City is your place!",positive
"I've visited many, many CrossFit affiliates throughout the country as a drop-in visitor. CrossFit Sixth City was certainly the most welcoming and accommodating I've been to. The workout was fun too. Definitely stop by if you're in Cleveland.",positive
"I moved to Cleveland last year. I look for others gyms but Crossfit sixth city was the one I choose as my new ""home"". Didn't notice but has been more than 4 months I started. Coach Adam and Jeff know what they are talking about, every time you have a question they are ready to answer and help. They can scaled the word or just change the exercise that's right for you. For sure I recommend for everybody! Even my husband started Crossfit here!",positive
"I'm in town for work for two weeks and I'm not even a week into my drop-in, but I couldn't wait any longer to share how great a box this is! Leading up to my arrival in Cleveland, Adam was always quick to respond to my emails (both about CrossFit but also on his recs on a deep tissue massage therapist in the area, etc.) I've had both Jeff and Adam as coaches and they are both wonderful. Attention to detail, helpful cues that really made sense to me, and good advice about both scaling and mobility. If I were a local to Cleveland, this would absolutely be my home box. And aside from the welcoming members and coaches, they have a clean, large facility complete with all the CrossFit staples (wall balls, barbells, kbs, dumbbells, plenty of rig space, rowers, airdyne, tons of mobility equipment, bands, towels) and if I've missed something, it's because they have everything and then more--even an inversion table! Ha. Definitely go here. The area is fine. I'm a white female wearing Lululemon and I don't feel in danger when walking to and from downtown. But even so, Jeff suggested I cut over to Superior to walk and avoid any seediness, which was nice of him. Ok. I've raved all over the place now. Get thee to CrossFit Sixth City!",positive
"Awesome box, old school CrossFit! Great coaching and community. Did a really fun WOD and got my ass kicked by Liz, totally jacked. Can't wait to go back.",positive
"I travel a lot for work and am always dropping in various gyms across the country. Sixth City is, by far, the best. The trainers know what they're doing. They tailor their coaching to each individual athlete. They care about everyone improving - from the best athlete to the newest member. When I travel it always opens my eyes to how great the members and coaching is at Sixth City.",positive
"SUMMARY: I've been doing CrossFit for a while and I have to say that I LOVE this box as an ATHLETE, a WOMAN, and most importantly, as a CUSTOMER. Personally, I feel safe, I find the trainers to be friendly and engaging, and I experience a great deal of personal growth at this CrossFit box. LOCATION: I've not once felt unsafe or that my personal property is at risk. Cars get broken into all over this city--it's a fact of life out here. I've seen break-ins happen in decent looking Cleveland neighborhoods, I've seen it happen a couple blocks up at CrossFit CLE, I've seen it happen on weekend nights in the warehouse district, and I've seen it happen out in Cleveland Heights and Lakewood. That doesn't mean we're not safe. It means lock your doors and don't leave tempting things out in the open for criminals to see. Not just at this location, but everywhere you go in the city. And if something happens, make sure you tell the business owner right away. Even so, I've never had my car broken into and I've been here since the day this box opened its doors (I never had a problem when I was a member at CLE up the street either). I'm here five to six days a week at various hours and I've never once had a problem with my car or the surrounding public. Actually, the people I've encountered on the street are all quite nice and some even cheer us on when we're outside running. HOURS: The hours are great. Many CrossFit boxes in the Cleveland metro area do not have these kind of hours. I'm able to get a workout in any day of the week regardless of my schedule. I especially like that Sundays are essentially free. TRAINERS: The trainers here are great. They are super friendly, hands-on, and engaged in every class I attend. They always help me when I have questions. Actually, they even help me when I don't have questions. This crew watches us closely and makes sure we're doing things safe and correctly. They also do a great job and finding weak spots in form and help me fix problems. And when I feel like I need some extra training, they have no problem programming additional work that day for me without any extra cost. I especially love that, on days where I'm not feeling ready to attack a workout full force, they don't let anyone hide in the corner. They make sure everyone is doing their best work each and every time. I love these trainers! PROGRAMMING: I like the change of pace I get through the programming at this box. You get your full hours' worth, that's for sure. We generally run through a strength or Olympic lifting session, then we work on accessory movements that help us further improve strength and skills, then we do a WOD. A couple days a week we only focus on longer WODs. I've seen major improvements over the past six months of this programming. I'm hitting personal records all the time thanks to this programming. EXTRAS: Once a week a chiropractor/massage therapist drops by to help with the aches and pains a serious athlete might encounter for $20 a session. On Sundays, the gym provides $5 yoga. A yoga instructor comes in and we all get a great hour-long yoga session. The gym also runs beach workouts and various activities out in the city as a great way to experience CrossFit in a different setting. COST: CrossFit isn't cheap, but that's because you receive hands-on training and programming meant to help you see real gains and achieve goals. Other gyms might might be cheaper, but if you're not actually seeing any OTHER: I'm a woman and I lift weights via CrossFit. I lift heavy weights. I didn't get huge muscles nor do I look like a man. Women, I urge you to come to this gym and lift heavy weights and get stronger. You won't get huge/big. You'll get strong and tone. You'll lose body fat and belly flab. You'll have good lean muscle that allow you to eat all the fun foods without gaining fatty weight. Lifting weights won't make you some massive man-looking lunk. It takes a ton of work to reach those bodybuilder levels. What we do here will make you feel good and look good!",positive
"I have been doing CrossFit for 3 years and have been to many of the local CLE gyms and a few around the country and CrossFit Sixth City has 3 of the best trainers (1 female and 2 males) around. They are very knowledgeable and go out of their way to teach all the movements and make sure everyone has good form and technique. Great gym for non-CrossFitters and CrossFitters of all levels. The members are all very welcoming and it's a great, fun group of business professionals of all ages. It is one of the bigger gyms in the area with pleanty of room and equipment even w a larger class. Multiple bathrooms and showers and it is about 30 seconds off the freeway exit.",positive
"I started doing CrossFit three years ago. It's been great. While this is a new gym, the trainers are all quite experienced. And it's more than just a CrossFit gym. There's an Olympic lifting program too. If you want CrossFit, they got it. If you want an Oly or strength program, they got it. What I especially like about this CrossFit program is that they do more than just the regular workout of the day. There's a big focus on other exercises and movements that ultimately help me get stronger and more capable when handling the workouts. In the end, my favorite thing about CrossFit is that it forces me to focus on what my body can do, not what my body looks like. By changing the focus, I'm reaping the benefits in appearance, for sure. CrossFit is the only workout program that's actually done something for me. I see real gains both in my strength and endurance, and in how I look and feel. It's also enabled me to be more focused on setting and achieving goals. I love this gym and I would recommend it to anyone, regardless of their ability. Shoot, when I started CrossFit, I was heavier and I couldn't do much at all in terms of fitness. This place is awesome!",positive
"I started CrossFit 2 years ago. From being a couch potato to working out 3-4 times per week, it's been a big change. It has made a positive difference in my lifestyle, eat healthy, work out regularly. No work out is easy, everyday you leave with your butt being kicked and realizing how much more there is to achieve. The facility is excellent, coaches are well versed in CrossFit. The emphasis is on ensuring you do it right. The programming led by Jeff, Adam & Katie is adaptive and helps address your shortcomings. So if you want to get fit, improve your strength & conditioning - CrossFit Sixth City is the place to be at. I endorse CSC without any reservations. Addendum: 6/14 CSC has added weekly yoga classes. These are held every Thursday, led by a certified yoga instructor. I find them very complimentary to CrossFit especially with mobility. The yoga classes are open to all & cost $5/session.",positive
"Watch out, members. Crunch just charged my bank 19.95 instead of the 9.95 I have been paying for years. No permission to do it. Notice was posted in the gym!!! I have to sign to get it switched back but they didn't have to get a signature to charge more? Check your statements!",negative
"My only wish would be for another squat rack (they only have one so if someone's on it, you'll end up waiting forever) and better Wi-Fi. Other than that, I love my gym. They have a good selection of machines and multiple sets of free weights around the gym. It's clean and the staff members are friendly.",positive
"Can only speak for the lunch-time/mid-day crowd, but it's definitely a great value for what you pay. Staff is friendly (so much so that it's clearly a ""rule"" that they acknowledge when you enter/leave), there's always people cleaning, and the equipment is generally in working order. It's small, so sometimes it can be a struggle to get the squat rack or to do bench presses, but that can be said of almost any gym. Lots of reviews on here are of the people -- and that's not something the gym can really control. Yes, there's some interesting characters at a $10/mo gym in the Waterfront, but that doesn't reflect on the facility in any way. I will say there's some questions about some of the gym ""rules."" Lots of signs up about no deadlifts if not done on squat rack or smith, but no one seems to enforce it. There have also been many occasions where the shows don't have soap in the dispensers - bring your own, I get it, but it's still an annoyance that's easily fixable",positive
"I love Crunch because it offers me plenty of choices---from free weights to machines to exercise classes all for $25/month. This gym is like a melting pot which is my favorite thing about it; you'll find young, older, beginners, experienced, and so much more here. Plus it's conveniently located in the Waterfront so it's easy to tack on a shopping or grocery trip before or after hitting the gym.",positive
"I've been to LA fitness, I was a member at Planet Fitness and they were okay, but I'm glad I finally joined Crunch. First off, what really made me join is the location. The location is so convenient located right in the Waterfront(homestead). I really enjoy coming to Crunch, I like the atmosphere of the gym and there are tons of machines to choose from. It's never where I'm waiting around for a machine I want to do. I don't feel judged using this gym and that was a big factor for me. Most of the staff is friendly, but some of the staff aren't at all. They are a little standoffish. The manager is super friendly and is who signed me up for my membership. She gave me a ton of guest passes to give to friends/family that wanted to try the gym out. They have 2 or 3 tanning beds and a hydromassage table. There are 3 different types of memberships you can sign up for starting at $10 and goes up to $30. There is a yearly maintenance fee but it still is a great price for a gym membership. They have group classes that you can join in on but that is if you're a second tier membership. Overall, Crunch is a great gym and I recommend it to everyone!",positive
"Crunch fitness at the water front is the worst gym I've ever been to.The staff and manly manager are the worst.They used to have a great staff and I loved comming there but now it's all new staff and they are terrible.The other day I was not allowed to tan unless I bought a pair of eye were from them.""WOW"" in the years I've been going there this is the first time I have ever heard that role.",negative
My entire life i have been very attractive. So when i went to work out in front of a mirror and grunt loudly while i do it i want to see hot girls in yoga pants watch me in amazment. This was not that kind of gym. And ill explain it all from the beginning. I start my rountine buy chugging a monster and redlining my moms honda accord to get the juices flowing. When i walked in this place i was amazed to not see any other fellow brosefs. Which i dont mind more gym women for me. The lady at the counter looked more like a librarian than a gym lady. Strike one. I normally start with my pecks than abs then chest again and i need 3 machines at once because i crossfit. Some little skinny kid tried telling me that i cant sit on my phone and upload pics of me shredding to instagram and not use the machines (little guy doesnt even know crossfit). Boy was i not in the mood i told that preteen to eat more protein so that my knuckles wont bleed when i pound his face in. He ran like the girl that i called fat in high school. Puny punk boy strike two. My brah chad called me and asked me what i was doing. I told my brah to come spot me lifting. So chad came in but because he wasnt a member he wasnt allowed in. I tried to explain to the librarian that my brah is just gunna spot me. She told me to leave because im sure she was jelly of my abs and because i called her a landwhale. Brah thats strike three. I took all my sweat and rubbed in on the all the equipment and went in the bathroom and left an upper decker. Last time i go there 1 star,negative
"I love this gym! It's usually never packed and always has the tanning beds open. The one thing I don't really understand is I've been tanning there since I got my membership last year, tonight was the first night an employee asked me about wearing goggles in the bed. I've been tanning here for at least 12 months or more, and I've never been asked that before. She made me pay for eye shields that I don't use or I wouldn't have been able to go in the bed. I just think if that's a rule they should really address it to the other employees that let me go without goggles all the rest of the times I've been here. Other than that it's a pretty nice gym.",negative
"I've been a member since this Crunch location opened last year. It's fine for cardio and lifting, and I've never had to wait for a machine. I only give it 3 stars because of the lack of class selection (bring back evening Barre or early AM yoga, please!) But for $10 a month, I'm keeping my membership.",negative
"You get what you pay for!! Very cheap, no towels, and staff isn't on top of cleanliness or what is happening in locker rooms. No hot water in women's locker room for months. Doesn't compare to the Crunch fitness in NYC or Florida. Classes are very mediocre. Owner doesn't care about members...lives out of state. Not a WOW at all.",negative
"This gym is perfect for those who are intimidated by larger gyms, which are typically busier. You never have to wait to use a machine, and the staff at the front are always very friendly. It's also totally new, which makes it seem much cleaner than other gyms.",positive
"I find this gym meets all my needs, but I don't think it has a WOW factor. I gave it an extra star for classes and low price. It's smaller than other gyms and I don't particularly like the layout of it with the classes right in the front with a glass sliding garage-type door. That's just a preference thing and not really a horrible thing on their part. They do have a variety of classes and enough options for the person who is mostly available to attend in the evenings. TRX classes and availability of kettlebells are a plus for me. Their women's locker room is a good size and has counter space to get ready after a shower. I wish the showers had a bit more privacy to be able to change/get dressed right there after a shower versus out in the open. Again, a preference thing. I like how they have a filtered water fountain right outside of the lockers where you can fill up your water bottle. Convenient and easy. I haven't had a run-in with any of their staff (like trainers) outside of the front desk individuals who have always been friendly to me. Some of the instructors for the classes aren't my favorite in how they conduct their class, but I just try different classes if I don't like an instructor. I will continue to go here out of convenience and price!",positive
"I like Crunch... I've been a member for over three months now. While this was not a prime location for me... It's a bit out of my way. I was looking for 3 things 1 exercise classes, 2 more diverse workout equipment and 3 low price. I signed up after opening specials but before the last deals closed. So I get classes and a base membership for 10$ per month. And roughly 39.99$ in yearly dues for value that really cannot be beat. My old gym didn't offer classes, was over crowded and had some pretty banged up equipment for that same price. I have never had any issues with the front desk staff or class instructors everyone is nice and friendly. It's a pretty clean gym, modern new equipment and holy kettle-bells batman! I was so happy to be able to include a routine with yoga balls, medicine balls and kettle bells. In short equipment wise there is something for everyone here. I do wish there was a bit more space, but you can use the class room when classes are not running for workouts and stretching you just cannot bring outside equipment from elsewhere in the gym into that room. A little sad but there are bosu balls yoga mats, small free weights and trx straps in there. The classes and instructors vary in my opinion, the Zumba is very popular and belly butt and thighs boot camp, are tough, so is bosu boot camp. I really like the trx class, yoga is so so. I have tried going different times as there are instructors I prefer that will vary based on your tastes. I have never had a problem with overcrowding here. Lots of different types of people working out here also. I was hesitant about this gym due some mixed reviews but after diving into my membership I have no concerns.",positive
"Of you are used to the crunches in NYC, prepare to be disappointed. Small comparatively and limited services- showers but they don't even offer towels. Strength section section very minimal, no wifi, outdated cardio machines that don't work well. I sure hope this gym doesn't cost as much as joining crunch in NYC- not worth more than 30$/month.",negative
"Clearly... A gym is necessary for all of my restaurant ventures... LOL. I am so glad I became a member. I became a member during their grand opening, so I received my ""Peak"" membership for $20 per month. The basic package was offered for $10. The peak includes classes, hydro-massage spa, and tanning (I don't need it, but its nice to know it is there). The staff and trainers are very nice, and willing to offer a helping hand when needed. They offer personal training, supplements/shakes, and other very cool perks. The space is very clean, and I see the staff cleaning the machines often. The gym has all of the amenities for the average gym heads!",positive
"When I discovered that Crunch gym was about to open in the Waterfront, I immediately signed up for a membership and cancelled my membership at Planet Fitness. Crunch is much closer to where I live which is a big deal since I don't like to spend a lot of time driving just to go to the gym. Initially I thought Crunch would comprise of the bottom and top floors of the old Filenes Basement. However, Crunch is on the top floor and a men's clothing store will be on the bottom floor. The gym is actually smaller than other gyms I've been to but it is still spacious and even has a large fitness studio for the various classes that are offered such as Pilates and Zumba. The women's locker room is nice. It has a grey and purple color scheme going on. There are plenty of lockers, a scale, five bathroom stalls, three showers and an area where there are sinks as well as an extra counter to do your hair and make up. There are no paper towels, only two hand dryers. The only thing I don't like about the locker room is that there are no changing stalls. There are plenty of options available to have a fun and effective workout. If you are a cardio queen or king, there are an estimated 30 treadmills, around a dozen or more elliptical machines, and a handful of stairstep machines. The weightlifting area is my favorite. There are plenty of free weights and weight machines (plate and pin) to tone or build up your muscles. If you prefer to stretch before you work out, there is an area in the front of the facility that provides mats. Also in that same area are kettle bells and exercise balls. Fitness classes are also offered at Crunch. I haven't participated in one yet but Retro-tonics sounds fun. To see what classes are being offered and at what time, you can visit Crunch's website. I have the Peak membership that permits me access to the hydro-massage bed and tanning booths. After my workout I absolutely have to go on the hydro-massage bed. O. M. G. This massage bed is AWESOME! It's like having a hundred hot tub jet streams massaging your body! You can program the hydro-massage bed to give you a full body massage or to just massage specific areas. The massage lasts for ten minutes. If you decide to use it during peak hours you will have to wait a while as it's quite popular. There are two tanning booths if you prefer to tan instead of waiting for the hydro-massage bed. Crunch Gym is clean and new and the staff is pleasant. There is a diverse group of people who utilize Crunch, which I really like! Gym membership is also affordable at $10 for a Base membership and $20 for Peak. So far I love working out here!",positive
"This gym just opened last week in the waterfront area in Homestead PA. Membership signup: My wife and I signed up some time ago before they opened so I assume we got the best deal they'll have. The deal was pretty straight forward. $10 and a $30 once a year fee. If you've ever been a planet fitness member you'll recognize the fee structure. The manager whom we signed up with was pleasent and personable. I lost my little key tag thing between the time I signed up in January and when they opened. They kindly replaced this at no charge. All in all signup was a 5/5. How would I describe this place? It is a hybrid of a gym like Planet fitness with lower prices and ""no judgement"" slogans and a more mainstream gym like LA fitness as they do have some classes and proper weights but not spinning, sauna or a pool. Sadly, this is not a 24 hour gym. Which would make it perfect for me. The facility: The facility used to be the top floor of a store I never went into but underwent a complete remodel. It's all new so what can I say other then the space is as good as it will ever be. It is clean and I did see a few staff doing their best to keep it that way already by cleaning. A good sign. The fitness studio for classes is a good sized room. There is an area with kettlebells and weighted balls, an area with cardio machines and the weights area. Also I think there is some tanning and some hydrotherapy thing. I don't know about that stuff as I will never use it. The changing rooms are nice and roomy. No paper towels so slobs will have to try harder to make a mess. Good idea Crunch people. All in all 5/5 The equipment: Everything is brand new and works as it should. I did find one treadmill out of level, which if you are walking is no biggie but if you are running it can get pretty annoying. There are no TV's on the cardio equipment, they're handing from the ceiling. They do have a really good mix if stuff. A couple rowers, lots of threadmills, those forever stair things that are great along with elliptical etc. All in all not bad. The weights area looks like they opened a catalog and just ordered one of everything and a few spare flat benches. Really this is not a bad strategy at all. The only thing missing is a on old school straight bar pull up bar.bolted to the wall. Why gyms refuse to install this $40 piece of equipment I will never get. Good variety of weights with dumbells up to 90lbs. No signs reminding people to rerack their weights. 4.5/5 Unlevel treadmill on day three of business gets them a minor ding. The staff: The staff I have met have so far been personable and accommodating. I asked for a Pilates ball, they showed me where they keep them. I asked that they turn on closed caption on the tv's, they did so. No muss, no fuss so far. Also, there isn't at least so far any pushy personal training pitch. Really this is a wonder and I hope they keep this up. I don't need it and not being upsold constantly would be a real plus. So far so good. Staff gets a 5/5 Classes: I'll try one when they get a schedule setup. So far Not applicable The other patrons: So far it seems about like a nice mix of just regular folks. It has not been too crowded but I have gone at off peak times. As i go back will update my review. The verdict: For $150 a year if they can keep it clean, the equipment/space from getting to beat up I'd say this place will make a welcomed addition to the area. Only time will tell.",positive
"I have been going here for about 10 months now and it's great. The coaches are knowledgeable and very supportive. Equipment is all up to date. It's far more expensive than a regular gym but we'll worth it to have workouts programmed for you and caring coaches to make sure you are doing the movements right and scaling things to your appropriate level so you are not injured and can get the most out of your workout. The members are also very friendly and supportive, and they sometimes host workshops on a variety of fitness related topics that I have also found very helpful.",positive
Dropped in for a couple sessions while in town on business. Great box. Great instruction and I really enjoyed it. I try to Cleveland often and will make this box my regular stop to stay in shape when traveling.,positive
"Great coaches and solid programming. They're always looking for ways to offer programs that suit the needs of their athletes. Ctown is the place to go, if you're looking to ditch your boring routine. Your mindset will change entirely. I walked in worrying about my physique and now all I care about is getting stronger every single day. It's not a bro fest though, there's people every shape and size. The community is great.",positive
"This review is long overdue. I recently moved to and them from Cleveland, spending only nine months in the city. The decision to join Ctown was the best thing to happen to me in my time there. I had not done crossfit before and had been a lifelong in and out of the gym kind of guy. Never fully committing for longer than a few months at a time. From the minute I walked in and met Larry the owner, I knew my life was about to change. Ctown focuses on form first and foremost and under the leadership of head coach R.E. has built a solid reputation and family like atmosphere that was more welcoming than I could ever imagine. The group sizes varied, but even at its largest of 15 you still got individualized attention from the coaches throughout the workout. Being new, I was worried about not being able to keep up with the workouts, but scalability is also important to Ctown. The coaches offered modifications for almost every workout, still pushing you to try and complete it as prescribed. I was only there for a few months, but got into the best shape of my life and was driven by not only the coaches, but my fellow athletes. Yes, you do truly feel like an athlete, no matter how you look. There's no egos at Ctown, everyone is in it together and you build a great comradery that is driven by the caring personalities of the coaches who drive and inspire you as you go. I met lifelong friends in only a few months, got into the best shape of my life and never felt like I was part of a ""cult"" like atmosphere like some skeptics of crossfit would say. I owe R.E., Larry and the team at Ctown much gratitude for taking in a new kid in town and turning out a dedicated, more motivated and better individual in the end. If you are thinking of starting crossfit or looking for a new box to join, I could not recommend a better place and better people to be with. Whether downtown or in Fairview Park, Ctown is the best in Cleveland hands down.",positive
"I started Crossfit at Ctown West about 9 months ago and it has changed my life in a positive way. I had previously spent the 8 years prior going to a typical fitness gym for strength training and cardio. It eventually became repetitive and mundane, causing me to lose interest. I needed something more challenging and exciting, so I decided to try Crossfit. The folks at Ctown were immediately helpful in not only explaining Crossfit, but also explaining how their club operates. When I signed up, I was welcomed in by all of the coaches as well as the Crossfitters. After the initial phase of learning the moves and building the core strength that I did not have from conventional strength training, my confidence began to boost and I started to notice real results. I was sleeping better and had more energy during the day. I also started to shed body fat. Also, the coaches at Ctown are top notch. They are well-trained, enthusiastic, and generally care about helping you get better and improve. I highly recommend Ctown to anyone who wants to get into the best shape of their life in a fun and supportive environment.",positive
"Awesome new Crossfit box! The coaches here know what they are talking about! They don't care about how heavy you are lifting, they are more concerned about proper form and not hurting yourself, yet still giving it all you got! The community here is unreal. Everyone is so friendly!!! You will seriously feel like family when you get here! I know they will be working on getting more class times for the morning, afternoon, and evenings! They will also be getting child care if members will utilize it! I highly urge you to come and check us out!!",positive
"Temporarily closed due to complaints of excessive loud music...? This business was approved to operate in said location and if noise was an issue, the city would not have approved operations there... Right? I am confused and disheartened. Note - never been here, so giving 5 stars for now because I was really excited to dance Zumba here. This would've been the perfect location for me.",positive
Fun studio! Zumba with Eva and Marcel are a blast. Fun choreography. Keeps you sweating...way more fun than running on the treadmill at the gym! Prices are extremely reasonable. Lots of options depending on how often you plan to take classes. The packages end up working out to less than $5 a class. Glad to find this place!,positive
I tried out the zumba class under Eva and I must say that Eva knows what she is doing. You can see her passion for dance in the way she moves and her facial expressions just give life to it! She is one of the best zumba instructors in Vegas,positive
"EZ Fitness is where they make fitness fun! With amazing instructors and amazing environment, it is THE place to be if you want to experience Zumba Fitness in Las Vegas! Want strength and tone? Check out Eva's Power Flow class! A full body workout in only 45 minutes!",positive
"Zumba at EZ Fitness is NO JOKE! You will bust a hard sweat! Amazing Cardio workout with the AMAZING EVA! She rocks the party, has fun and gets it in! I love how she invites others on stage and she also gets down and dirty with class when she joins us on the floor! Total MI FAMILIA style! It's fun and great people! Great spirit as soon as you walk in, you definitely feel welcomed. You feel like you are at a club on the Strip getting your party on without that snobbishness!!! FUN! FUN! FUN!",positive
Ez fitness the place to be!! I love the classes and the energy the atmosphere and the instructors!!! Best workout I've ever actuAlly enjoyed doing and look forward too!!,positive
"I was so excited to see that my favorite Zumba Fitness instructor opened up her own studio! Eva is extremely talented, and makes everyone feel welcome. The studio looks great! Love the Instagram frame for selfies! Mirrors made it feel nice and open, and the flooring was great. There was also plenty of parking, and it was easy to get too, just off the 215. Before relocating to Las Vegas, I was a Zumba instructor, and have attended several ZIN conventions, with instructors from around the world. Eva ranks right up there with the very best. She is both an incredible dancer, and an incredible instructor. Her non-verbal cues are outstanding, and I find she is extremely easy to follow. Her extensive dance background shows through with choreography embracing world music of all genres. Whether you are a local, or visiting from out of town, if you take one Zumba class this year - make sure it's here!",positive
Zumba with Eva is not just an exercise class...:. It's an experience!! You are missing out if you have not been to see her!!!,positive
"You have got to come check out Eva at the EZ Spot. She is the best Zumba instructor out there. She is kind, talented beyond belief, and is extremely passionate about life, fitness, and making people happy through dance. The classes are fun, high energy, and are my favorite hour of the day. I have been taking classes with Eva for years and she truly is the best. Check out the studio, one time you will be hooked!!",positive
100% Best place in town to Zumba with the best instructor Eva Valdes!! I never liked working out until I found her and zumba! It's like a party every class! So much fun. I lost 50 pounds doing zumba and healthy eating. I'm forever grateful to Eva for her help! You must check out the EZ Spot!!,positive
Amazing place for Zumba!! Eva is a great instructor and everyone involved has great energy!! You have to check this place out!! You get a great workout and have fun all at the same time!!! #breathelovedance,positive
Such and Amazing place with great energy! I've been working out with Eva for a few months and of course with some healthy eating I've lost 24lbs! It's always a party and the Hr goes by fast which leaves you wanting more! It's a must to come and checkout her studio!!,positive
What an amazing and fun class by Eva. I would recommend it to everyone. Come and shake it and have fun! And at the same time burn lots of calories. Class is over and you leave wanting more. Check it out!!,positive
"The staff was very friendly and helpful, but the facilities leave a lot to be desired. Everything is cramped and small; there is no indoor pool or hot tub in the ""off season - won't open until April when I'll be going back home to Minnesota. The Y I go to there has indoor pool, hot tub, and wet sauna open all year, so I was surprised that it is ""too expensive"" to keep an indoor pool and hot tub available here open. Even the senior RV resort I'm staying at has an outdoor pool and spa (although small) open year around.",negative
"If I could give 0 stars I would. I have been a ymca member for 5 years in Colorado and thought I'd transfer my membership here. From day 1 I've had nothing but problems. They don't return calls at All. Ross Farnsworth is a great facility if you are single, elderly or can work around their crazy hours. I tried using their childwatch facility but the kids that worked for them have no experience with children. They want to sit on chairs and engage their coworkers not the children. The cardio area half the machines are out of service. The weight area is unattended so people abuse the equipment due to lack of instruction on use. One young man there is incredible, his name is Steve. He is the best person in that facility. He will be the only person we miss. I truly hope he goes far in life. Avoid this facility at all cost. There are too many options here to settle for meridiocracy.",negative
"I sent my child to Camp Edwards through the Redlands YMCA as a CIT (counselor in training). While at the camp a staff member provided my child, an underage minor, with alcohol. My child was sent home a day early from camp. I had to drive out to Big Bear to pick him up from the camp location. After making several inquiries without a response, Terry a director for the YMCA contacted me 7 days later. I told him a wanted a written report of what transpired with my child and he refused to provide me any information in writing what so ever. It is appalling to me as a teacher that an organization that is so entrenched in our society would allow such a thing to occur and then to flat out refuse to provide us with any information of the situation. I would not recommend anyone to take their child to this YMCA. Clearly, this is a place where children should never be taken to.",negative
Worst summer camp ever! My son was completely miserable and literally still cries if we talk about it. They have extremely poor communication with parents. Even when paying $1000 a month to attend they charge an additional $5 for a snowcone but never tell you when its snowcone day so just the kids that always bring money get to enjoy a treat while the other kids watch! They took a field trip to skate-land and I specifically asked about getting my child a walker because he wasn't great at skating. I was told it wasn't necessary to provide extra money because they give them to the YMCA kids for free. WRONG! My son came home with sore and bruised knees and elbows because he was told it cost extra and he has already spent his money on food and drink. Which he also came home with a DIET coke they allowed him to purchase there. *He contracted a skin virus from the pool which resulted in a year of dermatology visits and painful removal to stop it from spreading *They charged me twice one week and when they refunded the money it was $10 short and I was told it was a processing fee for the refund of THEIR mistake. The corporate manager was extremely rude about refunding the money and didn't care about any of my complaints. WE WILL NEVER RETURN!,negative
Awesome gym for a great family price. Also includes great day care right on site for the kiddos while at the gym. Pool is also nice when it is open and will be opening on 3/1/2016!,positive
"This review isn't against the facility itself, but is against the organization, business, and Insurance provider (The Redwood Group), mostly against the insurance company. My son was there for a scheduled basketball practice on a Monday night about a month ago while a storm was coming through. A mesquite tree had fallen on his car causing quite a bit a damage and broken pieces on his car. After filling out an accident report inside. It was communicated to me that their insurance company (The Redwood Group) won't cover anything as it was deemed an act of nature. Not only was this incident on their property, it was by a Mesquite tree planted by the Y in their parking. As a matter of fact there were multiple other Mesquite trees that had fallen, split or otherwise collapsed. Planting this sort of vegetation, that is almost guaranteed to split when there is any amount of rain, is beyond me and should be considered a liability. After spending a substantial amount of money to YMCA over the course of 4-5 years for my two boys to play in the Competitive Basketball League in almost every season, this is horrible way to treat their customers. Their insurance company (The Redwood Group) is now directing the YMCA to not even offer to pay a little bit as it would be considered a fault in their business practices. Considering my sons car is older, we didn't put comprehensive coverage on it, so we can't even open a claim with our insurance provider. This specific occurance should be considered negligence on the YMCA's part for having a tree with a trunk that was growing at a 45 degree angle over the parking lot. In doing research this specific Mesquite tree has the softest wood, so when it gets wet, the wood get softer and the leave capture most of the moisture. Thus increasing the weight at the top, then it's just a matter of time of when it will split, not if. At this point, just a little consideration from the insurance company (The Redwood Group) and/or the YMCA to help with the damage that incurred on their property would be the right thing to do. Again, not only was my son there for a practice the YMCA scheduled, otherwise he wouldn't have been there, it was their property, and a by a mesquite tree that wasn't properly maintained. I'm writing this review not becuase I'm looking for a hand out, but am wanting the YMCA and The Redwood Group to take responsibility and do the right thing. Especially after all of the money I've paid them for my boys to have memberships there and to play basketball.",negative
"The place itself is pretty clean. Not a lot of machine variety. Plus the hours are not great because they close pretty early. Good for families, but not much else.",negative
"so i've been coming here for about 2.5 years...i decided to join 24 hour fitness to find something that suited my schedule more and i guess its always greener on the other side. YMCA blew away the 24 hour fitness I went to in regards to cleanliness, new equipment and availability of equipment. I apologize YMCA! I cancelled my 24 hour fitness membership after 72 hours and am now back to the Y for good. So what if i can't play basketball here...after tearing my ACL/MCL.lateral meniscus here - I think it's time to hang up the laces anyway.",positive
"I like working out here. I go to school right next door, so it's easy to stay a little later after my day is over to work out. At first I didn't like that I would see my schoolmates and it felt awkward, but after going several times and feeling like a regular I'm happy to see people and say hi to them. I guess it was just a confidence thing. I like using the machines - make sure you are engaging the muscles the machine is meant for, engage your abs, and keep your back straight. Classes are fun! I tried Zumba and Boot camp and got a lot out of both of them! As with all gyms, some teachers are better than others so try multiple times that work in your schedule find your favorite!",positive
"ATSU students have membership to the YMCA included in our tuition so I'm very grateful for its convenient location right next to campus. It's never too busy, I can always find an open treadmill or elliptical machine (and I go to the Y almost everyday, at all times of the day - 5 pm, 7 pm, 8 pm, 9 pm). There's cable TV on every unit, and an Ipod charger. They always keep the temperature just right, not too hot nor cold (where it's hard to move your muscles). Staff is super friendly too! The classes are great! I've tried Yoga (not the best workout, but if you want a relaxing stretching hour, it's great) and Body Pump (if it's your first body pump class, make sure to use the lightest weights!) The only downside is that on weekends they have limited open hours (12 - 5 pm).",positive
"If you have a family with a lot of little kids, are absolutely happy with your body, and only want to leave your house to change your scenery, this is your place. If you are looking for a great workout, this is not your place. The hours are pretty bad and you have to plan your schedule around them. The cardio machines are good. The variety of weights is okay but they are all over the place. They have a suggestion box, but they don't take them seriously. The classes used to be good, but now the quality has gone down. The zumba class used to be my favorite, but not so much anymore. They should have different levels, but there is only one and it is slow. There are kids all over the place. I dont understand what parent would want their 6 year old girl learning to shake her butt, but I can't judge, I don't have a kid. Maybe when I have one I would want her to learn to dance low and shake it, so she can be asked to go on MTV. The majority of the classes are in the middle of the day, which is great if you dont have a job or anything to do with your time. Yoga? there were a couple good instructors, but they are not there anymore. What do you guys do to your instructors? Why do they run away? Why do you make it hard to get a good workout? I dont think I am asking for much here, just a place that I can get a good workout.",negative
"Stressed out? Burn off some steam @ the Y! The East Valley Branch is mainly infiltrated with A.T. Still students (med, dental, PA, audiology, PT students) since its the building right next door. I've taken cycling classes and yoga classes. I mainly come here for cardio and weight training. The only down fall is that its not open past 10pm, and closes early on weekends. I've posted the hours since I've come here one too many times when it was closed. Hours Monday - Thursday 5:30AM to 10:00PM Friday 5:30AM to 8:00PM Saturday 7:00AM to 5:00PM Sunday 12:00PM to 5:00PM",positive

"El Jefe Crossfit is the kind of place that you walk into and immediately feel welcomed. There is an amazing energy through out the gym. They offer so many different options when it comes to your preferred type of workout. Whether it be crossfit, power lifting, Olympic lifting, strongman, competitor, OCR training, endurance, gymnastics, teen athletics, kids classes, or even Yoga, this gym has it all, and has an amazing coach to teach it.",positive
I have been a member here for about 2 weeks and I am loving it so far! There are so many classes to choose from. Every coach will push you to be the best athlete that you can be. The other members have been nothing but welcoming and helpful. There's even classes for kids and kid care!,positive
"I started el jefe about a month ago and I was definitely a little intimidated despite having worked out regularly for the last year. However I quickly felt at home from all the amazing el jefe family members. To anyone who has ever wanted to be pushed to the next level or try anything from CrossFit, powerlifting, weight training to my favorite strongman and more this is the gym for you! They are not just a crossfit gym but a community of amazing people who really want to help you take it to the next level. Stop by and try out a class, you have nothing to lose!",positive
"El Jefe is great environment for working out. The coaches will shape your workout around your physical limitations. After having both my hips replaced, I was concerned about how much I could workout. I am always given options that fit my abilities and still achieve the desired results. During my time at El Jefe I have been able to strengthen my joints while increasing my abilities. The staff is always welcoming and encouraging.",positive
"This place is a joke and a half. Jovann, or Josey, or whatever his name is has no problems playing BS legal games and trying to smear/ruin someone's business and reputation. And Simone, will backstab you talk ish behind your back, and do everything she can to undermine you if you don't play along and toe the line. The place is infested with insects, ranging from mosquitoes to scorpions. They have no equipment to offer really, other than cross fit stuff. They kicked our entire crew out based on the lie of that we were stealing or ""poaching"" clients and only gave us a two hour window to move everything. Lies, jealousy, and pettiness is what you'll find here. Even if you just want to do cross fit, you could do better. I'm honestly surprised they're still in business.",negative
"At first I was excited to be a part of this great community and amazing gym they play out to be. However in time I realized that is not what El Jefe is all about. If you seek drama and poor business etiquette, El Jefe is right for you. They have no problem being fake to get a dollar, that's for sure. I tried to cancel my membership due to falling on hard times and unable to afford it. The owner would not respond to my emails or requests, purposely ignoring the fact because a 30 day notice was needed. Once she responded, instead of understanding, she tried to decrease the package I originally signed up for to keep my membership active after I specifically made it clear that I needed to cancel. Same thing happened with many of my other friends who went there. You think they are your friends? After I cancelled, it was like the friendship never existed. The owners are greedy scum and don't care unless you are putting money in their pockets. I will never give El Jefe my business and I hope you decide not to also. There are better gyms out there that actually care about their members health and fitness.",negative
"This gym has become my second home! The owners Somone & Jovan are incredible! They have created something special between the walls of this gym. I started as a 6 week challenger and I now practically live at this gym 3 months later... I have met personal weight loss goals, strength goals, and much much more. Stop into El Jefe, you won't regret it!",positive
"This place is all heart. It's more than a typical CrossFit, it's family too. The coaches are patient, caring, kind, but also push you to be the best athlete you can be. I'm so glad I made this positive change in my life and meet the Jefe family.",positive
El Jefe CrossFit is the BEST! This is our second CrossFit gym and can't say enough good things about it. The owners are so personable AND professional. They treat all of their members with respect. They have so many great classes and coaches it's hard not to spend everyday all day there! Programming is awesome and I'm stronger then ever! My husband and boys also go and love it! Whether your an elite athlete or a mom looking to stay in shape the Coaches at El Jefe will help you meet your goals!,positive
"AMAZING! Introduced to El Jefe through a friend and fell in love with my first class. If you're looking to challenge yourself this is the place to go. The coaches are encouraging and give you the drive to want to finish the workouts. I've done things I never imagined I was strong enough to do. Just started on the journey with them and they have me more than excited for the results. It's truly for any fitness level, they teach you the workouts and work with you. Everyone there has been incredible and so nice.",positive
"Extremely friendly, knowledgeable coaches who really care about your individual needs and goals. It is a family atmosphere where you will have fun and get in great shape, accomplishing things you may not have thought you could! ! Highly recommend!",positive
"I absolutely love this place! It really is my home away from home! The coaches are the best! It's very rare too find coaches that actually know every members names and makes sure that every single athlete is feeling OK after the workouts. They also make sure that the way we lift is correct too hello keep us from getting injuries! They offer more than just crossfit! They offer weightlifting, powerlifting, strongman and combat training classes. They have it all! When you walk through the doors at El Jefe every member welcomes you with open arms! You have to come in and check it out for yourself. You won't regret it!",positive
"The coaches at El Jefe Crossfit go above and beyond to meet your health and fitness goals!!! Whatever you like to do...weightlifting, powerlifting, strongman, Crossfit WODS...they have it! All levels of athletes are welcome into this supportive and growth oriented community!!! Come on out and give it a try!!!",positive
"Definitely a box that stands out and goes above and beyond! Fantastic weightlifting programming, coaching, as well as powerlifting, endurance, and strongman. Crossfit classes are never too large and all ""egos"" are checked at the door,great coaching from top to bottom giving everyone a good workout. Such an inviting atmosphere and group of people. Gym is clean, equipment is fantastic, but the COMMUNITY is what will keep you coming back. Best box in the West Valley hands down!",positive
"There is NO better gym in the area (or anywhere). The perfect place for athletes of all abilities wanting to improve their fitness and have fun while doing it. The coaches and members create an amazingly supportive environment that keeps people coming back every single day. They also have the best programming of any box I have been to. The first class is free so if you are on the fence about trying CrossFit or weightlifting, then you should definitely try out El Jefe. You'll be hooked!",positive
"Where to start... The atmosphere is incredible! One of the big reasons my husband and I started crossfit was to experience the community of it. Along with getting a great, challenging and safe workout we are supported by a community of fantastic and encouraging people. I always look forward to going to El Jefe for the workout but even more so for the El Jefe ""family"" The coaching staff is by far the best I've experienced. Being a little older then the average crossfitter I have a couple old injuries. The staff modifies my workout so I still get a great workout while being aware not to aggravate an injury. Always looking out for our safety :) If you've ever even had a thought to try crossfit this is the place! Just the BEST!",positive
Michael and Melissa are very understanding and helpful! I've attended one of their boot camp classes and it definitely kicked my butt! I will definitely be back to learn some Krav Maga and another boot camp class!,positive
"I was nervous about trying my first Krav Maga class and thinking of excuses of why I shouldn't go. Glad that I didn't back out because everyone here made me feel so welcomed. I plan on staying to learn how to protect my myself and my family. Thanks Michael and Melissa, you guys are awesome!",positive
"I love this place. Mike is a great instructor.. What makes him great is he takes the time for you to see the techniques quickly & in slow motion, will correct you so you're not learning wrong, & emphasizes realism. Melissa is great as well, she brings an awesome energy, she also will break things down even more. They both create an amazing environment to learn. Highly recommended!!! At least try a free class or $40 for the first month for new students.",positive
"I wanted to learn self-defense and get back into shape so I chose Eternity Krav Maga from a Groupon deal I had found. It was definitely the right choice!! The instructors are engaging, friendly, and welcoming to all newcomers, no matter what your fitness level might be. The classes are a great workout, but not super-intimidating for those who might not have previous martial arts experience. From Day One I've learned useful techniques that could help me on the street, and have practiced them in a realistic yet safe environment with other students of varying skill level. It's been such a fantastic experience, and I plan on continuing with Mike and Melissa (super awesome!!!) for as long as I possibly can!!",positive
"My son attended his first class today. He is 16, so he was in with the adult class. I was extremely impressed with this type of self defense/fighting technique. Mike was so great and his wife Melissa was step by step with my son making sure he was comfortable with each and every move. Bravo Eternity Krav Maga!!! I might start taking the class myself. This is real life self defense training and a real cardio workout in one punch!",positive
"I've been going here for about two weeks and I can say that I have learned a lot! If self defense is what you're looking for, this is your place! Other regular boxing gyms focus more on working out than technique, and karate is too slow paced. This Krav Maga class however, teaches you self defense moves that you can use in your everyday life! I go here because Vegas is a crazy city, so you need to learn how to protect yourself and others. Also the people here are friendly and kind, it's like a big family! They also have classes for kids if you want your child to protect yourself in school. I would recommend this to all of my friends!",positive
Mike is such great instructor and his wife Melissa is also great as she helps him. They really take their time with the kids and are extremely passionate about Krav Maga and teaching kids and Adults.,positive
Krav Maga kicks ass! I am obsessed with it! I have been doing Krav Maga for about 4 months now all with Mike here at Eternity Krav. I have grown so quickly it's like I have been doing it for over a year and most of that credit goes to the excellent instructor Mike is. Their class sizes are small so every time I go it's like I am getting a personal training season for a fraction of the price! After just a few months I am much more confident in my ability to protect myself and my loved ones. Thanks mike and the Eternity Krav Maga team.,positive
"This gym is a disaster. It's dirty and unorganized and the plates and freeweights are scattered across the facility. In all honesty, the weight racks are 75% empty because all dumbbells, barbells and plates are thrown on the floor. I understand this is mainly the result of lazy members, but management should be taking care of it. Either hire people to put the weights away or make it clearer to members to put their weights away. I've trained in a number of gyms over the past 10 years and never seen anything like this. You need to budget an extra 15-20 minutes per workout because you're on a scavenger hunt to find a pair of dumbbells.",negative
"Worst experience there. First I told them 1 month ahead for cancellation and still charging me for the next 2 month thu my credit card. Now I have to travel back 2 times and argue with them. Secondly they will upsell you for their personal training and if you say ""NO"" they will send you to another person for more up sell. Overall very bad experience. Will not go back ever again",negative
"Extreme Fitness definitely is one of the premier fitness facilities in the city. They have the best in equipment and offer the most variety of clases I have seen. The instructors are amazing in particular Alin and/or Acky, if you can join in on one of these instructors classes you will be addicted to the high energy, great music classes they both offer and you will be guaranteed results. Thornhill has free parking which is a bonus and there's always parking. The gym and change rooms are clean and spacious there's always someone cleaning the halls and common areas. The other bonus is it offers childcare. I would highly recommend this gym. Lucy K",positive
"Got to try out this gym with a free guest pass over the weekend. This place is N-I-C-E! From the lobby to the change room to the weight room. You don't really appreciate a clean and sufficient change room until you have been into a dirty and cramped one. The change change room had a little lounge area with a tv and couches, hair drying stations, and a steam room (a little tight though). The training area is really modern so you don't feel like you're in a prison with weights. Machines and equipments were sufficient and well spaced. I went on a Saturday morning so the place didn't feel crowded. Maybe if it was weeknights then I can imagine this place being packed like a sardine can. I give this gym a 4 star based on a FREE workout and what it is as a gym. I have no clue what the cost is. My only complain is that they treat guest like ATM machines and very eager to withdrawal cash from you; they held onto my driving license in front of me until a salesperson came over even after I had asked if I can have my license back. So just be careful you don't get caught up with preaching and pressuring. Cheers.",positive
"Gym is cozy, spacious and clean. Can be crowded depending on the time of the day. Monday is the busiest. This gym has two studios that hold two simultaneous classes. It has a huge collection of weights and a good number of benches for weight exercise. It can be intimidating though working out with hard core lifters. There is an estimated of 30 thread mills. ndividual monitors on the thread mill make work out faster (and easier). It's a got a half size salt water pool that is also used for an aquatic class in the afternoon. You'll be with the oldies in this class. Members are decent and mostly professionals. Sometimes, you will meet students with wealthy parents. Class instructors are superb and nice. You'll see cleaners working around the clock to keep the place tidy. The place is huge enough to do floor exercises or lunges almost anywhere. I work out in a lot of Extreme Fitness locations but this one and Richmond branch are my favourites. This is a place where people exercise. If you're unfit, you'll be motivated. As you see men and women with gorgeous body in front of you... you'll tell yourself to keep going... to keep running.",positive
So far I really enjoy this gym... small size and all. The features are just not available at other gyms usually. Most of the negative reviews on here seem to be involving their billing department which has nothing to do with this gym at all ....or people flat out not listening or reading any agreement they signed up for. I dont have much to say about trainers..I dont like using them and I dont want them or anyone else to talk to me while I'm there so I will never complain about that lol. I cant comment on the classes cause I dont like group anything and I havent used the cinema but it seems like a cool idea. Guess I can only see how it works out here. But it's a gym ...you go and you work out it's pretty cut and dry guys. Stop acting like snobs if you want a secluded privileged gym go join David Barton over in Tivoli and stop complaining about basic gyms lmfao,positive
"I checked out Las Vegas Athletic Club before joining EOS. It offered the most services for the money actually less and was certainly the cleanest and least crowded. EOS also appears to be growing at a rapid pace their locations are popping up very conveniently all over town. Same pricing as if you went to Planet Fitness but so much more it's a real gym. Child care is available with video monitoring. Nice swimming pool with an attached sauna. Big locker rooms clean and bright. I highly recommend EOS over the others and its price range. I pay you $20 per month and that includes unlimited classes, the movie theater and use of any location.",positive
Horrible! My friend and I walked in and signed a waiver to possibly sign up today and become members. They asked us to take a seat and wait for someone to show us around. We waited for over 20 minutes!!! Didn't have the courtesy to let us know how long it would be or anything. We walked up and ask if we can at least see the gym and they said no they can't and we should wait. We couldn't wait any longer. They already they started with POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE. They had 4 people working up front and none of them could give us a quick tour. We left!!,negative
"Eos on Sahara is an awesome gym. Shout out to my main man, Joseph and the eos crew for helping me find my keys when I dropped them on the stair master. Everyone is super nice and helpful.",positive
Good luck canceling. They will give you the run around. The manager will not be available ever. Does this manager ever work? Just when you think the scammy mess is over...bam..you get billed again. Then you call the gym...they refer you to some ABC financial...no refunds offered..then they tell you only the manager can issue refunds. It is one big loop of mess. 3 billing cycles after I was assured this would be over...guess what...they steal money again from your card...and tell you if you dispute with your bank...collections will get you.. Thanks EOS for poor customer service..the threat to credit damaged is an excellent businness scam.,negative
I called two months ago to cancel my membership because I'm moving. I kept being charged $5 a month so I made another call today to cancel AGAIN. They said they have no record of my call and can't take my word for it. So far I've been charged $10 more then I should have for these past two months with my account on freeze(which was supposed to be canceled in January) now they want to unfreeze my account and make me pay $20 on top of it to be able to cancel. So I have to PAY them money to be able to stop paying them. This is ridiculous and I wouldn't recommend starting a membership here unless you are okay with paying hidden fees.,negative
Signed up about 3 weeks ago and since day one the experience has been great. I started with Tiffany who got me going with the paper work and answered all my questions. She a great front end person for people to have there first inner actions with and get things going. After deciding on the 25 dollar membership i was introduced to Sara who is the general manger of the trainers i beleave and she introduced some of the options available to have a trainer which ( was not my intention at all when I went in to sign up) but after to talking with her i decided if i really wanted to make a change in my health and loose the weight and become a healthier person after neglecting my eating habits and lack of any real exercise for years that a trainer is what would get me going as well as mentally have a financial commitment to get me in the gym on a regaular basis. So after the all of the paper work is done i am introduced to Stephen who would become my trainer amd i have a conversation with him about getting going. Once all that was set up i get ready to explore the gym and Sara asks if i would like to try the 530 class with Guillermo and if I mind working out with a bunch of women as that's what the class was made up of at that time and i said sure. By the end of the class I thought I was going to die and really realized how out of shape I was in so it was at that point that I decided to go for it and i have tried to be at the gym every morning and every evening for the 5:30 class. I would highly recommend the evening class (also a 930 am class available) which is held by Guillermo who does a great job going through the exercises and motivating you to push through. If you're serious about getting in shape take the class and dedicate your time and effort as it does get easier as time goes by and you will start seeing the changes in your health. If a guy like myself weighing 270 lbs can get out there and do it I'm sure there's a lot of other people that can do it as well. If you're curious about the classes grab any of the trainers or hit up Sarah or even look for the big dude in the class at 5:30 and I'll tell you about my experience. I would also like to Circle back to my trainer Stephen who has been great taking the time to go through my sessions making sure that the exercises I am doing I am able to do as well as showing me the proper form and making sure I pushed through the exercises we are doing. All of my other interactions with the other trainers and staff have been great sometimes only very small interactions but not once have any of the staff not taken the time to say hello or answer a couple simple questions that I have. I would recommend stopping in just to check it out.,positive
"Horrible HORRIBLE place don't waste your time or money here . They could care less about your safety, have unproffesional rude staff and are out for their own financial gain . Worst gym ever . Corparate is investigating their unproffesional practices conducted at this gym as we speak .",negative

"This is a great gym with lots of great equipment and tons of amenities. The staff is responsive to your needs. It is constantly being cleaned. Not all locations are like this although I've only also seen W Lake Mead and their layout, equipment and amenities don't compare to W Sahara. At Sahara there's the best movie theater I've seen outside a regular theater. There's a cycle room, pool, dry sauna, workout classroom, boxing area, and basketball court. I'm sure I've left out some things. It's amazing how this all fits in the area. Sometimes it's a bit crowded but you can always find an alternative workout area. The staff is friendly and responsive. The new training supervisor Sara is a the only improvement I've been waiting for after a short run by another guy. I have Art as my trainer and nobody can beat him.",positive
"It's unfortunate that for my first Yelp reviews I'd be writing a negative one to a place I once saw as my second home. Everything was cool until I decided to cancel my personal trainer. I trained with Art for a year who is AMAZING and I am very pleased with how much I've learned from him. He really has patience and dedication for those who WANT to reach their goals. Fast forward to about 45 days before my yearly contract is up for PT sessions, around mid-October. I talk to the PT manager who replaces Charlie (let's not even go there with him) about canceling my contract, he tells me to write my name and number down and he'd do it for me and to go on with my gym session. I was iffy about leaving after that but decided to trust in that. So the next day I come back to the gym I try looking for him to make sure it's cancelled and I'm told he's taken some days off later to find out he was fired. So I talk to the next guy left to replace him after a few days, mind you I had officially put in my cancellation request before the 30 days or so I thought . The new guy assures me my contract will now be cancelled and I will no longer be charged, last payment being on 11/17. Come that day and guess what? I'm charged again for PT sessions. When I speak to them about this, they try telling me that I will only be charged one more time because technically it wasn't entered until 11/2 when the new guy put in my cancellation. I tell them it was put in before with the previous guy who acted unprofessional with just having written my name and number down instead of sitting me down like a contract should be handled. Corporate being in on that day, they ""agree"" with refunding me that charge. I wait and wait for the refund and after giving them the benefit of the doubt I decide to call abc financial about 2 weeks after to ask for an update on my refund. Lady tells me she doesn't know why I haven't been refunded and tells me to talk to them about issuing me a refund check as there's nothing they can do because ""corporate"" hasn't released the funds. I go in to talk to Josh the manager and tell him what I was told and he first tries to tell me they already refunded me. After I tell him I have nothing on my bank statement he calls corporate guy and guy tells him the money is just sitting there in limbo but he would email them to refund me back asap. I tell Josh that it's ridiculous I'd have to be waiting for a refund this long which I shouldn't have even been charged in the first place and he tells me that if I would've talked to him sooner I wouldn't be waiting this long but He did his part. Right, like this is my fault now for waiting too long. It is now going on 6 weeks and still have not received my refund but if I owed money to them, I bet it wouldn't take 6 weeks for them to come charge me. Horrible customer service. Once I finally get my refund, if I don't cancel my gym membership altogether, I'll atleast be going to a different location.",negative
I absolutely love this gym!! I have been going to the UP (United Performance) training for seven months now and Angel just started coaching last week!! She is the bomb!! Art and Guillermo are great as well but Angel knows how to really work with us women to target areas that guys wouldn't really think of!! Last Monday was the booty boot camp and it was a great workout! Friday with Angel was more cardio which really finished out my week well!! I really enjoy working out and going to the UP training especially now that Angel will be training two nights out of the week!!,positive
"Classes are great here. I wish that the workout room for classes was bigger. There is over 30 people sometimes. The ppl who work there really do not follow up on the gym ""rules"" they just stay up front. I am always cleaning up someone else's sweat and then people in the sauna continue to work out and poor water on the rocks. Pool is really gross in my opinion if you really look at it. The cleaning staff does a great job on keeping the gym clean overall as in the floor and locker rooms. This gym can get very crowded with people who are too busy on snapchat or taking selfies, so be ready for that. Other than that - if this gym did not have great class instructors like Queena, Linda and Didi, I would cancel my membership. The one star is due to Sarah. She came up to me and said I cannot have my bag on the gym floor. That is fine, however EVERYONE else is allowed to? See pics attached. If that is a ""RULE"" then it needs to be a ""rule for everyone else, not just me.",negative
"I work out with my fiance and it's always been great. I would recommend the location. Oh and if your into workout class this is the place. They have a nice variety, not to mention the children's daycare for parents.",positive
"I train with Myk B at EOS and love it! Using a trainer 2-4 times a week is great. I feel motivated to get toned! He makes sure I'm doing the moves right, and pushes me to do better every time. I see many people at this gym using trainers and I think that's great! Thank you, Myk!",positive
"Jerome was the one who signed me up and got me started with everything, he's been wonderful! Always smiling and extremely knowledgeable on everything. He hooked it up with everything. Brian and Maurice are the best personal trainers ever!! They really killed it. I can't wait to train with them again (:",positive
"Golds was a great gym, but than EOS took over and screwed everything up. Now you are just a number and expect to be treated like cattle when you go in there because that's what it feels like. Moooooooooooooooooo",negative
"EOS is a great experience of a gym like the EOS theatre! And I also Like the free weights and the machines they have, friendly staff but sometimes a little moody but everyone has their bad days.",positive
"the worst gym ever!!! dont get a membership of any kind here! save urself that extreme headache and go somewhere else!!!!! seriously! theres no canceling this membership ever! they will keep charging ur card even if u call in and cancel, they do not allow it!",negative
"Very clean and well organized gym nothing to complain about, the layout is perfect as it should be. Friendly staff thanks to Tiffanne for signing me up great customer service as always.",positive
"I have been a member of EOS since opening day at Durango, moved to Sahara as soon as they opened. The staff here is Amazing. Christina at the front desk will remember your name and says hello and good bye on every visit. Brian the AGM is super friendly and always willing to help glad to see he moved from Durango to Sahara. The trainers are very educated at you can easily find one that meets your needs. My trainer Art is crazy smart about fitness ask him anything, RJ is motivated and positive and will light that fire in you. Get some training and let one of these guys show you the road to success. I've seen it and caught the bug!!!",positive
I love this location. Everyone that works here is very friendly and makes it comfortable to be at a gym environment. I also have my son enrolled in the kids club while I am at the gym and I could not be any happier. The staff is very friendly and it makes me feel comfortable leaving my son there even if it's just for an hour. They seem very interactive with the children and do not shy off from knowing them and their likes. My son sometimes even asks for me to take him to kids club but hey it's a good reason for me to take myself to the gym as well haha. 5 stars for sure.,positive
"My husband and I are the new member here. We go to the gym around midnight and workout. My husband loves dancing so he choose dancing as a cardio workout. Today, the front desk guy who named Thomas quietly recorded my husband who was dancing and posted to the Internet and he was laughing while he posting that record to Internet. I guess he found that funny BUT it is totally not fun at all. I believe no one wants to goto the gym and work out then got record and post to the Internet by people who work at the gym. This is unprofessional",negative
"Affordable clean gym! Everyone is always super nice and friendly. There's a movie rooms which is pretty cool. Alexis made it super easy to sign up, he was really nice. And it was really quick so you can get right to your work out.",positive
"January 5th 2017. New Year, New Members. It was absolutely crowded today. All equipment was taken except the cardio machines. It was supposed to be leg day, but it's not worth waiting 20 minutes for a machine. No complaints about that though. I appreciate and respect the new members coming out because of their new goals. The boxing was out of order today. So it was definitely a sad day. Unsure why, but they better get that done fast considering that's one the pros they have against the Durango location. Good customer service from front desk, Bailey, who was kind enough to my brother's first experience at the gym. I also forgot my towel at home, so Josh, the manager, was kind enough to let me borrow one during my work out. I always feel so welcomed being here.",positive
I'm harsh but the truth. Be AWARE!!! They are some thieves in that gym. Maybe I was the first one who got hit since the gym open but 3 days ago my lock was broken and black hoody and wallet stolen. Again be aware. The problem I have is that management doesn't seem to care much about it or do anything about it. They are also people who use the gym who are not members or on a guest pass that enter unseen. I'm really sorry to write bad review but I really don't feel secure going there anymore. I expected lot more done. So don't bring anything valuable and try to use better locks which still it's no guarantee. Now on the good note as far as everything else yes the gym have great equipment not too busy so you get to do your work out in and out. Stay safe.,negative
This place is nice! My man Gus was awesome getting me in here. I've been to almost all of the EOS's but I gotta say this one is the best! It's not too busy like Durango and has all new equipment not like Stephanie or Eastern. I live all the way in Henderson but I go straight here from work!,positive
"Brand new location and sparkling clean! This location was much needed. Even though we live in Centennial Hills, we are in this area pretty much every day, so stopping in for a quick cardio session for an hour is very convenient. The cinema room at this location is the best of all the EOSs. No outside light or sound comes in. It used to be SUPER cold in there, which was great once you worked up a sweat, but walking in with a sweater, then getting hot, then having to stop to take off your sweater was kind of a bit of a pain. Now it's much more comfortable in there. There's about 4 ellipticals and one stair machine in the back, then 4 or 5 treadmills, and a front row of about another 5 bikes. It's never too crowded in there that I can't get the machine I want, so that's always good too. They often play newish movies, usually action movies, which are great for keeping your mind off working out especially during chase/fight scenes. The pool is not yet done, but it's getting there. Should be a couple more months still. But the rest of the gym is very nice and pretty spacious. I just wish the cross fit area was up against a wall so I could practice handstands, since I can't do them without walls yet. There doesn't seem to be any other good spot for that unless the group class room is open. Speaking of the classes, if you're into yoga, try out Scott's class on Sat at 1pm. It's becoming a pretty popular class now. Everytime I see other kinds of classes here, there's about 5 people. Last Sat there were probably close to 20 people in his class.",positive
"The gym is fine. God help you if you have a problem with their billing. The hoops they will make you jump through will leave you breathless, and don't plan on EVER canceling your membership.",negative
"So far so good. This place is clean and the machines are awesome. I hope it stays this way. The pool, I was told, is opening in November. Can't wait for that! Also, the staff is friendly and professional. Highly recommended EOS location for customers living in Summerlin.",positive
"As a long time member of this gym I surprised the management is ignoring the ventilation of the building. It smells like a arm pit. Knowing ventilation requirements, it would appear the outside air intake are closed to save energy. Used the gym today and it appears that the outdoor intakes located on the ac system are open again, now provide some fresh air to remove the stale air. Thank you",negative
"Shawn Bork is a great trainer. I had to start off slow because of my health, now all my girlfriends are surprised at my results and it's only been 3 months!",positive
"Cold Hearted Snakes. At about the same time they let my trainer Shawn Bork go I was diagnosed with cancer. I hand delivered a cancellation notice on 4-16-18. They continue to deduct training charges from my bank account. Today was the third time! Before today's deduction they said they owed me 15 sessions! I told them I had 8 weeks of radiation and didn't know when I could come back for training. Warning, $128.00 is a lot more important to them than any clients health or loyalty. I am at my wits end with them. You have been warned.",negative
"I moved out here when this place was still Gold's gym and I was member for 4 years prior to that. I got tired of the large crowds that started accumulating and the poor maintenance of the equipment. So I switched over to Lifetime Fitness, definitely worth the money. One of the sales rep dropped off a few passes at my office. Several years have passed and I figured I give them another chance as a secondary gym. The place is still the same old dump. The sales rep wouldn't even allow me to use the pass because of my out of state driver's license. I'm out here on military orders and they still didn't allow it. I'll stick to Lifetime and keep LA Fitness as my secondary.",negative
I've been coming to this gym for just over 6 months and I'm very happy with the value. They are constantly updating equipment and the facilities are nice and clean. It gets busy but it has always been manageable. I've been working with my trainer Shawn for the last month and I'm very happy with the results.,positive
"Finally found a gym worth going to. The sign up was so easy . Right off the bat Lauren H. Welcomed me with a smile and explained a bit about the gym and then had me registered in about 5 minutes. Great customer service, great gym, great prices, just a awesome place all around.",positive
"This is the best Gym by far in Gilbert/Mesa Location!!! I've been coming to this location for years, overall the staff and Management Team are extremely professional and very personable, Great equipment, they brought in more cardio equipment which is a plus, the amenities that the Gym has to offer are great they have a stocked fridge full of Energy Drinks, Protein Drinks, Water, Gatorade, etc, which is very beneficial to the members as well as staff. The Gym is regularly maintained and the cleanliness is above average. The gym members are very friendly and helpful in the gym, as well as the staff that work there, talk about customer service, they are always willing to go out of there way to make the clients feel that they are valued members. If there is any faulty equipment due to malfunctions etc, The staff are usually quick to fix the issue, long story short this gym speaks for itself, you won't regret it.",positive
"Started off a little bumpy ironing out the details of my membership and personal training contract, but after working with the PT manager he was able to really help me out. He hooked it up and got me what I wanted with my packages. Most of the staff are great with customer service and their PT trainers are all good people ... Daycares awesome too, the ladies in there are great and keep it cool handling tons of kids, as far as I can see they clean often and sterilize what they can ...",negative
"I called tonight to downgrade my boyfriends membership because he pays for the gold plus assuming I was going to be his guest to bring every time and that he would use multiple locations. Although he's been paying that price for months now he's never taken advantage of anything other than the weight equipment. With that being explained to the associate Noel she told me it would be a $29 downgrade fee. When I explained to her he was never made aware of that and if there were any way to waive that fee, her response was ""we purposely don't tell people about the fee because we don't assume they'll downgrade."" As a paying customer it's not fair to have information withheld from you. When I expressed my feelings about her statement she continued to say ""you have to pay a $29 fee because we are losing money by you downgrading."" As if her rude tone of voice and how she repeatedly cut me off wasn't frustrating enough when I asked for her GM's email she refused to give it to me. She took my number and said he'd call tomorrow. I told her by the way she has been treating me I didn't feel as if she would pass my message along so I really wanted his email and she began to become even more hostile, not to mention that she hung up on me. I work in customer service and I can tell you right now myself nor one of my employees would currently be employed right now if we handled the situation the way Noel did. From the reviews I've read it looks as if the manager most likely will not be in contact with me, unfortunate that this is the way I was treated because I needed to change my rates.",negative
"I changed gyms from a different chain because I wanted new and different equipment. I signed up for personal training and have been working with Baxter for a few weeks now. He is awesome. He is on it, stern, motivating and pushes me but makes the workout fun! The gym is upgrading all the time and you can't beat the location and price... I highly recommend checking out the training services there!",positive
"The gym has most of what one needs to get a great workout in. I would like to see some heavy bags though. They have been upgrading the equipment, which is always great to see. Overall the staff is polite, however there is one particular personnel who, Unfortunately, has the position of kids club manager who is very rude. She has been demeaning on multiple occasions. Today she expressed displeasure toward my wife for a yelp review she posted months ago. ""Staff are generally nice. Kids area is better for under 8 years old as older kids are very bored and the staff are tending to the toddlers."" This young lady acts more like a child with too much makeup when accepting constructive criticism. Instead of taking the opportunity to improve the customer experience she wants to demean the customer for their opinion. I hope EoS will reconsider her position as she still requires a lot of maturity and professional growth.",positive
"We have repeatedly asked to have the shower curtain fixed in the women's locker room (shower) area-but like the equipment and batteries in the wall clocks -we may have to do it ourselves. So if you are looking to just work out for a economical price-then YES, this is a good gym for that. If you want ANY amenities (like shower curtains and working clocks)-then NO.",negative
"I have been going here about a month or so and I love it! I have recieved help from the trainers and its been awesome! Sean and Lorenzo are great! On my first day Sean took me out for free and made me feel very comfortable. The best part is that I pay them to train me but they don't yell at me. That was always something that was hard to find, I want to be push and encouraged but I don't want to pay someone to yell at me haha definitely happy I found this place!",positive
"Wanting to be more active and fit, I recently joined EoS. The location is perfect for me and 24 hour operating hours truly works for my hectic work schedule. Not a Globo Gym and I'm totally ok with that. This gym has everything I need. It can get crowded but I do go at peak times (after work) which is understandable. I receive personal training from Kandice and I really didn't expect to see good results in 30 days, but I have! Kandice listens to me regarding goals/concerns, gives good advice and she pushes me. I feel motivated and I'm excited to see what progress I make in the next 60 days.",positive
I needed a 24 hour gym at a cheap rate to get my fasted cardio in before work. It's the perfect place to go when I'm restless at night and can't sleep. Loving this gym!,positive
"If you go by the pics that the site has on here, that is not what you are getting at the Gilbert location. I have been a member for 18 months. I love the classes that I went to but very crowded-hardly room to move. They should have a schedule and limit the size so one isn't bumping into everyone. I wish they'd have more daily classes so they don't have to be crammed to the gills. It's a $10.00 gym. You get what you pay for. You just never know walking in what is going to be working and what isn't. Sometimes that means finding an alternative machine that one doesnss't usually use to kill time. It's a little on the rank side. One can tell people are working out. I am not sure if it is the building or the way the air is filtered. It's not too bothersome once one gets used to it, overall. During the evening, there is ""the stroll"" as I like to tease about it. Where people just walk around and talk with each other. Maybe they are waiting for equipment, maybe they are between sets but I don't get why if one goes to the gym to work out, why are they cruising around chatting. So I just started going straight to the classes and straight out. I decided to go to another gym and that is where my irritation resides with EOS. Not so much the gym but with the company they hired to handle their membership charges. The gym says to go online (myiclubOnline.com) to cancel. I go online but I can't do anything until I register my name/email/phone number along with my contract #. I didn't have my contract # handy. I had to call 888-827-9262 to get my contract number. It won't let me cancel by phone either till I register online. So I register for their website (nothing like giving a company all your new contact info prior to cancelling) and there is nothing about how to cancel a membership on their webpage/no forms,etc. Very limited website so not hard to miss. So, I call the initial # and because I am NOW registered online, it lets me talk to a representative. She will be more than happy to cancel the subscription for $15.00 AND I have to pay for one month going forward. I knew about the cancellation fee but not the month going forward. (People NEVER read those contracts---right!!) So it cost me $35.95 to cancel. Not too shabby business practice,lol. Then she says, ""I am sending you an email regarding the cancellation. I have it on Automatic withdrawal and the email says if the payment is not made, the acct will remain active with dues/fee accruing till it is paid in full. Why would I be responsible for them NOT taking the money out. UGGGGgggg! What a nightmare. And it doesn't seem it is just this Gym that has the same policy. Going forward,I will make sure that I read how to cancel any membership prior to signing a contract. No company should make stopping their service so complicated. So be forewarned. Going to this gym may make you workout more than your body.",negative
"Great club with tons of equipment and classes! Kevin the Manager and staff are always greeting guests with a smile, definitely worth checking out!",positive
I have been coming to this gym for over 5 years. Kevin has been a great guy to get things done and fixed. They will treat you like family at this location.,positive
"I hit up an old buddy from high school named Kevin, askin about the gym. After being at LA fitness on signal butte for a while I was tired of it there (if anyone goes there or has been I'm sure you understand why) and decided to try EoS. Kevin wasted no time. Gave me a tour, covered every area of the gym but didn't drag it out like some places do. Got me signed up quick and easy and made it a great transition. The gym is well kept and has an old school feel which I love. Bonus, people actually have gym etiquette and know how to put there stuff away. Trainers seem to be real involved with their clients and staff is always awesome!",positive
"You don't have to be the Terminator or the Hulk to work out at this gym even though EOS formally Golds Gym is where Schwarzenegger and Ferrigno got their start! Muscle men and women continue to train here but with an affordable monthly fee and friendly staff this gym is for everyone! Whether you want slim down with some cardio or grab some weights to pump you up EOS has what you need. They offer personal trainers and a variety classes but never try to lay on the muscle to pressure you in. I prefer to work out at night where I can bleed clear without an audience because ladies don't sweat or so I've heard. The ladies work out room is the perfect place for me to do that. When I go in during the day, early evenings & on the weekends the Kid's Club provides attentive and friendly care for my mini me. I'm always amazed how they manage to know and remember every kid's name. These ladies are keeping a list and checking it twice because the kids all love them & everything is so clean and kept nice! Hand sanitizer is provided even though no sick kids are allowed but even the cutest kid can carry hidden ugly germs. So whether you're looking to lose a few pounds, gain some muscle or both EOS is open 24/7 to give your body a great workout!",positive
"The thing about this EOS location that i absolutely LOVE is their Kids Club! I don't feel like just another parent dropping off another child. The staff gets to know me and my child. I feel like they treat my child like their own and I know that she will be well taken care of while I'm working out. As I became a regular they even noticed when I missed a few workouts and asked how things were going because they hadn't seen me in awhile. THAT speaks the most to me. You can't beat that kind of customer service, it's so personable! And it only costs me $12 a month to add childcare to my account! Totally worth it for the level of care my child gets when we go!! I definitely recommend adding it so that you can work out with your mind at ease over the care of you child!",positive
"I recently joined eos through Kevin and already it has become one of my favorite gyms in AZ. Not only is the membership low in cost but you get lots of value. I love the fact that they are open 24/7 making it convenient to work out with my busy schedule. They have a bunch of cardio equipment, weights, classes, personal training, and my personal favorite a ""privacy"" work out room. The staff are always very friendly and knowledgeable. I highly recommend this gym to everyone.",positive
Great gym and great manager Kevin. Always helpful and handles any situation. Lots of great equipment and atmosphere. Def recommend!,positive
You get what you pay for. Membership is $9.99... This location is kind of dirty. Trash everywhere and no one re racks their weights also the lighting is rather abrasive. I much prefer the north Scottsdale location but this one is closet to my house. I do like that it is 24/7 and the amount of machines and weights they have so that's good.,negative
This place is the place of all places. Great gym environment for the common man as well as the advance gym rat. Check it out,positive
"I usually go to a different location but work brought me to this part of town. and it has really made me appreciate my regular location because this place is a total shitbox. They had alot more equiment than my regular location, but alot of the benches in the dumbell area had loose pads, all of them, as well as the dumbell racks, had visible rust. The incline benches were the most unergonomic i have ever witnessed, leaving me with a sore lower back. There is alot of new equipment, but just as much equipment looks like its been there since the late 80s. Took me a while to find the paper towel dispensers and bleach, and when I did, I noticed the drywall was stained brown with sweat. All around the place was pretty filthy, and if they don't bother with good housekeeping I doubt they do a good job of disinfecting the place. So if staph is your thing, this might be the place for you. The cardio equipment was shoddy, and dated. The fluorescent lighting and muggy atmosphere made it feel like a special kind of limbo. We had a better kept gym in Afghanistan, and that was a plywood and brick shack with an 80% chance of mortar fire. I definitely won't be returning unless they go through a massive overhaul.",negative
"Horrible!. The place is crap. Antiquated machines crowded together. And do not give them any credit card information. In addition to the $10 a month, they charged me $49 to maintain the $10 per month. What? When I tried to cancel my training they told me there is a $50 fee. I thought the signup was for 3 months they have now taken out $74 for 4 months. I cancelled the debit card I gave them but they got around that and still got the money through a loophole. Their aim is not to get you in shape, it's to get as much $ from you as possible. Be warned.",negative
"Trisha at the front desk is awesome! As far as the gym goes I haven't seen much change since it changed from Golds, two thumbs up.",positive
"Anyone looking for a gym membership should avoid #EosFitness (formerly Golds Gym) at all costs. They are only there to squeeze money out of you. Customer service is horrible and sounds like a bunch of robots regurgitation ""per our policy.."" crap. Somehow, I cancel my membership because they don't have a facility in Honolulu, and suddenly I am charged a yearly fee. Seems a little suspect that I cancel my membership (fully aware I have to give 30 days notice and get charged one more monthly fee) and exactly FOUR days later they charge an annual fee?! Highly suspect. Been a member over 3 years and this is the appreciation my loyalty is rewarded with, squeezing a few extra dimes outta me. ""There's principalities in this ish Smokey!""",negative
"I wrote the review below for Gold's Gym but the page redirected me to EOS. If this is the same company that ran Gold's this is what happened to me: The facility was average but the issue that I had was that they didn't cancel my membership when I called and asked them to. The woman who I spoke to said that I was all set but that was certainly not the case. I used a credit card that I don't use often so I didn't see the reoccurring charges, but eventually rather than calling me about it they sent debt collectors. It was a complete disaster and the only way for me to fight it was to get a lawyer. In the end it was just cheaper to pay them. They are a crooked company so beware!",negative
"A couple of my friends said that I should attend a free week with them because I have some fitness goals that I would like to reach. I lack motivation when it comes to going to the gym by myself so I figured why not, and I went to try it out for a free week session. Today I finished my 8th day in a row and yesterday, without any hesitation, signed up for an unlimited monthly membership. There was no pressure to sign up at all, and while the price tag may be daunting to some people, when you consider everything about this place the price is MORE than worth it. After just 8 days, one workout per day, I am already seeing results. The trainers here are absolutely amazing. If you are struggling with a work out they will take the time with you to go over how to correctly do it so that you are not hurting yourself but still getting an effective workout with any modifications. I LOVE that the classes are smaller. Every member roots for others in the classes and helps motivate them. Even if you don't know each other - high fives and ""great jobs"" all around. You don't have to be in amazing shape to start classes here. I sure as heck am not! Yes, the workouts are intense, but they get the job done!!!",positive
"Joined the Saturday training session! What a great workout! Fast, efficient, and fun! Abby was the trainer for the morning and she was great. Very knowledgeable and motivating! 640 calories burned in 36 minutes! Highly recommended!!",positive
"This is a really tough workout and definitely not designed for everybody or for different fitness levels. In fact, you must be in really good shape and good health to attend a class and do very well with high intensity interval training. Just because the workout doesn't seem all that long (forty five minutes on average), the fact is there is very little rest between actual intervals. The intervals last one minute take you from one station (and there were twelve!) to the next with a thirty second rest period which is very little. I thought I would enjoy it and I really didn't. No one from Fit36 called me as they said they would to follow up on my first session and this shows how little they really care.",negative
"Love the workouts, trainers, music and energy! Bryan is so motivating and really helps me with my form . He is willing to make adaptions in the exercise it is too difficult for me. However, all of the trainers are Rock Stars",positive
Amazing trainers and staff! The workout is different every time and challenging every time- I'm sore for days after one workout ! Trainers help modify the moves for you throughout the workout and also come around and help you improve your form. I highly recommend trying a class,positive
"Absolutely love this studio! Prior to them opening, I heard about a HIT Interval Training class in my area and reached out to learn about class times, rates, trainers, etc. I had done Orange Theory in the past, so I was familiar with HIT classes that used heart monitors to track performance. I've had an absolutely great experience from the very beginning. I worked with Nikki and she's been so great in helping me get situated! The trainers are awesome! The majority of my classes have been with Asia or Brian - love their classes! But really all of the trainers have been great. Since the studio is new, the facilities are in beautiful shape. Very clean. Nothing is there that you aren't using. With 24 people in each class and 12 stations, you're close enough to encourage your neighbor, but far enough to have your space. Class times range. Starting at 5 am to 6 pm. The workouts can change during the week or you can do two classes in a week that have the same workout. But there are so many variations to each exercise so the ""same workout"" can be completely different classes/experiences. Highly recommend this studio!! I'm very excited to see where it goes.",positive
"Too many fees after a few months. At first, I didn't think it mattered, but, exercising just 12 inches away from a stranger, is a bit too much. The equipment is crammed together, as if, all of us are friends' or family... Glad I choice to end my membership.",negative
I recommend it 100 percent the place is always clean if you are looking for a nice place to work out stop looking this is the right place to start.,positive
"Beware of their hidden fees.....After being a Member for only 3 months. I was charged an annual fee for each member of my family. $196 to join $19 per month for a family of 4. And just after 3 months of being there, another $76 comes out of my account for an ""annual fee"". Plus $19. Was told by Anthony In an email that it would be returned/refunded!That I needed to wait to receive my check until the following week. Went in to pick it up. Check wasn't ready until the following day, went in the following day at 9am. I was told to come back at 10. Went back I was told there's no check but he felt bad that I wasn't told about the annual fee and wanted to give me $19 cash. I told him to keep his $19. I was charged $76!, plus $19 for the month.",negative
"Never busy when I am ready to rock. Nice and clean, too. Employees are over the top helpful but not all up in your grill while you work out.",positive
Great affordable gym with daycare. Has pretty much everything you need to train without all the excess that usually costs you more in membership fees. Great that it's no contract and I have never seen anything broken. Also love that I see other women in the weights area which is not typical with most other gyms. A+ for a no frills get it done workout. Staff is always super nice and friendly. We are military so will hate to move when we eventually do because I love it here.,positive
"Talk about a relaxed stress free environment. Ok, so there's no pool and no locker room, so what. You will never have anything stolen if you don't have a locker room. They do provide lockers but it's right inside the gym. Perfect! Nobody is hassling you about having a towel or making a little noise. Everything in moderation. It is very clean, the equipment is new. I have not seen an out of order sign on anything. Friendly staff that greet you by name when you walk in. Oh, did I mention the best part? It's the best priced gym you could go to.",positive
"BUYER BEWARE !!!!!! I Wouldnt recommend this gym, there staff is nothing but teenagers not qualified in sport medicine, the manager doesn't take responsibility for his employees lack of communication . The manager blames his employees. Sad, I canceled my membership they went headed and doubled charged my bank acct.which ones again the manager never notified me on the charges . Like I said lack of communication, it's run by teenagers. They don't even deserve one, there trainers aren't certified . BUYER BEWARE !!!!!",negative
"Not the greatest service. After getting a new job, I was unable to go to the gym again. Went in to cancel, had to wait 25 minutes just to speak to the manager. The manager was pushy & tried to offer me deals. I told him I couldn't not due to work. He gave me a gift card to the gym & thanked me. He brought other people to his desk to help.. kind of felt like we were being pushed to leave. I told him I still wanted to cancel!!! He said to call him then in an hour. I did. He answered & said he was with other customers. To check back later. Not a horrible gym but the Management service however.. thumbs down.",negative
when you ask them for help they give you dirty look no locker rooms day care in gym kids running through gym it's a cheap price that's about it don't waist your money,negative
Tough day at the gym. Been off my light yoga sequence for 2 weeks and how quickly you realize it takes months to improve flexibility and seconds to lose it. However for the 1st time I conducted my routine at this gym and I have to say they do a decent job of keeping the floors mopped. I've been coming here for couple weeks now and have to say the busy times are hard to determine it is always a surprise whether it will be busy or not. In general for what you are paying I have to say they do an ok job of keeping it clean. The staff is always very nice and friendly. Would love to see them add some plyo-boxes.,negative
Like I said in my previous review the gym itself was not the issue. The issue I did have has been resolved and I received a full credit of all charges they made to my card. Once I received a call from the manager it was handled immediately and I received a check within 2 days.,positive
"Gross, gross and gross. Although some staff members do take the time to clean the treadmills at times, they ignore everything else and I mean EVERYTHING else. Aside from the obvious; the equipment, take a look at the the floors, walls, mirrors, doors, ceiling fans, ductwork and bathrooms, D-I-S-G-U-S-T-I-N-G. Like everyone else who commented, this has been brought to the attention of the owner and he doesn't care. Drop a towel on the floor there? Pick it up with two fingers, immediately throw it out and then sanitize your hands with bleach. It's a shame because it's close, convenient and the front desk people are nice enough. Rule number one in any gym would be cleanliness, rule number two would be cleanliness and rule number three might be a combination of cleanliness and making sure the equipment is in proper working order. I gave it one star because if you have a rock solid immune system this could be the gym for you. If not, wait for the gym on Blue Diamond and Decatur to open next year.",negative
"I've been a gym rat since forever. I recently moved to the area from Los Angeles. Initially, I was skeptical, as the gym is really small. But it is the right size for this community, as it is small as well and not centrally located. The gym has everything you need, machines and free weights. Staff is friendly, gym is clean, and people who work out there seem to be drama free. There are just a few things that annoy me or would have been better: 1. A great deal of time, the men's room is out of paper towels. I think the staff should check that much more often and/or install an electrical hand dryer as well. 2. There are no showers there (I personally don't mind but some people may). There are changing rooms though. 3. There isn't a dedicated stretching/warmup area. Overall, for the price (I got $9.99 special) a month (plus yearly fee), it is good value.",positive
So accommodating when you signing up ! Different story when you want to cancel the membership ! You can sign up from any location but u HAVE TO. Cancel from where you signed up . You don't need a manager to sign up but you do when you want to stop!,negative
"This place is great. Home away from home. It's small, but never stopped me from doing what I'm doing. Employees are friendly, and machines that are broken are fixed within a day. I've been a member of Gold's and 24 hour, and this place is just as good. Not a ringing endorsement...? For $10 a month, waaaaaay better than the other two.",positive
"Best price around, not for people looking to stare at people while they're working out and more actual working out. Has everything you need if you're going to the gym to build. Does not have a Starbucks on site or a powder room for you little girls. Very nicely located in the heart of Southern Highland's. Great staff!",positive
By far the filthiest gym environment I've ever been in the equipment hasn't been wiped off in years and the high dusting is so thick and full of contaminants it's ridiculous for a place where people go to to try to get healthy to be put in a position to breathe such filthy air is just plain irresponsible I've brought it to the attention of management on more than one occasion and it falls on deaf ears Owners in upper management should be ashamed of themselves there is no excuse for how bad it is I get that it's a low-cost alternative but there's no excuse for filthy,negative
"I've been going to LVAC for 4 years, but I recently signed up here because it's closer to my house. It's got everything a gym should have: free weights, diverse machines, cardio equipment, core training accessories, TRX station, and more. It's somewhat small, but it's never TOO crowded. It can be a little busy at times, but most people are friendly and will let you work in or take note that you're waiting for equipment, as well. The only downside is that there's a lack of multiple pieces of the same equipment. I'll never give a gym 5 stars if they only have one squat rack.",positive
This is a perfect little gym. They have plenty of equipment and it's well maintained and clean. If your looking for a super sized meat market of a gym this is not for you. If you want to work out among lots of motivated people this is the gym for you!! The staff is really friendly here and they keep the gym clean. They also have a kids area but no space for classes like yoga or spin but still a great gym!!,positive
Terrible hours and way too small and therefore too busy. The opening hours are just ridiculous. Can't wait for another gym to open in this area.,negative
"No matter what everyone says, if you want a gym that nobody will bother you and stare at you, this is the spot. I'm there every Monday thru Friday at 445am and it's great. I'll admit in the afternoon like 5pm to 7pm it gets packed. But that tells you it's good place to go to. I have a personal trainer, Ana. She's been with me since day 1 of me starting here at the gym. This is actually my 1st time signing up for a membership. I've searched other place in town but they're either way too big, people are way too loud or in some cases staring at you. I highly recommend this place. Go see Ana, Cody, Tom or Brody if you want a difference in your life. Act Now! Seriously",positive
"I really like this gym and they recently added the stair mill which is awesome! My husband and I both work part time in order to be home with our son. This gym is in our budget and has free daycare. They are great at the daycare, it's very clean in there and they carried my son almost every time for a month until he got used to it. All the staff is great, it is small but you can't beat it for the price. I've lost 25lbs so far thanks to this gym.",positive
This is absolutely the dirtiest gym I've ever been in. It's always crowded and no one re racks their weights. The only reason for the 2 stars is the price but the longer I come the more I want to change because it's just so dirty,negative
"This is an amazing place. I have been going since October 2015, and love it. I have a trainer named Joe (evenings) and he is the best. I am a very large woman and because of him I have dropped 80 pounds and still going. Can not say enough great things about Joe and the gym. Tom the Manager is outstanding as well.",positive
"I called in for membership information and all the kid kept on saying if ""We can give you information over the phone, management has instructed us to have membership conversation over the phone"" are you *^&ing kidding!!!. Wake up!!! Like i really want to spend an hour onsite going over membership. Stupid policy. I was a member for 3 yr as i live 3 miles away from the gym, but i didn't review after i saw how unprofessional the staff was. Guess the owner should go back to St. Louis and refresh on customer service !",negative
"It's a little below average. Machines sometimes broke for over a week, and you deal with stuck up baller on budget people from southern highlands.",negative
I really enjoy this gym. It's close to my house and the staff is very friendly. It's a little bit small but they do have a childcare center which is a must for me. Joe is my trainer and he's amazing! He pushes me and even developed a meal plan for me. I highly recommend him as a personal trainer.,positive
"Small, overcrowded gym. Good luck using a bench or the single squat rack. Extremely rude staff. I moved to another state and they wouldn't let me cancel over the phone. Avoid this hole in the wall at all costs.",negative
While the location is convenient and the staff is friendly....the place is disgustingly filthy. I have been in sporadically over the past year and every time I hope for improvement but to be honest it just grosses me out. As nice as the staff is....they are lazy and should always be up and cleaning something....anything....I beg of you!,negative
"Pros: awesome people at the front desk. I am back in town for two months and needed a gym near by. They gave me a lower price than what they quoted me on the phone without me even asking. Cons: WAY too crowded. I really don't even have the words to explain how packed the place was. While I got a great deal, I just can't come back here. There are so many machines packed into this space that you can barely move around (which is my fault for not looking around before signing up, but still). No room whatsoever around the free weights to do any type of organized circuit because you are constantly moving out of the way and avoiding other people two inches from you. Maybe the issue was because I went at 6:00pm when everyone was getting off work, but there were so many people in that gym I couldn't even enjoy my workout. I'm sure it's not as packed early in the morning, but that just won't work for me. So I'll be eating my fee I paid for the two months and going elsewhere. Bummer.",negative
"I love this gym! It's so convenient and close to other stores I frequent often. The boys that work their are so cute and friendly and remember me when I come in. It never gets to busy and I always am able to use the machines I want. They don't have a locker room - but for $10/month I can't complain! It's always very clean and I often see the boys vaccuuming and cleaning the machines. If you need a gym to get busy in and not get distracted, this is the one for you!",positive
Not the biggest place to workout but I'm not trying to become Ahhnold either. It is quite cramped with all the equipment they have jammed in there but some kind of workout is better than no workout.,positive
"I love this gym for the ease of closeness, it's cleanliness and the bare essentials is has when I don't feel like making the trek all the way out to GV where my other gym is. This is great when you don't have much time and you need to get a quick work out in. Bare minimal gym for the serious trainer. The staff is also super friendly which keeps me coming back. I bought some training sessions but they were pretty worthless as I believe just about anyone could get certified and I didn't even break a sweat I let my last session just go because it was a waste of my time. Again, if you live in the area there are no contracts and monthy fees from 5-10 a month. Can't beat that. They don't have a stair master though which is why I have this a 3 review.",negative
I go to this gym 6 days a week at 5AM and I have also started going in the evenings as well at about 5-6PM it is pretty busy in the evening and you just need to get in where you fit in and get the workout you want and get out. In the morning you can pretty much move about freely and get your workout in pretty quickly before taking off. I like that it is a smaller gym and the morning crew is usually always the same people so you get used to who is there and they are all very conscious of etiquette and don't just take over a machine you are working on. The last but obvious key to this place is the price. It is CHEAP.. if you are wanting to get in shape and not break the bank just skip 2 lunches at McDonald's this month and your dues are paid.,positive
"It's a good neighborhood gym. Great for quick workouts. The staff is friendly and they are readily to assist clients with any questions. The facility has lockers, a children's playroom, a cardio section, a range of machines, and free weights. Defiantly recommend for all ages (well 13&up).",positive
"I have only been to Fitness 19 a few times but so far so good... One thing they forgot to tell me before signing up is the Kids Play room closes from 2-4... So i was a little bummed when i showed up there at 2:30 to work out, the guy that signed me up only said the Kids Play room was only closed on sundays. Its a really good deal and its super close to my house. They only have the basic work out equipment, nothing fancy and no pool or sauna, But i never use that stuff anyways!!",positive
"For the monthly price, well worth it. Lots of renovation has happened since I last came here, which is awesome. They have added new equipment since I last came here and lockers too. I was particularly looking for more leg equipment which they now have, bonus! It isn't the fanciest of equipment, but it gets the job done. Its the nearest gym facility in the Southwest area, so it is a pretty busy gym. I've been here early AM and late PM, and yup, still fairly busy. The gym etiquette here is good. Meaning, for the most part, people re-rack the weights, will ask if your done with the equipment, etc. That's almost hard to come by. It would be nice if they had some sanitizing wipes or something to spray down when people are done using the equipment, a suggestion I hope that will be implemented :)",positive
"Small, just small. No space on the floor to do non equipment workouts, closes early on weekends, not humid enough, I felt that painful cold air in my throat as I ran. Not enough space in the free weights section...maybe Its because I'm used to 24 hour fitness, but my workout didn't feel complete since I didn't get to relax my muscles in the sauna afterward.",negative
This fitness 19 is a family operated gym! Staff is really nice and the owner is friendly and knowledgeable. I dont go often cause I workout at the Henderson Fitness 19 gym. Keep up the good work,positive
"For a local gym Fitness 19 is as good as it gets. Very friendly staff starts with the owner Tom who makes you feel welcome as soon as you walk in. Even during peak times it isn't packed... only draw back is no sauna or steam room and very little locker space or changing area. But on the upside, it is very relaxed and several times I have lost gloves/headphones/ipod and everytime they are returned to the lost and found. Great neighborhood place!",positive
"Bob Lachniet, principal of the aforementioned retailer, is to be commended for his dedication to service and fair play. Confronted with an obstinate factory rep, Bob resolved the factory defect at his own cost. I have made three major purchases from Bob, all to my complete satisfaction. Stellar retailer...",positive
"Highly recommended, Jack provided great service and a great price. Jack even followed up several times to make sure there were no problems with the equipment. Probably the best service we ever received buying fitness equipment.",positive
"My husband and I are very satisfied customers of Fitness 4 Home. All of our work-out equipment comes from Fitness 4 Home, and we attribute our success in staying fit in great part to the excellent advice provided by manager, Jack Hinshaw, who helped us select the appropriate equipment to meet our needs. Gene Severino, M.D. and Carol Scarafiotti",positive
"Super service from Jack at this store. I got a solid deal, and the equipment recommendations have been terrific. The home gym i now have is better than a health club! Much better than the on line options in my opinion- I get piece of mind knowing that if I need adjustment, maintenance, etc it's down the street.",positive
"Great, knowledgable and organized staff, outstanding inventory, good prices. Purchased a nice package from them after another store was out of stock (a store which I only originally chose over this just because it was closer to work). To my surprise, they had PLENTY in stock at the set price the particular brand sells for. I was mainly helped by Eric, who is very knowledgable and customer-service oriented.",positive
"After many trips to Fitness4Home in Scottsdale I purchased the True M30. I was extremely pleased with how Kevin treated my family and me. Each time we stopped in he was very patient, helpful, and informative. The delivery and set up of my new machine went very smoothly. I love my M30 and because of the fantastic service I received from Kevin I would definitely send all of my friends to him.",positive
"Terrible, terrible.. I'm not even picky about my gym but the managers or just management is crap. No customer service skills. I've been having problems with my account and of course getting the run around every month.",negative
"It's not a perfect gym, but it's a great value if you get in during one of their many promo periods. The amenities are limited and the gym space is a bit cramped, but the location is great and the staff is good. If you're looking for fancy toys and to be seen, this isn't the place for you. If you want to get in and out for a workout close to home or the office for an affordable monthly rate, head here.",positive
"Not really sure what people are fussing about. It's a great gym. It has all the basics you need and a friendly staff. If you want a pool and a lot of hype go to the YMCA...for a higher $ too. Equipment is fine...newer than older. I hear the classes are nice. Tanning, showers, trainers...etc. Could use a facelift (lorckerrooms included) but other than that no complaints.",positive
"I used to love this gym until they started charging me for duplicate memberships. When you try to cancel they give you they run around between gym management and outside billing company (ABC financial). I've been back and forth for months, they say they will cancel membership then a charge shows up the next month. I've spent more time tracking down managers and billing agents then I ever did at the gym. Go anywhere else but to fitness connection. complete let down!",negative
"This club truly needs a facelift! Everything is old and outdated. I've visited their clubs in other areas, an this seems to be the worst one!",negative
"Unfortunately I was not really impressed with fitness connection, at least this one in particular. The one pro I did find were the classes that they offered. During my 5 day free pass that I only utilized 2 days of, I tried the body pump class and the cardio kickboxing class, both of which were awesome and had great instructors. They offered a few other classes that I didn't get the chance to try out but seemed like they would have been awesome too. So I signed up for the five day free pass and I was really excited because it's so close to my apartment and of course, because of the classes! But unfortunately this was more of a bother than a convenience. On the first day that I used the pass I had to fill something out real quick, not a big deal. I was then immediately asked to talk to someone after I was done with my class since I didn't have time before. I thought this was a little aggressive considering it was my first time here and first day using the pass so after class I didn't see the guy who waned to talk to me about membership and didn't have time to wait around. The next morning I received a phone call from the same guy asking me when I'd be in next, what day/time, class everything and if I could talk before or after. I said after. Again after didn't see anyone and wasn't waiting. At this rate I was already annoyed since they were being so aggressive and I barely used two days of my pass so I really didn't even get to experience a lot of the gym yet to make a decision on whether or not I wanted a membership. So after the second day I started receiving texts, phone calls, and emails about speaking to someone about the membership. I answered some I didn't answer others and I made it pretty clear that I would think about it and get back to them, and continued to get contacted. After the second day, I stopped going to fitness connection because of how clear I made it that I would think about it yet they continued to contact me. This is now at least a week later and I got another phone call today about extending my five day membership to seven days, I said I'm OK thanks and the person on the phone laughed and said OK with what? Again I think it's pretty clear that I was saying thanks but no thanks. I'm sorry but too in my face about a membership before even being able to feel it out for the first 5 days. On top of that, just wasn't my scene. It was a big, little gym. There is a lot of equipment stuffed into the gym, kind of on top of each other. Too close to one another for my liking. I'll stick to the gym in my apartment complex and the current gym I have a membership with.",negative
"About what you would expect. They are slowly improving, but ramping up memberships exponentially at the same time. Very crowded during peak times, but to be expected. The bigger issue is attention to detail: their are almost no ab balls, and the ones which do exist are either flat or being used in the ""personal training only areas"". Jump ropes disappear, not enough cable machine carabiners to attach all of the cables to pull handles at one time, etc. Small gym staples which are cheap to purchase and should be monitored and maintained.",negative
"Good for a basic work out. I work out 1st thing in the AM and never have to wait for an elliptical, bike, or stair climber. It gets the workout covered. However, this place needs to clean up their facilities. The shower, restrooms, and changing rooms are not regularly cleaned. You can come every weekday and see the same mark on a shower stall, piece, hair on the floor, etc..for days on end. Ugh! Gross! Wear your shower shoes and bring scrubbing bubbles with you. Cause this cheap place ain t cleaning up. MRSA, VRE, and athletes foot love this place.",negative
"Fitness Connection has been a terrible experience. I was only a member for 1 month and in that time frame came a great load of disappointments. None of the staff seemed to every know what was going on. Upon signing up, we were told there were bootcamp classes there three times a week when come to find out bootcamp is actually offered once a week at the location. I was consistently misinformed by staff about policies and procedures clearly they knew nothing about including services offered, cancelation policy, and how to actually go about canceling your account. I tried to cancel my policy within the 30 days notice and was told I had to come in to cancel when in fact was informed by the billing company that I can cancel online. Fit Connection then tried to bill me for another month because I was not within the 30 day cancellation policy. Trying to get this situation taken care of was an absolute nightmare. I am a very patient and understanding person when it comes to these types of things. The only other company I can't stand is HH Gregg due to terrible customer service as well. No one could even tell me who I needed to contact or give me a correct contact number. It took me 6 people and two days to get to the right one. I emailed her and requested a call due to my concerns. She emailed me and said I waived the fee and that was it. Thank you for waving the unnecessary fee but how about some concern and gusto to fix the pieces of your company that I had a problem with in the first place. Absolutely terrible experience!",negative
"Normally I would consider myself a very patient person with poor customer service, especially after working in the restaurant/hospitality industries previously, but Fitness Connection has been just plain awful. I initially planned to check out Fitness Connection because they offered a free 5 day trial and were located in Uptown near to my office I'm working at this summer. Turns out that to not be charged a much larger sign up fee you have to sign up and put a down payment that you can cancel within 5 days to avoid charges. Ok, no big deal. I went to the gym twice: facilities were okay but somewhat crowded, and the gym was less convenient to the office than I expected, so I decided I didn't want to spend $20-30 per month over the summer when I have other options. I came in on the third day and cancelled my membership, received a confirmation email cancellation, and was told I would be refunded my $60 down payment and first month payment. After 2 weeks I received no refund so I called Fitness Connection and was told I would have to talk to the third party organization that handles their transactions. After 2 weeks and multiple calls with the third party, it turns out that Fitness Connection directly billed me because it was my down payment, so I would have to seek a refund directly from them. So, I called Fitness Connection, explained my situation to the manager at the time and was told he would call corporate and email/call me back with the next steps. After a week..no new information so I gave them another call and was told the same thing and that I ""should"" receive a refund in 3-5 days. So all in all, I signed up for a ""free 5 day trial"", have had to make at least 10 calls to Fitness Connection and their finance partner, and have still not received my $60 refund for using their facilities twice. Also during the two times I worked out at the gym, I have never been more pressured to sign up for personal training, buy all their supplements, and get everything Fitness Connection that I could. As a few others have said, the clientele were mainly guys looking to get big upper bodies and not worry about legs, definitely not a place I'd want to go if you're looking to train for compound lifts without the classic bro trying to steal your bench as you grab water.",negative
"I had been a member of the uptown fitness connection for about 2 years and joined under the GM, Stephens leadership.. Great guy! BUT.. the new GM Skip Arbuckle is a trip.. He thinks hes got some power as the GM and flexes it when possible. On May 3 I went to CNXl my membership as I will be moving from the state. I then received an email from ABC financial that I was due to pay one more month as I was out of the 30 day cancelation policy. They directed me to the store level where I met Mr Arbuckle. I explained to him that I was moving and wouldnt need the gyms service any longer. I ask him to CNXL my membership and to give me a paper copy of my cancelation and he refused. He ask me to leave the club and threatened to call the police. I of course stood and waited for the police. I still havent been given any form of the cancelation. Lets face it.. the gym is in a convienient location if you live uptown. Its cheap.. $10 a month 20 if you tan but listen. My dad always says, ""you get what you pay for"". Spend a few more bucks and go to a beter facility. This gym is filthy, crowded and of course.. Poor Customer Service!",negative
"Reasonably priced gym but not worth the moderate monthly cost - here's why: 1. Very crowded facility swarming with personal trainers at all hours 2. Strong pressure to sign-up for training services 3. I decided to try these out and had a poor experience: A. Three different trainers in six months of training. None of them talked to each other, none of them transitioned training plans, and only one of them spent the time to correct form, advise on exercises, etc. - which is the main reason someone would want to use a trainer 4. The final trainer I had was an incredibly poor experience. Zero personal attention, she was unable to track our appointments (I had to follow-up to confirm if a training session had been moved or not, I received passive-aggressive texts asking why I missed an appointment when I was out of town and didn't have a session scheduled, etc.), and a weak understanding of exercise science in general. If you want a cheap gym, go for it, but be prepared for crowds and trainers overrunning most areas. This is a facility designed to sell training services more than a stand-alone gym.",negative
"Can't say enought about the personal training I am receiving at Fitness Connect on Morehead. The sign up process was smooth and there were a lot of options to choose from to meet my financial needs. I had an injury with my arm and Alex paired me with a personal trainer who specializes in injuries. Mania, my trainer is awsome! He is a true professional. In his manner, his knowledge and his ability to communicate. My arm no longer hurts and I am on the way to being in the best shape I have been in for years. I recommend the personal training at Fitness Connect with a 5 star score!",positive
"I usually train at the Ballantyne location because it was minutes from my work. Mon-Wed it can get a little crowded but never enough where it limits your workout. I have no complaints really except that (like all Fitness Connections) they play the same crap music over and over again all day AND although they say they're open 24 hrs.....well, they're not. As for the Uptown location, I have heard from numerous people that its impossible to get a solid workout in after 5 during the week so I haven't even attempted to do so or had the need since Ballantyne was more convenient... I'm only on this side of town on the weekends so Saturday is the only time I frequent this particular location. This gym is extremely diminutive in size and even on some sat mornings I find it almost impossible to get done what I want to get done. Being that its January the crowd problem is further exemplified with new years resolutionists all with bad form and clueless looks on their faces as they mope around trying to figure out what they're doing just so they can quit by February. Since I'm no longer working in Ballantyne and moving closer to the uptown area in a couple weeks this place is really going to be my only option besides South Blvd (super ghetto). Horrible. I can't wait to no longer be a member..",negative
I go to both the uptown and South Park location and I am very happy. Let's talk about what this gym is and what it isn't. This gym is for people who like to lift weights it is not for the weekend yoga person or for the person who likes to swim laps at a pool. After getting fed up with the Y being overcrowded and over priced I joined FC. The price can't be beat and I find the vibe at the gym motivating. People are working hard there. The only thing they are missing is the traditional elliptical machines. But they have plenty of treadmills and the cross country skiing eelliptical machines. Both locations are cleaner than the Dowd and Harris Y. I don't understand why people have rated this low.. I have worked out all over the country in all the chains you can think of. For the price you are paying it is a good value.,positive
"Imagine all the negative stereotypes you have of a gym: overcrowding, lots of 'nightclub' lifters with big upper bodies and no legs, people jumping on equipment in the middle of your set, a see & be seen clientele (girls in makeup, etc) and did I mention the crowds? Well this place has them all. It's really quite a pain in the ass kind of place. I've been lifting for a very long time (I've done bodybuilding shows) and I travel extensively for work, so I've seen all kinds of gyms- high end, blue collar, city locations, country settings, chains as well as independents and I can tell you that of them all, I like this gym least. Why? Because they oversell their membership and they don't fully train their front office staff to handle the basic things (out of town day passes, updating credit cards, signing people into group fitness classes, the concept of first come first serve). My check in process took WAY LONGER than what the situation required (about 15 minutes). When it was obvious that the check-in girl was new, I offered to sign in and deal with their nonsense on my way out, but no-- she'd rather make me suffer the pains of her confusion. May I recommend better employee training. Obviously it's not all bad... they are in a good uptown location, they have a fair amount of free parking, they are right next to the rail line and from what I understand, their monthly dues are cheap (thus the crowds). If you're a twenty-something urbanite who likes to prowl for dates at a fitness club, then I guess this is a good spot for you. I'm at a different stage of life, I guess. If I lived here I would just pay extra for the much nicer Gold's Gym nearby.",negative
"Until recently, I was a huge fan of Fitness Connection--the prices are reasonable, the hours good, and the space inviting. The equipment is in good condition, and I rarely had to wait for machines. The major downfall--and the reason I hope this company goes out of business--is customer service. When I first signed up for the gym, I told agent that I'd be moving in a few months and wanted to cancel my membership then. She replied that there would be no problem and that I should cancel my membership closer to the date. Why couldn't I just take care of it now? I didn't argue, just said okay. Periodically, I checked it to make sure I hadn't missed my membership cancellation deadline. My desire to cancel was always clear, but the response I always got was to remind them closer to the date. Well, I left town for a holiday weekend. The next week, I again asked to cancel my membership so as not to pay for an extra month. Your deadline has passed, they told me, and there's nothing we can do. I had made it clear that I wanted to cancel my membership for over a month! Each time they told me to do it later. And all of a sudden, they tell me I missed the deadline! Fitness Connection made it impossible for me to cancel my membership in a timely manner by refusing to accept notice, plain and simple. The last straw was when I tried to bring my dad to the gym as a guest. They wouldn't let him in because he didn't have an ID with him, something about liability insurance. Fine. Annoying, but fine. BUT if I paid $10, they'd let him in without presenting an ID. Somehow, paying them money suddenly made the liability issue vanish. STAY AWAY FROM THIS COMPANY! You can find plenty of gyms that are just as nice and that don't take advantage of customers. It's time to put Fitness Connection out of business.",negative
"Not bad for the money. I went to the Uptown location for a couple of years because I worked in the same building so it was super convenient. There were times where the place was packed and I ended up leaving because there were no available machines. They have a nice variety of fitness classes as well, but those can ridiculously full, to the point where it becomes a safety issue (once during a Group Power class I almost hit another person in the head with my barbell, we were that close). I eventually stopped going to that location for one simple reason. The A/C. There were times I started sweating from just walking in the place. And there's nothing management can do about it (believe me, I know plenty of people who have complained about it). Now I go to the location on South Boulevard. The place is so much bigger than the Uptown location. It's also much cooler. My only complaint is that the room where they hold the classes has windows on one side that look out into the rest of the gym. Not something I'm crazy about when I looked like a beached whale while trying to do Zumba.",negative
"Been a member for about 3 months now and so far so good. The gym is $20 a month so really can't beat that - there's a membership fee at the start but make sure to haggle with them as I had my fee knocked down to $29! Classes come with the gym as well but I just haven't checked them out yet. I hit up the Uptown location which has always been clean whenever I go. This location tends to get busy, especially after work, but I've actually never had an issue getting a treadmill or the glider machine - plenty of equipment at this location. One downside is the machines don't have TVs - small complaint but hey, TV distracts me and makes me stay longer. The hours on the weekends are short, closing at 5 - booooo. And as a heads up, the Uptown gym does have free parking in the parking garage beside it except on home Panthers game... then you have to pay $10 to park... but really, who chooses gym over tailgating?! Update to review: new extended hours! Awesome sauce.",positive
"My boyfriend and I were members here for a long time. We both ended our membership several months ago. Somehow my cancellation turned into a huge nightmare and I ended up paying an extra $190 over the contract agreement. even though I only signed up for a year and fufilled my original contact, they wanted me to fax in all these different things to cancel. Their Corporate office sent a ""we miss you, come back"" 5 days pass. My boyfriend used it for 2 days, then the management at this location refused to let him redeem the other 3 days, even though he had been a paying member for 3 years prior and was on the fence about rejoining. This wasn't a pass he clipped out of a magazine. Their CORPORATE OFFICE mailed it directly to him. Poor customer service. There are too many other places to work out for this place to get our return business.",negative
"I've been a member for about 6 months now and am enjoying it very much. Classes are great, although there are many offered only during the day that I would like to try, but can only take classes after work. The cardio machines get very crowded at peak times but I can usually find something to do. Uptown location is a bit smaller but South Blvd location has a little more space. Very much enjoy group power, yoga, and cycling classes through the group fitness. Bathrooms aren't always the cleanest they could be but overall very happy with membership.",positive
"I've been a member here for a little over a year and it's been a good experience overall. I pay the $14.99/month fee (I had to pay a $45 initial fee as well though) and find it to be a good deal. It's kind of a small place being in an office building, but it has everything that I need as far as weightlifting and cardio. They just got new equipment about a year ago, so everything is good shape for the most part. That's a plus. I would suggest avoiding the after work time between 5-7pm on weekdays as it gets crowded! Luckily my job allows me flexibility to come in the middle of the morning or afternoon, so I rarely have any issues.",negative
"Liked this facility until I had a bad experience w another member. I go to the gym and mind my own business, always. Out of nowhere some loser I've never seen makes a very inappropriate gesture to me. Since then he still disgusts me. It's really too bad this gym is attracting that type of clientele. Look out for the ugly guy in the black beater. Im prob going to find a new gym to go to. This type of nonsense is just uncalled for to say the least.",negative
"Terrible gym, facilities, rude customer service and the group fitness is awful! The ""South Park"" Gym is actually on South Boulevard a pretty far cry from South Park. Unfortunately or fortunately I was injured and had a medical excuse not to be a member anymore, but they would not accept it! I have gone back and forth with them even though it is in my contract that if you have a medical excuse you will be canceled. I dealt with their customer service through ABC financial and they don't care about you. Then I called the corporate office and they were also very rude and the customer service person named Rebecca told me I was selfish and hung up on me. Customer service at it's best at Sports and Firtness. This place is seriously ruthless. It is pretty pathetic how they really need that $20 a month and don't care about their reputation. Save your time and money and don't get stuck in the stupid contract.",negative
"There aren't very many amenities, it's very crowded during peak times, not open very late on weekends but at $20 a month you can't really complain. Staff are friendly, machines always work, and everyone is pretty respectful about wiping down their machines and not taking too long if they know you are waiting. They tried to push the personal training on me, but I said no and they dropped it.",positive
"After the constant harassment from here I have to downgrade this to 1 star. How can military orders not be accept for a valid excuse to cancel the membership? I DONT EVEN LIVE IN CHARLOTTE ANYMORE! **Update** After over a month of going back and forth, my account is now cancelled effective August 16, 2012. Somehow their 30 cancellation notice turned into 90 days.",negative
"My membership began with a phone call to the Sports and Fitness Club. The recruiter had offered me a great deal. $1 to sign up and the first month is free. So I ran down to join and right at the end of all of the paperwork he wanted me to pay $50 to sign up. What a scam. I was so upset I should not have signed up. I was actually arguing with them while I was joining. So on the day I first worked out I noticed they have a woman cleaning the mens locker room which was strange to get used to. Then, my girlfriend's card was declined so we were charged $15 each for that issue which really upset me. I was under the impression that if you have no contract, then there is no obligation. DO NOT ASSUME THIS. So I was fed up and wanted to cancel. Yet there is more obligation that I was unaware of. You can't just quit at Sports and Fitness. You are required to pay for an additional month of membership. Their excuse is that they are processing the membership cancelation. I tried so hard calling their financial agency (whom by the way, is not Sports and Fitness) and they would not give me a break at all. So just assume that whatever they tell you at sign up, is not the full truth, and may even be lies. You really can't expect much from a gym that charges $20 except for things that are cheap.",negative
"For the price, you can't beat it - $20 a month to go to any location, classes included? Heck yeh! So why not 5 stars? I'm glad you asked! - there is no towel service, nor amenities should you need to shower, which is a bit of a bummer (I sweat. I'd like to shower, to alleviate that) - at peak times, they can get awfully crowded - I kinda wish there was a little more consistency in the operating hours between locations (one location might be 24 hours M-Saturday, and another might close at 6 pm during the week) - Staff doesn't always seem up to speed on what's going on in the location (example: this week, I attended a class that was listed on the white board as being led by what is clearly a man's name, and when I got into class, the teacher was clearly not a guy. When I inquired at the front desk after class as to who taught the class, they looked at the white board and relayed the guy's name to me. No one seemed to know who the mystery teacher was) Then again: it's $20 a month, so I can't really complain too much when the equipment is new, in good repair, and the class variety is pretty sweet. I've loved my membership and definitely get my money's worth. (The image is the Morehead Street/ Downtown location)",positive
"I thought this place would be great because the facility is clean and theres alot of machines, the problem lies with the managers pushing the personal training on you. I told them that I wasnt sure if I would be around enough since I travel constantly and am rarely home which is why I signed up for the month to month plan, finally I relented and signed up for twice a month personal training, under the impression that it was another month to month deal. As planned, I left town for 2 months and tried to call to adjust my personal training, it took me a week and a half to even get a hold of a manager to talk to, and when I finally did I was given 3 different phone numbers and finally an email to talk to someone. After I called and left a voicemail with the woman in charge, I recieved an email telling me that i'd still be charged for the coming month and that I'd be charged with 25% of the remaining fees for the personal training I had not used yet for the rest of the year. NEVER was I told I was being put into a contract like this and after I explained to the woman that I was never told that I was being bound into a year long contract she still did not reply. DO NOT GO TO THIS GYM THEY HAVE UNETHICAL BUSINESS PRACTICES",negative
"I was a member of the Sports and Fitness Club in Ballantyne for two years. It was actually a Peak Fitness when I first became a member there. It's the only location that I have ever worked out at and the building is only a few years old. For the most part they took pretty good care of the equipment and did their best to keep things working. I will say that this gym is very busy due to the low monthly pricing. Make sure you read any fine print because at those low prices they were charging a membership fee once a year of approx. $30 or so. Since this gym is used so much it does kind of have that odor and feel of a 'dirty gym' at times but I did see them cleaning a lot. I'm not 100% sure that a lot of the people using the machines were cleaning after themselves. Shame on them! Another sign was the wear and soiled carpet going in and out of the restrooms. Again this is probably to be expected in a gym with high traffic. It's not at all a bad place to workout, and for the price I guess you can't complain!",negative
"I just joined Fitness Connection (FC) last year while living in Charlotte. JOINING and PRICING: I will say, it was easy to get a 5 day pass online and come in for a workout. The sales team is standardly sales for the industry - a tour of the facility, talking about your goals, and then finally a visit to their office where you discuss pricing options. Having worked in rmany gyms before, I knew the drill. Basically, you're going to pay an ""enrollment fee"" most of the time, from $100-$200. I wasn't interested in this and the manager overheard me mention my history of working in gyms and offered me a $49 enrollment fee. Still not great but certainly better than $200. If you can join during a special, I'd advise doing so for a reduced or eliminated enrolling fee. Don't be pressured by their ""today only"" deals and be willing to walk away (to me, joining a gym is a bit like buying a car - the fees are a bit ridiculous and always negotiable if you do it right). There are no contracts and a 30-day cancellation policy, which is outlined when you join. Memberships range from $9.99 to $19.99 per month, depending on if you wish to use multiple locations and want to bring a guest. This FC has child care as well (never used it). Hours are good throughout the week - this facility is open early and closes late but others are open 24/7. When I joined, I went for the cheapest option as I don't intend to use multiple facilities and generally workout alone. This location does not offer towels or towel service; I came from a Golds and was use to this but I know this can be a deal breaker for some. THE EXPERIENCE: For $10/month, I have found that Fitness Connection offers everything I need at a good price - definitely better than a Planet Fitness. It's cheaper than a Y over time and certainly not as busy, though I haven't been to FC past 5PM so I can't speak to the end of day busy time. People are generally pretty nice, and there aren't a lot of stereotypical meatheads or body builders. It's a good place for people with all kinds of fitness goals. The actual facility itself, as I said, has everything I was looking for. There is a mix of new and older cardio equipment from stairmasters to AMTs and treadmills. I've never seen them all utilized at once and they seem to be in generally good shape. There are also two areas for weight lifting including selectorized machines, plate loaded machines, a deadlifting platform, smith machine, squat rack x2, and benches. Much like the cardio, these pieces seem to be a mix of old and new. Some are missing pins and occasionally I've needed to track down plates, but they're not in awful disrepair. I'm more often annoyed that no one seems to re-rack their weights (but I can't fault FC staff for this). In addition to cardio and weights, FC offers an indoor track, personal training, TRX training, and group exercise and spin studios with multiple classes. Other locations also have pools and sport courts, if that's something you're interested in. THE FACILITY: I'd like to point out that the location certainly isn't in South Park, even though the name implies it. This location is near South and Tyvola. Not inconvenient for me, but also definitely not in South Park. Like I said, the facility itself is large and open. I've never had an issue with crowding despite going different times in the morning and afternoon. I enjoy the layout and think it works well. I have used the locker rooms multiple times and although the women's locker room is a weird layout (there are ellipticals in there?), it's not awful. There's a dry sauna as well as full showers, mirrors, and changing rooms. The lockers are a good size and fit my very full backpack. One point I will harp on is the general cleanliness of the building. Every time I'm there, I've seen a member of staff cleaning or taking care of trash. It's nice to see, but I'm not quite sure how thorough their cleaning regime actually is. I've never seen them cleaning the machines, and though you're encouraged to wipe them down after use it would be even nicer to see staff cleaning them. Additionally, the floors are usually pretty dirty (especially in the locker rooms - lots of hair everywhere) even early in the morning, and it appears the mirrors throughout the building aren't cleaned very frequently either. More importantly are the bugs. In less than two weeks I've seen cockroaches in multiple areas of the gym, from the fitness floor to the locker room. One remained on the floor every day for three days. I've spoken to management about it, and they have let me know they're aware of it and recently sprayed, but it's still concerning. Where there's one, there's more. Overall, it's a good gym if you're willing to bring your own towel and don't pay close attention to the cleanliness. I knew what I wanted when I joined and this beat the Y in terms of price, location, and amenities. Just wish it was cleaner!",positive
"Poor maintenance of the facility's. Locker rooms dirty, showers and shower curtains covered in mold, walls crumbling, still no internet in 2018 even though the info scroller at the bottom of the tv channels all say they have internet. Studio space restricted to classes only even when not in use. ""Stretching area"" on main floor is very small and crammed with equipment like a giant punching bag, gravity straps, and other equipment, this area will accommodate maybe 3 people with a passive excercise routine. Club management just seems to shrug and pass the responsibility off on the corporate office. Don't waste your money here.",negative
"The gym is not bad. The equipment needs some updating but it gets the job done.The reason for my 1 star review is b/c of my personal training experience. A really nice guy named Phillip Oglesby signed me up 6 month program made up of 1 workout session per week and diet plan. I was so excited, Josh handled my workout program and he was amazing. Phillip handled my diet plan and that were things went bad. For the first 3 months he never provided me a diet plan. I asked about my diet plan during that 3 month period a handful of times when i saw him at the gym and he always said he would get on it right away but it never happened until I sent an upset email to him wanting to cancel the diet portion of my contract. Then we spoke at the gym and all he had to say was ""I am so sorry I forgot"" and I was like so am I still going to get charged for the diet portion of my contract and he said ""I'm sorry there are no refunds"". Then he said ""Josh will handle my diet from now on."" Josh provided me my diet plan and nutrition advise but I was already over it. I stuck with the program b/c I was stuck paying for it either way and Josh did provide me with some great work outs and nutrition advise. I would not recommend a training program with this location, due to customer service.",negative
"Meh. Eh. I go here, but I got spoiled by the nicer locations. The new Ballantyne location got SO many upgrades, that now I feel spoiled. This South Blvd location is fine. It has the machines that you want, and the weird machines that move your whole body when you use them. It's got two squat racks, a deadlift area, and a ton of benches. It also has the smallest track that I've ever seen, it surrounds the group fitness and cycling rooms. The staff told me that they will be getting upgrades eventually, so that's hopeful? The other locations have free wi-fi, newer equipment and a larger variety of machines and weights. But the South Blvd location really is fine, and it gets the job done. I took 10 mins of a cycle class here and wasn't into it, I walked out (because again, I'm spoiled). I have yet to take a group fitness class, I've never seen one going on while I was there. It is an a-ok gym. Stick to what you know, don't get ""new ways to use the weigh machines"" ideas from pinterest, re-rack your weights, and it'll be fine.",negative
"I have taken the MixxFit and BodyPump classes with LaToya and Patrica. They are both amazing, energetic and great instructors. Even when first starting to class I never felt lost. Would highly recommend both them and their classes.",positive
"Don't get PT sessions unless you have a healthy body and no reason to ever cancel!!! If you do want PT sessions make sure you tell them the day you sign up you want to cancel, because there is no trial period. You will be billed for two months regardless at $40 a session ($320). There's a 30 day cancellation process right off the bat. Oh, if you want to cancel, make sure you don't tell your trainer, call the main office directly. The trainer (ALEX) will make you feel like you can finish the month out that you've paid for and see if you want to keep training or not, but he won't pass your cancellation request up to the only person that will handle your account (AJ) because he wants to get that extra month of pay. And the trainers won't remind you that only AJ can handle your request. And the trainers won't own their mistake and pay for the month the allowed you to RE-up on. They screwed my girlfriend over just as I described above and she has to quit PT due to an upcoming shoulder surgery. So be careful trusting these trainers with your wallet. She just wanted to try it out to see if it would help her fitness goals, but they have a more permanent motive in mind. Bathrooms are clean and you don't have to share equipment too often...but if you can't trust their financial ethics, then what's the point? There's other gyms in the area that will treat your wallet better. IE: Crossfit. They will cancel on the spot and prorate what part of the month you used. That's where I go. I went to this gym with my gf numerous times just for support and the fun of working out together. But gyms like Crossfit will respect you and your wallet and not lock you in to contracts you were aware of or tell you your good to cancel when you not. Keep it in mind.",negative
"Here is an update to the review I gave a couple days ago. A few pieces of equipment were still ""under repair"" today. For the smith machine one of the pegs that holds the bar was missing in one of the most used heights/levels. And the cable machine still had a sign signifying it's ""coming"" repair. As you can imagine my frustration at only one cable machine available and it being probably one of the most used items in there. I mean what exactly is my membership paying for? So I went to the front desk to remind them to please have these items fixed and I received nothing but concern and professionalism. AJ greeted me as soon as I approached the desk even with other patrons in line. He listened to the issue and told me he would get right on it. Not only did he go check the equipment out but he took it upon himself to help fix the smith machine right away. And he even followed up with me apologizing for my inconvenience and letting me know he would call maintenance asap. I'm writing this review because yes this gym gets a bad rep for being older, having older equipment, or looking outdated/messy BUT they are improving their equipment and at least one staff member there gives a fuck! Thank you AJ! I'll see you tomorrow!",positive
I've attended the various fitness connections across Charlotte and this location is my least favorite. It is very old and doesn't seem clean at all. This gym could definitely benefit from some maintenance.,negative
"Normally I don't write reviews unless I have a really great experience or a really bad experience. In this case, its the latter. This gym is obviously poorly managed. Some of the equipment is falling apart and has been out of order for weeks without repair. NOBODY re-racks their weights. There are dumbbells and plates everywhere. It can be really hard to find the plates you are looking for because they are just scattered everywhere throughout the gym. People generally don't wipe off the machines or benches after they are done using them. This place is really a mess. At the end of the night when the gym is about to close, the staff don't put anything back, they just leave it a disaster for the next morning. The price of this gym is pretty good, but it is not worth it. Pay the extra $20 a month to go somewhere that you can actually enjoy your workout. When I went to sign up for a membership, the person I worked with actually lied to me and said that they did not offer one of the memberships that was on their website. I showed it to them and had to sit in the gym and sign up on my phone to get the price I wanted. They were going to charge me a $200 startup fee, when the fee on the website was only $60. I already got a membership somewhere else and won't be going back to Fitness Connection hopefully ever again.",negative
"Appears to have older equipment but beware if you are from out of own as their daily rate is $15, about 3X as much as other places including YMCAs or crossfits.",negative
"This gym is terrifyingly weird. Sooo old. Equipment, bathrooms, group rooms were in pretty bad shape. Terrible layout. Air condition was broken during the class I went to. All kinds of people in your way since the layout is so cramped. 20 people lunging at the same time across the whole gym. I'm sorry but what a gross place. Can't think of any positives except for the fitness manager seems really nice.",negative
"After a year long membership here, I decided to not stay. Worst gym in Las Vegas. Last summer, the air conditioner wasn't working and I sweated my asshole off. Sweat was all over the floor. Huge roaches crawling in the shower and they never clean. Gotta love showering with huge bugs. The cardio equipment doesn't work properly and they won't fix it. All of the equipment is very old and the weight machines are either broken or clogged up. Back in April, the entire back row of treadmills were flooded out because the roof was leaking. Corporate and management does not care about complaints. This gym is primarily for grunters. If you like to drop the free weights, grunt, bring a gallon of water,and watch lunkers then it's the perfect gym for you. Nothing like running on a treadmill underwater while someone screams"" rawr"" Fun times at fitness for the lunkers !!! At 10 dollars a month, you can't beat the entertainment and you never know when the roof will leak. Swimming pool right on the cardio equipment. Heck yeah!!!!",negative
"ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS GYM! Worked out here for a few months until i had to cancel my membership because i moved. However this gym is great, friendly staff, not crowded and always clean.",positive
"This gym is great. Always come once I get off work, even the staff are great. The thing I like about this gym it's not crowded like how other gyms are. The good thing about it it's close from where I live so that's a big thumbs up for me.",positive
"I used to love coming here back in 2009-2011, even though corporate had no idea (and still doesn't) what it takes to run a gym properly. It was empty, the staff (especially Cecilia) was excellent. New management and corporate doesn't take complaints seriously. They don't take care of their employees, they definitely don't care about their members, and they could care less about their club. It's becoming crowded and I'm usually being leered at by some perv (the manager, David, is also a perv). Speaking of the manager, I've seen him get in guests' faces and yell at them. Blame them for the incompetency of his own doing. He never takes responsibility for problems and blames other employees or guests. He has no sense of behaving properly as a manager. The only upgrade to the whole place has come with the addition of Dawn offering a lot of dance/fitness classes. They also fixed the air, but if it's close to 110 outside, it's going to be around 85+ in the gym. The bathrooms in the women's locker room tend to be gross and I've heard from some of the other members that the showers are also gross. My boyfriend also has said that the men's locker room is pretty disgusting most of the time. Other than that, it's okay and you're able to get a pretty good workout if you aren't waiting because someone is taking a half hour on a machine or bench just sitting on their phones or taking selfies.",negative
"Before I joined this gym about 8 months ago I read the reviews on Yelp. The reviews compare this gym to the Country Atlethic Club or the Mega Gyms which isnt fair. Its like comparing Spirit Airlines to First Class on an international flight. With that said its a great gym if you live close by. I stop by on my way home from work. They have a tanning room, aerobic room (zumba m-f), a cardio room with 24 treadmills and about 15 elliptical machines, a fitness ball room with mats, the dumbbell area, more weight and cardio machines in the main area and a rock climbing wall. The gym is full mirrored for the muscle heads. What I like most is the ease of getting in and out. Everyone is just chill here. No chics in silly make up or guys grunting. They have tvs near the treadmills and bike area. The hours are reasonable...mostly 5-11 or 7-9 on the weekends. Ive been to 24 and that place was over whelming and 24 hour fitness is too expensive. They lose a star because the towel and soap dispenser in the locker room is always broke. Why is it automated? Just put them in a stack on the counter. The world will move on. Oh, it is only $10 a month and something like a $35 admin fee that they charge around the 3rd month. Its well worth it.",positive
Ive been a member since October 2013. The gym is pretty basic. Gets the job done never really crowded or creepy! Makes working out more enjoyable. They also offer tanning included w most memeberships.,positive
"was stuck on giving them a 2 star or 3 but I guess minus the crappy hrs the gym is quite decent. working 10 hr shifts makes it tough to work out here debating on switching to planet fitness same price only 24 hrs this gym has everything you need really bench, squat rack, smith machine leg press...etc I do wish they had a rack with curl bars of different weights. they have great cardio machines and plenty of them. this gym has everything you need plus more for $10 no contract what more do you want",negative
Great place to work out for those who really work out. Old Gold Gym and still has all the weights I need. LVAC is nice but the parking and crowds are BAD. This place I walk and and work out with little to no wait. Staff is friendly.,positive
"My husband has been coming here for 5 months and had been getting me to go. I finally decided to come as a guest last week and the first impression was really really bad. I tried out their treadmill and that section was not only poorly lighted, but every machine I looked at was beyond disgusting and dirty. It looked like the machines haven't been cleaned in months and there were used tissues laying in the water bottle holders... Eeeek!!! Also if your planning on having a guest come with you and [visit] the gym be prepared to pony up $5 for each visit, which I think is silly. You have to pay $5 just to check out the gym and without any staff to walk you around and show you the ropes or give you insight on what the gym offers? Give me a break... All these things combined made for a very poor first impression and I frankly rather dish out $15 or $20 a month to have a clean and professional gym.",negative
"I love this gym, relatively speaking though. This gym is cheap! Only 4 people are there whenever I used to go there! The poor lighting and the atmosphere felt insanely depressing. I specifically went to this gym to simply focus on lifting weights with no wait and no attractive women to distract me. The last thing I want to do is get a hard-on during a bench press. KIDDING! Well, sorta.",negative
"Good: Most machines and free weights you need to work out Cheaper per month than most 1 meal buffets lots of members look scary - makes you want to work out harder lots of members look dangerous - makes you want to work out harder great location off Sahara, close to Food 4 less - workout & eat cheap. Minimal to no wait for equipment Bad: Looks frightful and unpleasant everywhere (workout areas, lockers, bathrooms) No water stuff - sauna, pool, jacuzzi. For just $22 a month now days I can get Vegas Athletic Club membership for much better amenities, pleasant and environment to workout at. Come on, extra $12 a month? If you can't afford extra $12 a month, you can buy a 5 gallon bottle of water and use it as your in-home gym. Save $10 a month! I'll stick to this club for now. I like the rugged horrid look it has. Makes me feel more manly.",negative
"I canceled my membership and they pulled $60 out of my account due to an error that they had after switching from fitness works to youfit. They said they would refund my money, but they didn't and I had to file a fraud claim with my credit union.",negative
"This is by far the worst gym I have ever been to. I am a veteran and I have seen places in third world countries nicer than this place. The machines never work, the gym is an absolute pigsty, and the staff could use a refresher on proper etiquette and manners. I signed up and it's supposed to be a 10 dollar membership and I was charged 80 dollars in the first month! I calmly confronted the staff and I got attitude and a 1-800 number. Staff don't want to build relationship with the people trying to change their lives A 1 Star review is giving this place a little too much. Avoid at all cost and go to LA Fitness, Planet Fitness, or even your home gym in better than this chain!",negative
Horrible gym they have old equipment and charge you $40 a year because they buy new equipment that is a lie they have old rusty equipment which they charge 1 month after you start you have to give a 15 day notice of cancellation and they will still charge you crazy fees no matter what the staff is so rude unprofessional and uncaring the manager no different than the other employees it is a ghetto gym I am still struggling to get my money back that they keep charging and overdrafting my bank please people save your money and go elsewhere LA Fitness is a little more expensive but we'll worth it staff is nice helps you in any way and a lot cleaner this gym is a fraud,negative
"Smh... sales girl was rude and was so focused on her ""script"" it was hard to even get a word in. Oh and at one point one of the front desk girls came up to her to ask for something not to sure what and she was so snappy with her in front of me then talks crap about her to me as she walks away. SN the childcare looks like a prison with bars everywhere... but it was nice to see the attendant interacting with the few kids in there and doing a craft. Safe to say I didn't sign up nor will I ever.",negative
Terrible terrible terrible terrible terrible terrible My wife and I just signed up and have been here less than one month. I came in today and 8 yes 8 running machines were inoperable. The one that I did get had a glitch that would make it skip and pause in the middle of a run which caused me to almost fall off. Rather than continue running and sue the shit out of them for having defective machines I informed them of the issue. I was met with a very rude and curt GM and worker who told me there was nothing wrong with the machine. I then showed them what was wrong with it. The worker then became very rude and continued to try to stare me down. I was able to have a relatively decent conversation with a trainer BUT the problem is at the top. Rather than thank me for helping them instead they were confrontational. Join at your own peril,negative
"i closed my account back in 2009 or 2010 and i just found out that for the past 7 or 8 years that fitness works has been charging me for a cancelled account that i closed with them because i was moving to another state that they did not have a gym in. i am in the process of purchasing a home and to find out i did not qualify because of the $2,000 collection that fitness works put on me that was opened in 2014. i was so shocked i had such high hopes and now iam learning that fitness works has been scamming people like this for years. i never received not 1 phone call or collection letter from this company or a final bill. i didnt even think about this until it haunted me tonight. fitness works is a fraud cant believe they are still in business. i dont even know wherre to start to get this issue resolved. everyone just keeps saying good luck with getting that worked out",negative
"this is by far the most disgusting gym I've ever been to in my life, its never clean, the trainers will screw you any which way that they can, they will take your money and give you faulty sessions meaning they will schedule you when even you have no idea. The gym always has the biggest dust bunnies ive ever seen in my life. The studio's where the classes are held are never mopped, The children center is absolutely filthy. i was a member for quite some time here at the Glendale location, i thought that maybe it would turn around, but thats kind of difficult when the GM jose himself never leaves his desk. and when you try to speak to him about any matters he looks at you like he's confused and then he says ""ill follow up with you"" or ""ill have ashley check on that and she'll get ahold of you"" and NO ONE EVER GETS BACK TO YOU, ive tested this theory personally and i also have some friends that were members as well that have had the same shit happen to them! this gym is a disgrace to the fitness industry, it only wants your money, they want you to hold your end while they dont hold theirs. the machines are always broken and the staff is absolutely horrible. i have absolutely no positives to say about this gym. im going to EOS. and you should too!",negative
"If I could give a 0 I would. This place is a complete rid off. the BBB, google reviews, and corporate have all been informed. I was charged a total of $578 for services I am not recieving that has been cancelled and getting a refund has been a nightmare. I realistically should be recieving $1734 since my personal trainer constantly forgot about appointments, showed up late and canceled on us for a month. The receptionist is beyond rude and the general manager, and managers are impossible to get in contact with and don't call you back when they promise to. I talked to corporate and was told that only three people work at the corporate office and the recptionist there told me the person incharge of refunds was out of town for a week.",negative
Truly nothing spectacular about this place. Old equipments that need to be switched out. Buuuuut it's $10/month & the equipment meet my training needs. I use to do orange theory & la fitness but that was over $100/month and they close early where I couldn't get to class on certain days of the week :(. Miss them but this gym is open 24 hrs so why not.,negative
Place is a dump. Old equipment and stair masters and treadmills are 20 years old and half don't work. Tvs on wall are so small and tv monitors on that cardio machines don't work. Spa has dirty and human body skin on top of foam and water and staff don't do any cleaning. Bathrooms are disgusting and never no toilet paper. Changing room smells and nothing but old men walking around naked. Staff is rude. When I went to cancel my membership they asked why and when I told them they didn't so oh I'm sorry we are working on it please stay or here is two months no charge nothing to get me to stay. Just looked at me strange and said ok sign here. Then walking out I heard them telling new members that we are newly owned and changing a lot. FYI. Steer clear. They also try to take dues out twice a month. Another task to call and take care of that.,negative
"The gym is OK. Here's my beef, and I've been almost a year trying to resolve it... There are multiple memberships on my account. I go in and cancel them, then before I know it, the company that does their billing is contacting me again. I am not under contract. I had to have my bank decline their multiple charges, because they won't fix it. I can't tell you how many hours I've spent, and how many times I've been told it's all resolved, and it never is. I will NEVER have anything to do with them again--if I can ever get free. If by some miracle it ever gets resolved, I'll update, but I'm not holding my breath. If you value your credit score, stay away.",negative
"Be very careful when signing up for personal training sessions. Signing that contract is like committing to a mortgage. God forbid something happens and you want to post pone your sessions...aka. payments. I have 9 more sessions that I already paid for but I can't use them until I buy more.... They won't hear you out and will kick you out of the gym. Otherwise I like the gym, it's too bad they're inflexible and that I am being forced out. Also, customer service is great when they're signing you up, but thereafter is egh...",negative
Wtf is with this payment/canceling scheme they're running? Surprised they haven't had a class action lawsuit. I'm sure they will in the near future.,negative
Wow .. I live right down the street and I had hit a 3 day pass. Went in and the guy would not let me workout because my zip code was not from the area. What bull shit !! I will never come back to this shitty non great full place. I might of signed up of it weren't for that ass hole !!!!,negative
I will never recommend this gym to anyone I know. The equipment is always broken the staff is so unfriendly. The sales team is horrible. I had an issue with not being told about a $40 annual fee and talked to the sales associate and he basically called me a liar over the phone and was extremely rude. Why i was being charged an annual fee only two weeks after being a member is completely mind boggling. Never go here!,negative
"Worse choice I've ever made. Trainers are great but horrible customer service especially for their ""manager"" Chris. I don't even think he is a manager or has ever been a manager in the past. Billing sucks, totally robed money from me and it never got resolved! They tell you to sign up but when you don't show up for classes they still charge you and don't respect your next sessions. Lost $1300 dollars and never got a refund nor a call from them. The GM doesn't even do anything about it. This place sucks. Save your money and go else where.",negative
"I was severely injured at this gym while under the supervision and guidance of one of their 'certified instructors'. My body went into shock as I collapsed into a cold sweat and struggled to maintain consciousness. The manager on duty at the time was named Mark. After being assisted into the men's locker room, they brought in the chiropractor who has a practice (a very busy practice) located inside of this gym. They weren't sure if an ambulance should be called, but it was clear I was coming and going in and out of shock. The chiropractor took some x-rays and noted a sublimated disc at l2-l3 of my spine. The next few days at my home were some of the most painful days I have ever experienced. I could not tie my shoes without practically breaking down into tears. After numerous attempts bending until the pain was too much, I'd take a breath, and try again, over and over and over again until I could endure the pain long enough and tie the shoe fast enough. Then I could repeat this process until I got my other shoe tied. Sleeping was quite difficult trying to find a comfortable position that wasn't sending lightning bolts of pain up my spine. I spent about $2500 on the chiropractor and followed all of his instructions to finally get some relief about 2 weeks later. Not complete relief, but relief enough that shoe tying was no longer a 20 minute battle every morning. Then I discovered Fitness Works was continuing to bill me $250 every two weeks for more personal training. During this time, no one at Fitness Works did a welfare check on me, including the manager 'Mark' who witnessed this injury when it occurred. They said I had to come back to the gym to fill out a membership freeze request. I hobbled in as best I could, still in considerable pain and not having full movement only to have the unpleasant experience of dealing with this 'Mark' person once again. His attitude was dismissive and though no one had explained or volunteered to fill out the medical freeze form for me prior to this point, under severe duress I signed the paperwork so the billing would stop and after more rude and unnecessary unpleasantness from Mark, I was glad this automated billing system would stop and that I would be getting a refund for what was taken. I've since learned a standard medical freeze is just 90 days, but Mark decided this first medical freeze should only be for 60 days. While I'm dumping $2500 into the chiropractor at the gym I suddenly notice another charge for personal training for $250 appear on my credit card without any notice or phone call from the staff asking me if I'm ready to come back. At this point I started dealing with Chris, another manager at the gym. Chris seemed genuinely concerned and wanted to do the right thing. He told me medical freezes are a standard 90 days and ask me why my first one was only for 60 days. I told him he'd have to ask Mark that. Now repeat this process 5 more times over the course of the next 15 months, with the final putting me up against this Mark character again. Mark likes to treat people as if they work for him. He likes to ask questions to appear in control. But when you ask Mark questions, he won't answer them. He realizes the one asking the questions is the one on offense, and answering questions puts him on defense. Remember this psychology any time you face the unfortunate task of dealing with Mark. Don't let his intimidation or size distract you or cause you to lose your focus. If necessary, leave and can come back later and talk with someone else. I'd also recommend you do what I did and use your phone to voice record the entire conversation (he doesn't have to know - Arizona is a one-party state.) These recordings can be use as legal submissions of evidence should you need to go to court or escalate your complaint to the president or vice-president of the company. Talking to Mark reminded me of being 14 years old again and dealing with the high school bully. He lacks the most basic of customer service skills and how he became and has stayed a manager at this Fitness Works location is a puzzle. The journalist inside of me suspects Nepotism, but didn't think it would be a very compelling story for my publisher either way, so I didn't pursue those answers. After more than a year of this nonsense, they tried once more to bill me for training that I am still not cleared by my doctor to do, but the charge did not go through (imagine why). I received a phone call from the billing company instructing me to go to my local Fitness Works with my current billing info. This was my last interaction with Mark. Mark ultimately gave me what I requested, but first he had be sure he did his best to harass me and push all of my buttons. When he wasn't getting the reaction he wanted, he gave up and gave me what I asked for. I was told by both Mark and Chris what I wanted couldn't be done and by the end of the day, they both got each un-doable task completed",negative
"I'm not usually one to go out of my way and write a review, but this place is so awful I had to save anyone else from considering it. I even went out of my way and made an account just so all of you could know. I had a membership there right before I moved to Flagstaff, and been a member for about a year. During my time I would go there at random times throughout the day. Evenings were the messiest, the most crowded and you could hardly tell they had the air conditioning on. Mornings and late nights were the times I would recommend due to cleanliness, organization, and availability of equipment; however, this is only if you do decide to sign up with this gym because you have NO CHOICE. Few of the staff were nice, the majority were no help and rude, the guys were perverted, and not to mention the manager, Chris, who would say anything just to get you out of his presence, even lie. Oh, and it's true about some of the equipment being broken and taking too long to get fixed and about being harassed into getting personal training. Oh and when you've called too many times to complain the staff pulls up your file and they always go over your ""notes"" and then they begin to give you attitude. It never failed. In the end when I wanted to discontinue, they wanted me to pay an extra couple hundred for a month of personal training that I would never get to use since they did not inform me that I had sessions left. So yes I called the corporation and complained and I was stuck talking to them and settling things for months after I cancelled. One lady, Rebecca, that worked at headquarters understood my situation and was nice enough to half the sum of money they were forcing me to pay. However a month later, I still got a call from collections saying I never made the payment to which I had to call headquarters again so they could call collections and have it cleared up. FITNESS WORKS IS A TERRIBLE GYM TO PUT YOUR TRUST INTO. I learned the hard way. There is so much more to my experiences with them but I think I've said enough. They are scheming little frauds and will do anything to try and take your money.",negative
"Worst customer service and equipment! The gym is always dirty, the equipment is always broken, the customer service is terrible and it must be a horrible place to work cause I see a ton of people complaining to the staff, about the staff and the conditions there and they have a high turn over rate for employees. Personal trainers come and harass you to sign up and do their person training sessions. The lockers always smell, pool always has a weird film on it and the tile is always slimey. Pool weights and items are always broken, mangled and not well kept. I can go on for days...",negative
"I am a young, single mother in debt because of this gym. I tried a free 3 month trial but had some financial issues before the 3 months was up. I have been given the run around about canceling from multiple people. I now owe a few hundred dollars and get calls from debt collectors all because of a FREE trial.",negative
"Its a nice facility however I notice that they allow kids to be running around messing with all the equipment while adults are trying to get a serious workout in. The classes are awesome. I noticed the muscle bound trainers like to stop and flirt with the women that are trying to work out. If they are ""offering assistance"" shouldn't they be offering it to everyone? Js",negative
"Wish i could leave a Negative star rating for this place. I had signed up before the place was ever opened as I live right by the place and would be able to walk there. I enjoyed it for the first few years, but then life and change of jobs kept me from going. I kept the membership for awhile after that in hopes of going back, but finally realized I was not going to. So I called to cancel the membership....this was in 2008. I was told I had to have a written letter of cancellation. OK, fine.....I brought in a letter to them and gave it to the manager. Since my billing period has half over and they require a 30day notice, I had to pay for another full month, OK, I get it, 30day notice. The problem is they kept billing me, I spoke with them and they claimed they would fix it and refund me. Never happened, so I cancelled the card that was on file with them. I knew about the 1 year contract, no problem, I had been a member there for years, so the contract had been completed and on a month to month basis. So I go and check my credit scores as I am going for a new house and here is this bad debt that just recently was filed with one of the credit bureaus (about 3 months ago), showing last payment made in 2008. after some research I figured out that this is some shady collection agency that does collections for various fitness clubs. I was never contacted by this company, my address, phone number and everything is still the same. Why fitness works turned my closed account (closed in writing), that had always been paid on time via automatic draft, over to a collections agency I do not know. So this may end up costing my money in a higher interest rate on a home loan. I am going to be filling a complaint with the better business bureau.",negative
"READ THIS PLEASE! My friend recommended me this gym when it opened. We went and tried it but had a terrible experience with the front desk staff. Very rude teenagers with no customer service skills and if you need help they wont aknowledge your presence until they finish texting or talking to their coworker about last nights party. I IGNORED all of that and focused on working out and using all the amenities and classes. I loved the sauna room although it is so tiny sometimes it was full and I had to leave disappointed. One month they charged me double without my consent and I was livid!! I use a checking account for all my bills and I deposit exactly what I will spend in bills for that month. Of course they overdrafted my account and by the time I noticed their mistake and called them I had extended overdrawn fees. I called them, asked to speak to the manager ( different teenagers pretended to be the manager) and they were extremely rude telling me it was NOT THEIR PROBLEM THAT I DIDNT HAD MONEY IN MY ACCOUNT FOR MY OVERDRAFT FEES AND THAT THEY WERE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THAT AND THAT THEY WOULD ONLY CREDIT WHAT THEY CHARGED ME BY MISTAKE. I was ok with that but the way the handled the situation was horrible!!! After all this happened I was not happy or comfortable, the kids at the front desk would give me nasty looks every time or laugh at me. As silly as it sounds it made my supposed to be RELAXING work out session very uncomfortable so I decided to cancel my membership. WELL thats when I discovered that I had a 1 YEAR contract!!!!! That nobody told me about!!!!! The sales kid (another muscular teenager) never mentioned that small detail! NOT ONLY THAT!! THEY HAD MY SIGNATURE!!! I SIGNED SOMETHING COMPLETELY DIFFERENT and they used my e-signature for the contract as well. THAT IS CALLED FRAUD! Long story short.. I got so mad and called so many times wrote letters and complained at the BBB that they went ahead and cancelled without me having to pay the outrageous amount they were asking for!. Stay away please!!! There are much better gyms out there, even the ghetto planet fitness is better ( if you live on the west side). LIFETIME fitness is WAAAY better their staff is super understanding and helpful, they have great amenities and classes and its CHEAPER!!",negative
"Stay AWAY from this gym!!! Before you even consider signing up with them, beware that they are running a billing system that I would consider fraudulent. The electronic forms you sign do not contain the price they promised, and then they will charge you whatever they want. The manager, Chris, is an a**hole that will back out from his words. I would recommend NOBODY to this gym.",negative
"I've been at Fitness works for about a year and a half now and I've never once had a complaint. When I first stopped in to check it out, I tried GPT (group personal training) with Aaron and pretty much died within the first 5 minutes of the class...not to mention I couldn't walk or lift my arms for a good 3 days after. After that class, I was pretty much sold. I took GPT as well as followed the meal plan provided and lost 12 pounds in the first month and could notice my stamina and strength dramatically increase. I've been in the gym morning, noon, and night and it's never been insanely packed like other reviewers have been complaining about. There's more than enough equipment available, and even if you have to wait for a minute or two for free weight equipment, other gym members are always more than willing to share. The classes are awesome, the staff are super friendly and always helpful, and the gym overall is clean. I haven't had a chance to use the pool, but the steam room is great. Not to mention the bathroom/locker room is pretty spacious. Shout out to Aaron for being such an awesome manager of this place. He's really the go-to guy when you're really trying to break down and accomplish your fitness goals. I've also taken personal training with Nico who really knows his stuff. Not only does he make you work your ass off during training sessions, but he takes the time to educate as well. I also recommend taking GPT classes with Jose as well, he'll really work your ass off! If I could change one thing about this place, it would be extended hours! I work long days and frequently work the weekends. So it was always hard for me to get a decent workout in before work or on the weekends. But other than that, I've really enjoyed being a member of this gym! I unfortunately had to cancel my membership recently due to moving to a different city. I went in and had no issues at all cancelling. I was told up front that I was signing a contract for a one year membership and that once that year was up, it would be a month-to-month basis. So to all the nay-sayers stating they didn't know that they were under contract...always read the fine print, or else you'll never get anywhere in life! :)",positive
This place has great hours to work out. I can work out early in the morning before work or do a late work out. Its seems like they take good care of there equipment and has a great staff. I've been to plenty of gyms that are so packed you have to wait to work out But not here. I'm thinking of signing up with a trainer to see if I can work on more definition. I'll keep you posted,positive
"I like going to this gym when its not as busy, around noon to 2pm. I have been using Dallas to help me with my physical training and he has been great. I really notice me getting more defined and its great getting healthy again. I am not sure why everyone here is not having a good experience here but I really enjoy the gym.",positive
There is a 1 year contract the staff fail to tell you from the beginning of your membership. Staff is unfriendly and rude. Gym is always overcrowded and you never get a full workout. Little kids running around you. Teens hanging out at the machines talking.... I don't like machines but I can't use free weights because they are always being used and/or scattered in the most random places. The tv on 80% of their cardios don't work even after reported it for weeks. Nothing gets fixed. My sister-in-law had a personal trainer and I guess he was somehow pocketing her monthly payments cuz when he quit she had to wait for another personal trainer to be assigned to her. After a week she was asked to fill out paperwork to start deducting money for the personal trainer. She asked the staff why they needed the info again if she was already paying and they were already deducting money for the personal trainer.... Turns out the guy was getting paid off the books on his own now had my sis-in-law's bank account info. She had to deal with a huge mess at her bank to close it and get a new one. What kind of people are they hiring? This place is a joke.,negative
"BUYER BEWARE! Let me start off by saying the ONLY thing worth while about this gym is the classes. If you're into classes and thats all you're looking for then this place might be okay for you. Now onto everything that is completely wrong with this place. The men's locker room is dirty and smells. Usually there is no soap in the soap dispensers, or paper towels. The smell within the bathroom is something of a rotting/rancid sweat smell which makes me want to vomit every time I step foot in there. The pool is dirty and I would never step foot in it. The pool water is so cloudy that you usually can't even see the bottom of it! The gym equipment is old and beat up. The workers there will claim it is new but walk through this gym and then go to another gym and look at the equipment and you will 100% see the difference. Just to show you a example of the care they take in their equipment, there is a shoulder press machine that has been missing the cushion you sit on now for a solid 2 weeks, no way can anyone use this machine. They have TV's on all cardio equipment however I would say a good 40-50% don't work. Also, all of the equipment is so close together that you feel like you're constantly in the way of the other patrons, this goes for ALL the equipment, cardio, free weights, and the weighted machines. Now I feel like I'm your typical person, I go to the gym 3-4 times a week after work usually around 7. Reason I mention this is b/c this place is so packed every single time I go that you cannot get a full work out in. Forget about even going near the free weights, there are usually about 4-5 guys at each bench just circled around it. Same sort of thing happens at all the other machines, just tons of people everywhere. Some of the patrons even bring their kids! Kids are literally running around the gym while you try to work out. They even allow pre-teens and very young looking teenagers to join the gym. They basically do nothing but walk around the gym and take up the machines while they talk. Now the worst part of this gym, the staff. They are rude and unhelpful. I have been a member of this gym for about 2 months, I finally decided that I'm unhappy with the gym and I wished to cancel. Something the staff doesn't mention when you sign up is that it is a full year contract! The only way they will let you out of the contract is if you can show proof that you're moving more than 25 miles away and even then you are forced to pay 100 dollars. I have spoken to the GM of the gym regarding my experience at the gym and basically told him all of the above as to why I am unhappy with the gym. All he told me was that there is nothing they can do and that the contract is legally binding blah blah blah even after I told him that if I knew there was a year contract I would have never signed up for this place. Another example of how out of touch the staff and manager are with this gym, while speaking with the manager I asked him if he was aware of his reputation on the internet to which he responded, ""no, I don't look at whats said on the internet"". What type of person who takes their profession seriously doesn't look at whats said on the internet about their place of business and how they can improve?!?! Do some simple searching and you will quickly realize I'm not the only one who is unhappy with this place. I everyone who reads this to check out this gym more than once before signing up, if you're anything like me I think you will be severely disappointed. To be honest there are 2 LA Fitness gyms each about 10 min. away North and South of this place, do yourself a favor and go check out either one. I am 100% certain that when you step into one of those gyms you will completely see the difference in the quality of the staff and the equipment. I'm desperate to get out of this place and it seems like my only option at this point is to ""freeze"" my account for 5 bucks a month until I can officially cancel next year. Once again, be careful before signing up at this place. You will be disappointed!",negative
"Super Terrible! They do have a lot of classes and the membership is on the less expensive side. I, however, was not told I signed a 1 year contract! Shame on me for not reading the paperwork but that is VERY SHADY not to tell someone about a 1 year contract! The gym is filthy, the people in it are ghetto and the weight area looks like what I assume a prison yard looks like teaming with inmates. Most of the TV's don't work and neither does much of the equipment. The place is always PACKED to the gills with people no matter what time of day you go so just forget about using free weights. When I tried to cancel my membership I was told I could only do so if I provided proof that I was moving 25 miles away, was permanently disabled, or called to military duty. If I could prove any of those 3 things I could pay $99 and get out of the contract. You know, the contract I was never told about until I tried to cancel. I have asked 3 different people very nicely to just let me pay the $99 and be done with it. They won't budge. This place lacks professionalism, customer service, integrity and apparently a maintenance team. Also, if you go to their FB page there are rumors floating around that the trainers secretly take videos of members working out, show the videos to other employees to make fun of the members. Keep it classy Fitness Works!",negative
"Dr. Lynch is a great Chiropractor. My hip went out in 2007. For 7 1/2 years, I visited numerous Chiropractors in various countries across the planet. None of them realized my hip was out, not even with x-rays. Dr. Lynch popped it back into place after seeing what all the other people missed. His rates are amazing. My insurance copay to visit another doctor (as if I would) is more expensive than paying as a private citizen with Dr. Lynch. Also, Kayla Kuhn has been a fantastic massage therapist. I never realized how tense my back muscles were until I started my therapy at Floating Lotus. I owe these great therapists a great deal for their excellent care and treatment. They also have great personal mannerisms that is equally friendly and professional.",positive
"Every instructor that I have practiced with has been very knowledgeable, supportive, and well versed in the practice of yoga. Did I say friendly, everyone is friendly as well, you walk in and feel welcome.",positive
I love this place ! I do yoga here 3-5 times a week. I'm on the monthly unlimited plan and it's very easy and convenient. I have also had the acupuncture and that was wondrous. I dedinelty recommend this place ! I've also had a massage and that was just as good =),positive
"I had never done yoga before but had been wanting to try. Floating Lotus offers a free community class Sunday mornings, so it was perfect to try it out! Instructor Dawn was very welcoming but not overbearing at all and it was easy to join in, even for a first timer. My boyfriend who has some yoga experience also enjoyed it. This particular class used the gong which was pretty cool and you could feel the vibrations. Overall, the class was refreshing and we both felt energized for the rest of the day! Will be back. The location is also nice, as it's in downtown Mesa and we enjoyed walking around Main St for a bit after the class.",positive
"Love this Yoga Studio & Natural Healing Center! Such a bright, clean, and cheery place. The people are so welcoming. Highly recommended!",positive
"I was witness to a minor argument at an unassociated business near Floating Lotus, and to see normally credible contributors use Yelp as a personal flame thrower was disconcerting. Yelp is here as an assessment tool for the quality of a business, not for personal vendetta. I love and use Yelp to know where to spend my money, and I used Yelp to find Floating Lotus for healing and health, and I stand by the positive results I have received from the owner and Floating Lotus. Personal skirmishes ""off-the-clock"" should not be the measure of a business. The owner is a consummate professional and has never shown any bias based upon sexual orientation, and I will continue to patronize this business.",positive
The teachers here were great. I loved the atmosphere and never had a compliant about the yoga. The owner on the other hand is a crook. Please never give this guy your credit card. I was on a monthly plan and had to cancel a few months ago. I went in a turned in the required letter stating I was canceling my membership. Since then money has been taken out of account three times. I finally had to call my bank and have Floating Lotus blocked from removing anymore money. I called and left multiple messages trying to get this fixed and never once had my calls returned. When I finally did get him on the phone he was very rude. Please save your money and take your business elsewhere.,negative
I've taken several classes at this yoga studio with different instructors. I am never disappointed! The variety in the classes keep me engaged and wanting more. The instructors are absolutely wonderful and push me out of my comfort zone while always maintaining a grounded and peaceful space to practice. The studio itself has beautiful energy and light. This is the studio you want if you are looking for not only a physical workout but also a place to add to your spiritual practice.,positive
"What a wonderful studio! Being new to Yoga, I felt incredibly comfortable there with Karen's comforting style. I plan on returning to try out more classes, the atmosphere was relaxing and the yoga room is spacious.",positive
"Such a great studio in downtown Mesa! I love Deborah's class on Mon and Wed at 5:15! If you're looking for an unpretentious studio offering yoga at all levels, you can find it at Floating Lotus!",positive
"I started with a generous Groupon offer about two months ago, looking for a chance to try yoga as other exercise options are severely limited due to health concerns. Love the variety of classes from really beginner to gentle nudges to challenge yourself; there are power yoga, sculpt and tone and Zumba classes for those who really want to rock out! Too many great instructors to mention; though there's been some turnover recently, but hey, life happens to all of us. Membership options were clearly explained and prices are the best in the area that I've found. One of my friends joined me for a class recently and was warmly welcomed by staff and instructor; thanked for coming and I was thanked for inviting her. Love the ambiance and love the philosophy: that this is your practice, do your best practice today and don't worry about comparing it to other people's or even to your own previous efforts. I like that, since mine is a bit hampered in spots by physical disability. I would highly recommend to anyone looking for a studio to make their home. Construction issues on Main right now due to light rail install will be a pain thru the summer, but I wouldn't let that stop you!",positive
"First time yoga student First time at this studio Received a nice warm welcome from Steve, My instructor Kai was amazing I never knew you could sweat this much doing yoga Really impressed, the studio and mats were clean And the atmosphere was relaxing I will definitely go again!",positive
"Awesome studio, instructors, owner and medium for yoga on all levels. Sean is a particularly capable, experienced, thoughtful and calm professional instructor. Ignore anything in previous reviews about the owner and Nicole spat. That was about the difference between an ashram (not) and studio (yes) and then ethical professionalism (yes) vs. unethical business sabatoge and stealing (not). I have been involved in yoga for 15 yrs from Seattle to Phoenix, from Indian and Bali trained instructors to original newbies such as myself, and this is in the top five of 20+ experiences. Plus downtown Mesa is up and coming and great to check out. Check out Floating Lotus. You have a good chance that it will work for you on at least one level : )",positive
"I began going to Floating Lotus on on of their groupon passes. I had a fantastic teacher, Nicole, who has since opened her own studio Radiant Love. The owner of Floating Lotus, Dr. Lynch, is outright rude. I cancelled my monthly membership after Nicole left, but continued to go in once a week for an organic farm box delivery program that I really enjoy. Some times Dr. Lynch has invited me to come back for classes, and I have declined. Today, Dr. Lynch called me a very demeaning sexist name when I came in to pick up my package. How he expects to run a yoga studio while being demeaning and rude to those who walk through the doors is nonsense. Practice yoga. Practice Love.",negative
I tried this place out because of a groupon deal and loved the varied classes and the warm instructors. Non-judgmental and friendly atmosphere.,positive
I started yoga in April with a groupon to the Floating Lotus thinking I would use the groupon and that would be it. I fell in love with the studio// the instructors & the friendly attitude of everyone there. I feel at home when I walk in and after each practice I am refreshed and ready for the rest of my day. The instructors make each class unique// guide you through the poses and make you feel comfortable. I would recommend this to anyone.,positive
"Just got a $10 groupon for 10 classes, what an amazing deal is that!?! Great location in downtown Mesa and the room is spacious with perfect lighting. With so many classes available I can always turn to this place to get my yoga fill.",positive
"After 2 major abdominal surgeries in the past year, I was advised to stop weight training and attend a yoga class. Lucky for me a fellow classmate, Erica is the director of yoga and teaches at Floating Lotus. After one of Erica's classes I knew I was hooked, 25 classes later not only do I feel fantastic, I am beginning to see the benefits of a yoga practice :-) Not only is the studio spacious and inviting it's the best value I've found. I didn't need a groupon to convince me I had found a home. Leaving LA Fitness was the best decision I've made. I appreciate the serenity and positive energy I feel when entering the studio to begin my practice. I appreciate the high quality and passion of instruction each teacher brings to class. I feel like every teacher is a personal trainer dedicated to helping their students enhance the quality of their practice with each class. There have been recent changes with teachers and scheduling which have only improved the exceptional experience I have enjoyed. My daughter and I attend classes 3 to 4 times a week and enjoy the friendships we've made, while I continue to refer family and friends. If you are new to yoga or just looking for a new yoga home, you don't have to look any further. I highly recommend dropping in, meeting the amazing staff and experiencing the Floating Lotus difference.",positive
"After getting a groupon deal, I've attended several different classes at this studio - all led by Nicole. The studio itself is nice, with lots of ambient and natural light. But Nicole really made the class and her classes were ALWAYS full! I was contemplating getting a monthly auto-pay pass, but now that Nicole has left the studio, I find myself wanting to find out where she is and see if I can follow her there. She was that good!",negative
"Is it possible to give negative stars?!? A friend introduced me to Floating Lotus and I LOVED it! Nicole is the BEST, most amazing instructor!!! I signed up for the auto-pay plan and needed to stop it for a few months to help a family member with some health issues/bills so I called Steve (owner) and requested to cancel the auto-pay. I could not believe the way Steve treated me... he began to YELL at me (I am not exaggerating either, he YELLED at me!!) and challenge the reason that I was leaving. An instructor had left the studio the same day I called so Steve assumed I lying and was really leaving to follow the instructor when that was not the case at all. When Nicole found out the way I was treated she contacted me and smoothed things over. It was ONLY because of Nicole that I refrained from posting a negative Yelp review; I did not want the negative actions of Steve to affect her. I am writing this review now because I have learned that Nicole has left the studio due to Steve's never ending negativity. I work way too hard for my money to support a business that in this manner. I will never again support this establishment! Be aware! His groupon deals are great and will get you in the door but please consider the type of person that you would be supporting if you support his studio!!",negative
"I bought a groupon for this class and it is fantastic! I absolutely love the variety in the classes. Nicole is an excellent teacher, she is very friendly. This yoga is so much better than the Bikram Yoga and its kind that I tried before. It not only helps you tone, but more importantly relieves you of stress and you go back, being full of love, life and energy. Highly recommend this place. :)",positive
I bought a groupon for this studio and went to classes several times a week for a month. All the staff were friendly and addressed me by name after just a couple sessions. Most of the classes I attended were beginning/intermediate and they were always willing to work with anyone regardless of their level. I'm not sure if there would be enough classes each week for someone at the advanced level to attend but it is a fantastic studio for those at the beginner/intermediate level.,positive
"Took Empowerment class with Nicole, was great. She allowed you to safely challenge yourself in an atmosphere of care. Massage from Michelle, which was AMAZING! One of the most beautiful, caring massages I have ever received. I highly recommend treating yourself to a healing experience w Michelle",positive
"I have taken about 5 classes now at Floating Lotus. The yoga basics class taught by Nicole is the best yoga class I have ever taken (I have practiced for 2 years and all types, Basic, Bikram, Yin, Flow ect..) The studio is clean and really spacious, though the Yoga basics class fills the room. I have to bet it is because of the instructor Nicole. She makes me both laugh and cry (in a good way) with her teaching and inspiration. It is the best 90 mins of my day most weeks. I can't recommend this place highly enough for that reason alone. Like other reviewers stated, the owner Steve is also friendly and caring. I forgot my punch card recently and he had no problem trusting I would mark it off on my next visit. This type of business practice along with Nicole will keep me coming 2-3 times a week.",positive
"Great newer yoga studio in Mesa. Like a few other people I discovered Floating Lotus via Groupon, but even after my deal is up I'm sure I'll come back. The studio itself is beautiful. Steve is always super friendly whenever you check in and the instructors are wonderful. Floating Lotus is very welcoming and not at all pretentious like some other studios in the Valley. I look forward to them growing and expanding their class schedule!",positive
"Thank you Floating Lotus for an amazing yoga class while I was visiting from San Francisco! I was pleasantly surprised that the space was so peaceful - just what I was looking for - a little sanctuary for this busy mom. Coming from San Francisco, you can be a tough critic on yoga places (although we strive for no judgment in yoga, right :0) So, yes, I loved the space and my flow class. Thank you and see you next time I'm in town.",positive
"Beautiful yoga studio located in the heart of downtown Mesa, AZ. I go there mainly for chiropractic adjustments. Dr. Lynch is amazing! Really worth checking this place out!",positive
I have never done yoga before but consider myself relatively fit (for 50!) Izzy was a great instructor and let us all move at our own pace. I was surprised at what I could accomplish with her guidance. Most importantly I felt amazing the rest of the day and can't wait for my next session. Great studio and great team!,positive
"I am really ENJOYING yoga at this studio! I'm a bit hesitant to shell out $$ for a gym or yoga membership without getting to try it out first. So I was THRILLED when Floating Lotus offered a Groupon for 15 classes. I've been to 7 or 8 classes so far. Nikki has been the instructor for probably half of the classes I've taken. Her verbal cues are TOP-NOTCH! Her voice calmly keeps the focus on the mental & physical element of the practice as she guides you thru each pose. I've also taken a class or two with Jackie, Shella & Katie. Each instructor has their individual style & works to accommodate all levels. They have mats, blankets, blocks & straps to use as needed.",positive
"I had been looking for a yoga studio and came upon this place when it offered a Groupon. I've been to four or five classes here so far and like what I see so far. The yoga studio itself is really nice (and the blue ceiling is nice to stare at when I need to distract myself from the pain of a bridge position or something). I've taken classes with Nickie, Alexandra, and Katie. All three were good about accommodating different experience levels, correcting positions unobtrusively, asking about prior injuries, and offering alternative stretches. This may be because the studio just opened and is trying to adjust its course selection to demand, but the classes tend toward beginning and intermediate levels (which is fine for my rigid self). I did see a mention of possible Level 3-4 classes on the website, however.",positive
"Just joined Free Range. One of the hardest training weeks I've had in a very long time. Great fun, great people, awesome trainers and equipment. I wish I committed earlier. Lots of fit people here too!",positive
I came here 2 days in a row as a drop-in from out of town (UK actually). Everyone was so friendly and welcoming from the moment I walked in. I am still fairly new to Crossfit and they took good care of me. The workout was good and the equipment was great. Next time I am in Phoenix I will definitely come here! Luke the owner was great too.,positive
Absolutely excellent service! This gym truly cares about their community and takes care of anyone who steps foot into their gym. Trainers were 100% attentive and were clearly highly educated in CrossFit workouts and methodology. Will definitely be returning.,positive
"Dropped in without calling. Very nice people. Was introduced the everyone right away. Crazy friendly and busy 5:30 class. Good instruction, great workout. Will drop in again when visiting Phx.",positive
"I was in town for work and wanted to get a workout in. I'm found them nearby and i have to say that, they were very welcoming. This was one of the best boxes i have been in. Good group of guys and the trainers were very helpful. Next time i'm in town i will for sure stop by again.",positive
"I was visiting my in-laws from out of town and found Free Range to be about 3 blocks away from their place. I looked at all of the yelp reviews and was actually looking to go somewhere else because Free Range was not reviewed many times, but they were the only place that on their website had the schedule posted and a class to attend at noon. But man! I was very glad to go there and drop in. The entire staff greeted me and was very nice. I arrived 30 minutes early and they told me to make myself comfortable and do whatever I liked to get warmed up before the class started. Lucas was the coach for the noon class and he was very skilled on the movements for that class and looking at their leaderboards, he was no joke himself. And to top it off, they had Rogue everything! Rigs, blocks, squat racks, bars, plates... all Rogue. Will def drop by here again for my next visit! Pro's: Great Staff that is knowledgable and friendly, latest and top notch equipment, clean and air conditioned facility, competitive athletes within the class. Con's: I'd have to say the only con I saw was that the class was slightly crowded, but that just means that they're doing it right! It was basically just full enough to where people weren't strapped for space, but we were snug ;)",positive
"I started my Crossfit journey at Free Range Crossfit in April of 2013. My first free Basics Course with the owner, Matt, was a rough challenge, but Matt did an excellent job explaining all the moves and proper form to me as I was completely foreign to weight lifting. In 4 months, I met a lot of fantastic people, learned so much from each coach and lost 20 lbs! As a newbie, they were always attentive to my form and I never felt in danger of hurting myself. Now that I'm back in Phoenix, I've tested out several Phoenix Crossfit boxes and still can't find one that compares to the charismatic community and passionate trainers at Free Range Crossfit. For anyone considering doing Crossfit in genergal, regardless of which box you choose: ''You don't have to be good to start, you have to start to be good.''",positive
"Free Range Crossfit is awesome. I've had some buddies that did crossfit and all of them recommended this place because of the owner/trainer Matt. I was getting bored at regular chain gyms and felt i wasn't getting any better. I finally got up the courage to check it out. Right off the bat i was hooked to it. I signed up my second time there. There was no pressure or anything. I have been going to Free Range for about 4 months and in that little time everything has changed for me. I feel stronger, healthier and better at anything now. Everyone here encourages you and helps you in every way to help you reach your goals. Thanks to Matt and all the people here i'm in the best shape I've and have gained many new friends. I recommend this place to everyone!",positive
"I had been doing training programs & bootcamps for a few years, lifting at the big box gyms, but could never really find that next level of fitness I had been searching for. A friend and I decided after doing the Tough Mudder one year that we should try this ""CrossFit thing"". It was only going to be for a month, but half way through we decided that we should give it another month to really see if we liked it. Very quickly we both found that not only were we addicted to the results we were seeing physically, but the positive, engaging, goal setting, competitive enviornment was something new and leaving it started to beome blashemous. There are a quite a number of gyms around the Phoenix metro area, but what I think makes a ""box"" unique is two fold, one is the owner and two are the people who rally around eachother and push eachother to perform better everyday. The owner, Matthew Lucas, brings a postitve, healthy, encouraging presence to the incredible community that he has created and is watching it grow right before his very eyes. Now, having been a memeber for 7 months, I have put my body through an incredible change physically, mentally & spiritually. I have pushed myself to limits I never thought were possible and continue to surprise myself everyday! Matt's passion for his craft of ""forging elite athletes"" and more importantly his deep love of nutrition (www.foodee.com) and food have helped to create an irresistible atmosphere that engulfs everyone that walks in the door. Free Range is more than a place to do CrossFit, its my place to push myself to new PR's, set new goals, encourage others and be a mentor to those that are just starting out. If you're wondering if it's all it's hyped up to be, the answer is ""DUH!"" I would reccomend Free Range to anyone that is looking for a way to improve their health, physique, nutrition and overall outlook on life.",positive
Free range Crossfit was great! I was in town for a week and really enjoyed WODing with everyone at FRC. The programming was well thought out and the coaching was top notch. Thanks Matt and everyone at FRC!,positive
"I came by for a drop-in visit, and Matt hooked it up. Super helpful encouragement and instruction, really nice facilities, a real positive vibe - this is a great crossfit box. If I lived in the area, I would join. Definitely.",positive
Definitely a place that will make you feel welcome as soon as you walk in. Matt takes the time to give each person individual attention and whether you're just starting out or been at it awhile he can help you improve.,positive
"Great Crossfit gym! Programs are geared to help you master Crossfit staple moves. Not just Metcon stuff. I didnt think I could do a Kip pullup but now its a skill I can say I can do without hesitation. Location is perfect and very quiet. The owner Matt is not only a great coach but a top notch competitor. His attention to detail and friendly nature makes the environment at the gym very conducive to achieving your goals. The gym has a community feel to it, members are very supportive at the same time competitive to help you attain PR's. I consider these people my friends and we help and cheer each other to help attain personal goals. I'm actually new to crossfit and have not been an athlete all my life but Free Range makes it easy for anyone to get into this Crossfit thing. You'll love the benefits and most of all overall health.",positive
"This gym has unsafe workout spaces without any signs or warnings not to workout there! I fell and could have seriously hurt myself with the slippery floors in the equipment area where the bosu balls, plyo boxes, step benches etc are located! When I asked about this I was told ""nobody ever works out there-people only go there to stretch"". The last thing anyone needs is a dangerous workout area! I should have known from the other reviews posted about this facility. Not up to YMCA standards! I travel around the country and have not visited a worse Y.",negative
"My kids and I love going to this facility. The child care workers have always been great with my kids (2&3). And it's so nice to know that they are in good hands while I get my workout in! All the classes I have tried are wonderful! Renee is an amazing instructor! I've tried a variety of classes from Yoga, Cardio Kickboxing to Barre classes and they've all rocked! My only criticism is the swimming lessons we signed up for was Mommy & Me and the instructor didn't smile, wasn't kid friendly, and wasn't even adult friendly. After 6 weeks my kids are still not comfortable in the water. I'll be teaching them myself. I suggest they review their mommy and me classes, shorten the time from 40 mins to 20 mins and actually have fun & productive classes. 40 mins for babies and toddlers is too long to hold their attention.",positive
"We were going to the Y for the swimming lesson. We took three sets of swimming lesson. The first issue is the merry go round of teachers. For each set of the lesson, we end up with two or three different teachers. The second issue the teacher would tell you end of every class your kid is doing wonderfully until the last lesson they tell you they are entirely unprepared to go to the next lesson and do not tell you why. I wanted to know if he is having an issue with something so we can work on it before the next lesson. I feel they are not honest about how your child is doing during lessons also the continually changes teacher does not help either. The third thing they are going to tell you that they need private lessons, charge you for them and never set up the lessons. Then when you want to get your money back, you going to have to go to the location and fill out the form to get your money back. They can take your money, but they make it very difficult to get it back Also, this Y seem completely disorganized. They all seem clueless about what is going on the location. Also, I find a lot of the employees are unhelpful and rude. The sad part of all this is, I pay a lot of money for these lessons, and I still do not know if he learned anything at all.",negative
"I joined this gym thinking it was going to be a great experience. They have a heated pool and a large lap pool; however, good luck being able to use either. The heated pool is used for swimming lessons and the lap pool is always shut down to one lane for the local swim teams. They used to leave one or two lanes open to accommodate the patrons who just come in to use the pool to swim. Now they've taken those lanes over to have swimming lessons for all of Lorain Counties children. So much for courtesy. I will not be joining any more YMCA facility ever again. Thanks for retuning my call and email. Charity (Executive Director).",negative
"One of the worst gyms I've ever been to. All employees are unhelpful, rude, and condescending. Machines break and don't get fixed for months. You're unable to check out TRX cables unless you pay for a class-even if you already know how to use it. The setup is just bizarre. There is a running track right thru the middle of the gym, so you will always be running into runners during your workouts. All cardio machines, tiny weight room. Does not have more advanced machines at all. Kids running everywhere. Trainers actually sit while they ""train"" their clients. Way over-priced for the value you receive. The pool is disgusting, the sauna fits 4 people max, and the hot tub goes down fairly regularly, and also has absolutely no ventilation. Hours during the winter are terrible. And guess what? During the summer, when you would expect them to be open longer, they actually close earlier! Great for kids, parents, and old people. Which I guess is what they are going for. So in that case, keep it up YMCA. You're doing great!",negative
"There's a lot going on at this facility. My review specifically and only pertains to the fitness area(s). For a YMCA, it's probably about as nice as I've seen- but it better be seeing that's it's pretty new. There is plenty of cardio equipment and weight machines that are of medium to high quality. The clientele is generally courteous. For me, their is one major problem- wonky layout. There has absolutely GOT to be a better way to organize this area. 1. The free weight room is crammed into a cave and often too overcrowded as a result. There is only one power/squat rack. People are side stepping and running into each other in there. 2. A third of the cardio equipment is set up in weird patterns facing each other. While I'm busting my ass, there's nothing I love more than to be giving the ""eye of the tiger"" to a stranger right across from me. 3. Another third of the cardio equipment has a wonderful view of... half a basketball court? Meanwhile, half of the weight machines are set up to provide wonderful views of people's backsides while they are on said cardio equipment. Thank god for yoga pants! 4. Meanwhile, the other half of the weight machines are also set up to provide perfect views of people's backsides on different cardio equipment. 5. The entire window area (by the pools) is underutilized. The punching station thing is hardly used. Something more needs to be done with the entire floor space here. Maybe move some of the dumbbells out of the cave and into this place?",negative
"The membership fees are higher than other gyms with more equipment and others have free classes.All classes here cost extra. This gym is more geared towards children with little ones all over, lots of noise and clogged halls with kids everywhere. The design is poor as their track runs right through the weight room and I have had many near collisions with runners. The hot tub is closed often and pool closed due to events as well. Getting in and out due to the location so far off the road and a busy exit ramp can take 15 minutes alone.Then the front desk is another bottleneck with people trying to get checked in pay for classes etc.",negative
Too crowded. Too many kids. Weight room is TINY in comparison to the rest of the facility. Many high school football types standing around trying to look cool and chatting. Won't let us old folks use the benches. Time to find a new gym.,negative
"I have worked out on and off at Glove Game for a couple years. The reason it is on and off is because I have moved back in forth from Arizona to New York. I have done boot camps, and individual training sessions. Marty is my guy, and I would never cheat on him with another trainer. I'm sure the others are qualified, but I'm high maintenance. I saw great physical results in terms of strength and endurance from the bootcamp, which was my goal. I also learned some cool boxing moves during my 1:1 training, however after sparring a couple times and getting my ass kicked by a 50 yo man I have decided to put my fighting days behind me. Turns out I prefer punching bags to getting hit in the face. I had a sheet where I recorded my weight, and certain stats on a weekly basis which I enjoyed doing. 1:1 training is as good as any high end gym personal trainer, and costs significantly less. I only communicate with Marty, so I have never scheduling conflicts. I love this place and I have brought a few friends in for work outs. They always walk out smiling and nauseous.",positive
"I love this place! I have been going for about 5 months and I am never bored....I drive 40 minutes to get there about 3 times a week and cant wait to get there. Ihave never like to work out but now I have found the right place for me ""Game Glove Boxing"". If you try it you will love it too. My girlfriends go with me and they like the atmosphere and how confortable you feel while working out. THIS IS NOT your normal workout! Love it, Love it, Love it~!",positive
"I have to agree with this comment. My husband and I went for a training together. It is to be 30 min.... the time that we read our contacts etc was put towards our 30 min..... if this is the case, let us know to come early.....our trainer seemed utterly board. He did not want to be there, kept checking our time. As soon as the clock hit our 30 min mark (we worked out for about 15-20 min max) he stopped us and went to his desk to get his money... not a welcome feeling. We felt they wanted our money and wanted us out. We have been to other gyms where the passion is there from the get go and the trainers take pride in what they do. Maybe it was an off day for him.. but we were not impressed and unfortunately will be looking else where.",negative
A/C hasn't worked in WEEKS. I decided to skip asking someone in charge about it because I really don't care to hear excuses. I just want it fixed so I don't almost pass out every time I box. ** Michael is still awesome though. Gives a great workout. **,negative
"SUPER DISAPPOINTED!! I was incredible upset to have received bad customer service at this place. I was so desperate to like it that after the first instance of a poor experience I gave them a SECOND and THIRD CHANCE, they failed miserably. With a week's advance I set up a consultation for my boyfriend and I to train. The owner gave me the name of my trainer and said he would contact us to confirm. I never heard from the trainer, so I called the morning of my appointment to see if I was still in the schedule and the owner assured me he'd get everything straightened out and have that same trainer contact me. When the guy finally called me he informed me that he didn't work on the day I had specified and muttered an apology before hanging up (strike one). I decided to try and contact the owner again to see if we could fix the poor experience and get me in the gym. I, no joke, called the location TEN TIMES during their business hours that same day and not one person picked up the phone (strike two). I figured it'd probably be good for me to cool off, so I waited another day before contacting Glove Game. A gentleman answered and I told him I wanted to speak to the owner in regards to rectifying the poor customer service that had been dished out. He replied that he'd let him know it was urgent and that I would get a call soon. I never heard from the damn place (strike three). What does it take to get some good service around here? I have read about all the raving reviews and was so sad that I didn't get to experience the company's ""good side"".",negative
"Hooray for my 200th Review! I wanted to make my 200th kind of special so I chose my newest Favorite place. Don't get me wrong though, I kind of hate this place too. My reasoning: you work. You work damn hard. And that's the whole point. Harrison does not go easy on me because I'm a girl and I sometimes whine. He kicks my ass and then I say thank you! Kind of sexy. Everytime I leave, my arms and legs are shaking, I'm sweating my face off and I'm thinking nasty thoughts about how I'm never coming back, but then I find myself texting him the next day to see when I come back and train. Each time I come to the gym, I learn something new and I get just a little bit better than the last time. And he's great at mixing up the routine, some days we focus on arms and other days on legs. Nothing is more satisfying than defying your pain and growing your resistance and willpower. It's hard and it hurts and if you keep doing it, you and you alone get better and better. It's a lifestyle and I'm never giving it up.",positive
"My boyfriend & I train here with Patrique. The couple who boxes together stays together. :) Our trainer is cool, flexible & motivating. He pushes us, but isn't a jerk. We do wish the gym was a little cleaner though.",positive
"I'd give them zero stars if possible... My girlfriend and I got the groupon and attempted to call them a few weeks prior to the expiration (I know we shouldn't have waited so late, but forgot). Nevertheless, we only received their voicemail every time and both took turns calling them. I explained that we were concerned about the expiration date nearing and would like a call back. We never received a return call and I even called the day the groupon expired one last time. Very unhappy with this waste of money and this company. I can understand that they may have been overwhelmed with the number of calls and business from the groupon, but that does not excuse them from not returning calls... I will tell anyone that I know and asks to avoid this company. At the very least it would be nice to have a refund of our money, but I'll just chalk it up as a lesson learned.",negative
What do I even say! Just finished my first session here and I can already tell that I am going to be a sore girl tomorrow! John was awesome and very patient with my very out of shape self. I'd highly recommend this to anyone- all of the trainers seem great. Looking forward to another ass whooping on my next session!,positive
"This place is so disorganized. When I called to make an appointment on the main line, I was told to contact the trainer directly, so I left a message on his cell. By the end of the next day I still hadn't received a call back, so I called the main line again where I was able to make an appointment. Why couldn't I do this the first time? And each session is only 30 minutes, but without fail 10 of them consisted of waiting for my trainer, Henry, to finish with the client prior to me, then waiting for him to find and roll the wrist wraps to put on me and my husband. Perhaps they need to hire someone part-time to clean up all the papers and roll the wraps every once in a while. The actual training was too intense for me to the point of hardly being able to breathe (I generally do low-key workouts). However, it wasn't enough for my husband who also has a personal trainer. He was hoping to do more boxing and less cardio, which was too mellow for him. In the end, it wasn't worth the hassle of attempting to drive over there from Phoenix only to work out for 20 minutes.",negative
I've been going to Glove Game Boxing for a couple months now. I love it! Rory never fails to challenge me and push me to the limits. Best money I've ever spent.,positive
"I was gifted a Groupon for 10 one-on-one boxing session, which said to call the gym, schedule and appointment and mention my Groupon. I had some trouble getting a response--I called and left a couple messages and I sent an email. I received two calls a couple days later. I got the impression that there isn't one person who books sessions (I later found out that the trainers work independently). I was a little nervous to start this type of training, but after Peter's warm welcome I began to feel more at ease. I let him know that I don't feel comfortable having anyone punching toward my face or body, and he promised that he'd be extra careful when the time came. After wrapping my hands up Peter had me warm up. The first time I did a simple block-running exercise, where I discovered I'm not as agile as I thought! The second session I did pushups VEEEERRRY slowly in three different hand positions. Incredibly effective in getting my heart rate up. The first session is all about technique. I learned the proper way to stand, cross and jab, and how to hold my body. It's a lot harder than it looks! I was instructed to ice anything that ached. My hands were a little sore the next day, so I took a couple Advil and iced away. The second session we actually got to go in the boxing ring! I had been practicing; Pete could tell, and he was excited about this. Glove Game is not your typical fancy-shmancy Scottsdale gym. It's a place where you can be yourself and where your trainer pushes you to the limit. There is this energy that happens when you're training; you are focusing so hard on your body's movements that the world disappears around you--only you and the trainer exist. I'm very much looking forward to my next 8 sessions, and the ones I intend to purchase in the future.",positive
"I like many of the others got a groupon to try this place. I WISH i would have got the 10 session groupon but i got the 5 session. I've been to 2 sessions thus far and am seeing results already! the 30 minutes goes by so fast and was only initimidating the first time as I was brand new to boxing. My trainer is great and I know he sees the pain in my eyes but keeps pushing without being a punk. The sessions are normally $20 each, and they recommend 2x a week. After my groupon is over, I plan on going once a week. A friend of mine is a personal trainer and charges $25 so $20 is pretty reasonable. I recommend running by the canal as a warm up and REMEMBER to stretch before and after!! I wish I would have stretched more after my last session... It would make normal bodily movements easier.",positive
"had a 5 session lesson through a groupon with my trainer Pete. i've been doing american/muay thai kickboxing for about 10 years, and realized my boxing game needed quite a bit of work after going through my lessons with pete. in 30 minutes, he had me sweating and tired, arms on fire, and realizing that as good as you think you are, you can always get better (and that there is ALWAYS someone out there better than you!). great workout, friendly group of guys.",positive
Bought the 5 session groupon here for my daughter. She had her sessions with Mike and Henry and they were both great! They worked her out good and she got along with both of them. It's been a great experience for her so far and she wants to continue going!,positive
"I have been much more active over the past nine months between half marathon training, multiple weekly zumba sessions, and the occasional yoga class - just after just two sessions with Pete at Glove Game Boxing, I have had my ass handed to me. I purchased a Groupon for 10 sessions. These are 1:1 sessions with a trainer, 30 minutes each. It is amazing how challenging 30 minutes seems when going through the drills. Jumping rope, medicine ball, 3 push-up positions, sit-ups, dips - and that's the warm up. Strap on the hand wraps, slip on the boxing gloves and it is time to hit the ring. Jab, cross, upper cut and hook - punching the trainer's hands, working the heavy bag, ducking punches. Whew. I am tired just typing it. After a session my arms are jello and a water bottle is difficult to lift. The gym is located on the top floor in the same building at FnB, Cowboy Ciou, and Lee's Cream Liqueur. Typically each session is $20 - you will definitely get a workout!",positive
"Just had my first appointment with Marty and it was one of the coolest things ever. This place is legit, it's centrally located, and they clearly know what they're doing. I've run in triathlons before and thought I was in decent shape, but he showed me otherwise inside of about 3 minutes. This is a lot of fun, and you get all the other things that come with it too like confidence, toning, etc.",positive
"Glove Game Boxing is awesome!! This is a great place to get a kick-butt workout and learn new skills at the same time. Rory is excellent to work with - he is patient and attentive, and makes the workout fun. I look forward to going, and feel so great when I am done. It is a perfect way to relieve stress. Everyone who works there is friendly, and the whole place has a great vibe!!!! I highly recommend trying Glove Game Boxing.",positive
"I just love it. It's a great place that makes you feel right at home. I hate going to gyms, actually I hate working out in front of anyone, but I feel so comfortable here that I don't worry about it. I know that they're just trying to get me to the fitness level that I want to achieve. Rory, my one on one trainer, is amazing. He seems to know just how much he can push me and how much I can really do even though at times I don't even believe it. The boxing lessons are fun and I love the fact that I'm working out and learning something new. The 30 minute workouts are just the right amount of time. The prices are fair and reasonable. The owner is just a delight and all the trainers are professional and great. Glove Game Boxing packs a lot of heat within it's wall. Go check it out when you get a chance. For only $20 you can get a trial session and that to me is a pretty sweet deal.",positive
"Small gym but this why its called an ""express"" gym! Very friendly staff! Bought a 12 month contract for $19.99 a month for my husband and I, added on $10 more for tanning a month! Much cheaper tanning than anywhere in Vegas, beds aren't THAT great but if you just want to keep your tan or get some color, it'll do! Never over crowded and always able to get on any machine! Love this place!",positive
"The Duchess of Golds? I guess it's time to finally write a review. If you're pressed for time or just don't feel like driving to Losee this gym is your best bet. Don't expect a mega gym or classes here. It's more of an ""express"" location. Truth be told, I'm a LVAC girl but my boyfriend likes me to join him at the gym so I happily oblige. But If you're in the mood for cardio & lifting heavy things this place gets the job done. With that being said, it does manage to have the cardio cinema and tanning room (which personally I don't need to use, I'm tan all year long lol). The lockers rooms are small but like I said this location is basically the bare minimum as far as gyms go. Not complaining though, I've never had to fight for a machine here (I'm a lover not a fighter) and the staff has always been friendly. Bottom line, if you're in a rush and don't have high expectations...you've met your match.",negative
"After coming to this gym for almost a year, I'm actually a little surprised by the low star reviews. When I first arrived to sign up for my membership I was a little shocked by how small it seemed but it didn't take long to see how much this place had to offer. At my first appointment, I was offered a physical assessment. Insert heavy breathing and a lot of sweating. The trainer was amazing. He offered suggestions with a meal plan and a physical routine and then he put me to work for the next hour. Since I'm in overall decent shape, I didn't see the need for the full time personal trainer but these guys know there stuff. This location has so much to offer. There is the cardio cinema upstairs. Inside there are stationary bikes, treadmills and ellipticals. The movies are a range in classics to movies that have just been out a few years. Despite the sign in the gym, the website isn't typically updated with the month to month listing of movies. But guys make sure to clean your equipment in the cardio cinema when you're done. Just because it's dark doesn't mean we can't see you not clean it. They also offer the kids club for a small fee. The ladies that run the place are great! My little gingers love them! Just make sure you fill out the paperwork and have your kids shot records. And now the kids club requires a 24 hour notice for all appointments, so plan ahead! The tanning is also nice. I've added it in with my monthly package to get the best deal. They have 2 stand up beds and they always seems available. Just let the front desk know and they will set your bed up and you are good to get your tan on. Though this location is a smaller one, it is packed with tons of equipment. The upstairs is full of cardio equipment, most having iPod hookups and tv's. So bring your headphones. The downstairs is full of weights and other random machines that I have no need for but are always occupied. Like any other gym this place gets full after normal work hours and then people complain. It is a smaller gym but if you want to get right on certain equipment don't come Monday through Friday between 5 and 7. It's not worth it. There are other Gold's locations near by but this one is conveniently located in the Aliante area.",positive
"Always too packed, the trainers here act like they and their clients have enough room to do crossfit workouts in this tiny gym. Only 1 bench press, 1 squat rack for a GOLDS?!?! I can only workout out on weird hours because it is just way to small and busy all the time especially from 3-9pm. The kids day care thing is a joke and they should not have even included it because it just takes up space. I think it should be removed to allow for more gym equipment. There are never any paper towels in the mens locker room which is also tiny and it does not have enough lockers. And the worst part is the water fountains are never cold, always luke warm at best. Its a sloppy designed gym but it is conveniently close to my house so it gets one star. Golds is just another big name gym trying to rip you off now... After you sign up they don't care about you at all.",negative
"I just finished up my VIP 1 week free pass, so I went in to sign up this morning. When I got the pass, I explained that I only needed one month to work out. I just finished grad school at UNLV in May and no longer have access to their gym and am moving out of state in July, so I just needed a gym for the month of June. I was told this would not be a problem and that I would be able to sign up with no contract probably for around $15 a month. Well, this morning I was told I had to pay an enrollment fee, $24 a month, and then a cancellation fee for cancelling within the first 6 months of my contract. A month would cost me $100. I told the man helping me that I was not told this when I first came in, and he said he would talk to Shane who gave me my free pass and see if he would just extend it or try to work out something else for me for a month. He let me work out and when I left, Shane said ""Well there's nothing I can do for you so good luck."" This is the guy who told me it would be $15 a month. Good luck on your customer service skills, Shane, because they pretty much suck. UPDATE: They called me yesterday (3 weeks after the above happened) and offered me another free week pass. I refused...I don't really see the point as my wedding is this week and after that I am leaving Vegas. Too little too late.",negative
The gym is very clean. The staff is so nice and welcoming. Sariah was so helpful when I set up my personal training sessions! I love this location.,positive
"Be careful of this gym.The staff is not well trained in customer service and does not seem to know that eye rolling when taking to customers is not acceptable. Also, the gym is not very clean, and there are rarely any cleaners available to wipe down machines. The day care is okay if you don't mind teenagers who care more about gossiping than watching the children.",negative
"Although this is new Golds Gym with newer equipment it is relatively small club. There is a kids center, upstairs cardio equipment of about 6 treadmills, 3 StairMasters, 3-4 Ellipticals and a few bikes with a couple Ab roller machines. Then in the Media cardio room where movies are shown, yes movies, in a big screen projection, there are several more treadmills, bikes, and ellipticals. Its interesting bc it a dark theater room and your trying to do cardio, doesn't work for me personally but cool thought. On the main floor are machines and free weights. The free weight area is small with only 1 leg press, 1 Smithmachine, 2 bench's and a few free bench's/inclines. Dumbbells are a full rack from 5-100lbs. Full Cable machine rack, roman chair, calf machine and several machines for all body parts. They do have jump boxes and a few other functional exercise equipment. I like it bc its close to my house but overall i select which workouts I perform here due to limited space and weight/machine selection. I would give it 4 stars but the size of this gym is just too small to warrant it.",negative
"I typically always go really early in the morning so I never have an issue with it being over crowded. A few machines have been broken recently, but were fixed within a week. I have two small children (3 and 2) who are regulars at their daycare, and my kids love it. I am not in a contract, and so far have had no issues with payments or extra fees. Gym is always super clean. In fact, every time I'm there somebody is always cleaning.",positive
"Ahh! Gold's Gym. This is the most ridiculous gym I've EVER been to I wouldn't recommend it to my worst enemy! It's a nice sized gym & I love the set up but the staff & contracts are insane. I signed up for this gym in July & I loved it & it was month to month so I wasn't in a contract. Then Carey (Mr. Persistent) wouldn't leave me alone about a trainer! So he talked his way into lowering my first months bill to $28 & I would meet with Theresa once a week, every week. He also said he would give me an additional 4 training sessions for free, I wouldn't have to pay until my sessions were used up. Fast forward to the end of August & that's where I start having problems! I went in to change the card that I had on file for my contract & I asked Carey how many sessions I had available. He told me I had 4 left but my payment was due in about 4 days of $128 (not sure if he knows what ""free"" means exactly). I simply said okay & went home to call the company that the contract is under. I informed them that I would be moving soon for school & wanted to know how to cancel my contract with my trainer when the time came. I'm thinking I would have to pay a hefty fee & that would be it! WRONG! This guy told me I owe the gym not 128 but $160 & to cancel my contract I would have to provide proof that I'm actually moving (residency application & proof that my school tuition is paid). On top of proof I have to pay the $160 plus $250 to cancel plus an additional $128 for the last month which I can't use. But I loved loved loved my trainer Theresa though! She's so passionate about what she does & she motivates you, the sweetest person I've ever met! But there was times where she would either forget we had a workout session & DIDN'T show up or she would think my workout sessions were at times I never scheduled for! Oh & I can't transfer my membership to Washington state because this golds gym isn't universal.",negative
"This used to be clean nice place but now it dirty, overcrowd and management will do a quick switch and bait on their membership deals. Watch out for those hidden ""special assessments"" thats how they get you in the door and promise you its only 10 bucks a month then hit you with all these fees and changes. I felt better taken care at s used car salesmen convention.",negative
Terrible scam artists. Totally misrepresented my contract. There is othes gyms in the area...do yourself a favor and go elsewhere.,negative
"There's some ups and downs about this gym, but the main source of me joining, is to work out and make myself healthy, regardless where I work out. I joined back in December when we moved a bit further up north. I was a bit skeptical in a sense but I was at that point of accepting anything. Gold Gym on Aliante seems to be a decent size gym. Not to big and not to small like other gyms who probably have less equipment. Comparing it to other Gold Gyms, yea it is small but it does give you what you need to work out. I'll admit, signing up seems like a hassle, but you do have that option to say no. But I decided to get the personal trainer and see how it goes. The good thing I like about it, is that it's 24 hours and can work out anytime during the day. Especially for some one like me, who works graveyard. A few of them even greets me by my first name, before I get scanned in. Then again, I go there 6 days a week. They tend to be friendly and some of them tend to be quiet. I do like the fact that some of the trainers there tend to give me tips on working out and see what can be more effective. I never did go into the Cinema Gym, to work out, just to take a look inside and it seems a bit small with loud sound system. But I heard it was decent. As for my personal trainer, I did come to them to help me with my weight problem, so I can't really complain on what they think is best. Even though, I do agree, that they have this main objective to make you throw up. But I take that as me being unhealthy and my fault that I got myself where I am in the first place. On the other hand, I miss that athleticism that I use to have and the way they train me makes me feel alive again. I don't mind the work out they put me through, it's just a matter of me taking it and how much I can endure. Yes, it's a lot of work, but it's just 30 minutes once a week. I do agree that they tend to hire a lot of personal trainer, but so far, I enjoy my trainer and the people that work there. The down side of it, is that it's small in a sense, that it tends to get crowded quickly. Then you have people waiting for you to get off a machine so they can do their work out. Kind of feels awkward in a sense, but it's something to consider when you're at the gym during peak hours. To a pont that your work out has to be cut short cause the part of your body you want to work out is being used by some one else or being waited on by some one else. Overall, I would give this more of a 3.5 star rating. Despite Gold's Gym being a big name and high expectation, I consider this a decent place to work out. If you look pass the size of the gym, and find a decent time to work out, it can be very effective. I can understand that personal trainers there can be quiet and on their own. But it's just a matter of coming up to them and talk to them. Cause they don't know if you need help or want to be bothered, not unless you step up first. Signing up may be a bit of a hassle, but if you really want it, then go for it. Let them do their thing on trying to twist your arm, but overall, it's there job and doing what they need to do to keep their job. I'm sure if you ever got a job like that, you probably be doing the same thing, or be like those other trainers and be released. Other than that, I find this to be a decent place to work out. It's up to you how you see it, but it's great depending on when you go during the day. Usually, mornings and late evenings tend to be a good time. Afternoon and early evening tends to be more of the peak period, but I guess it depends on your schedule. If you join, where you can go to multiple Gold Gyms, take advantage of that too.",negative
"This gym is the devil!!! Told me I was signing a 12 month contract and could cancel at anytime if I paid the cancellation fee. They did a bait and switch and had me sign a 24 month contract (never gave me a copy... Had me sign electronically). Also, contract won't allow me to cancel even with paying a fee. The personal trainers keep quitting, transferring or getting fired. Went thru 10 trainers in less than a year. Spoke to the GM, Marcel... Said it was just industry standards and there wasn't anything he could do about it. This place is ridiculous!!!! Want to cancel but I'm stuck. Run... Don't sign a contract.",negative
"Love cardio theater & that it's not too crowded. I wish they wouldn't forget to restart the movie all the time. Annoying! Also, the front desk girl that chews gum with her mouth open-horrendous! Disgusting. Didn't your mama teach you any manners? I almost threw up my Luna bar.",negative
"Smaller Gold's gym then some of the other ones, that's why they call it an express gym though. Staff is always friendly when I come in and it's nice a few know you by name anytime they see you. Personal trainers are great and will push you harder then you've been pushed before. Great thing about going to this express Gold's is there is nearly never a wait for tanning and if you are there mid day then virtual no wait for any lifting machine and no wait for cardio machines. There are a few more things I wish they had on the workout floor but you can't have it all can you?",positive
"Small gym. It's an ""express"" location. The will lie and tell you anything to get you to join especially if you want personal training. Double check your contract because they will enroll your spouse without telling you. There is new staff everyweek because they are hired and fired weekly so if the person who signs u up gets fired they will not help you.",negative
This place is horrible there customer service is awful ! They are very nice when you sign up after that they are the worse customer service ever! Hahahha your closed now i wonder why****,negative
"The monthly price is wonderful, that being said they spend the rest of your membership trying to squeeze every dollar they can out of you. I tried to change my payment date and was told that the only way to do so was to cancel my membership, pay the cancellation fee and come back on the day of the month that I want my payment to be, re sign up and pay another ""annual fee"" of $39 even though I just paid that when I signed up three months before. Oh, and don't forget your towel. If you don't have one you have to buy one of theirs for a dollar, just another way that they grab at our wallets. I'm not even going to get into the pain that cancelling the membership is and the extra costs that they tack on. The cheap monthly cost isn't even worth it because the gym is always packed, even at 5am. I'm so happy that I'm finished with Gold's.",negative
"My wife and I have been members of this gym for over four months after moving from California and being gym members there. We love the Cardio Cinema and use it every day with only one recommendation, more elyticals. My wife and I like the front desk staff and especially a young redhead named Tanya. She would be great as Gold's Gym public relations trainer or possibly gym manager. We have automatic payment of gym dues and have experienced no problems. Quite a few gym members need to learn what the disinfectants and towels are used for.",positive
"A well balanced gym. Not leaning towards lifters or cardio. The clientele is cool. Most everyone is serious about their workouts. Not a lot of talking. The machines are always broken (cardio and weight training) however some seem to be getting replaced. There is a nasty water spill in the men's bathroom that has been there for a while. It's starting to smell really bad. Over all, setup is nice. I frequent a 24 hr fitness on Craig that I like a lot more. I use this golds for a change of scenery from time to time. Why only 2stars?.... well... nothing pisses me off more than their shitty ""no Towel, no entry"" policy. Golds gym west Covina has free towel service for all its members and charges the same membership fees. I've never heard of this kind of policy. There are broken machines, water fountains that smell like mold, missing clips on benches, and a water spill that I need to hop over in order to get to the sauna every day... but you're more concerned with posting large agressive signs and turning your customers away because they didn't bring a towel. Yeah yeah... people should bring a towel to the gym, I get it. But sheesh.... turning people away? I've been to a lot of Golds Gyms. I respect the brand. I love the atmosphere and I know how awesome they can be. This one has fallen a little further from the tree.",negative
Place deserves no stars! It's dirty! No one wipes down there machines the lack of care for place shows on worn beat up equipment! I joined for the theater sole reason! They never change the movies! Start them when it ends! Follow the schedule of movie that should be now playing! They are e treacly rude the just walk in and turn on lights for whatever reason! They shut it down at 945 not 10pm! They charge the SAME price as LVAC with zero services!,negative
"If I could give them 0 stars I would! Screw this gym, they only want your money. No wonder they have over 584 complaints on Consumer Affairs! Extremely upset and appalled at their unprofessional customer service. They don't send out notices or let their clients know when their contract/year mark is coming up. I wasn't even aware until I checked my bank statement and received a charge for $59.95. I called the gym to find out what was going on. They said my year contract was up and I was being charged $39 for the annual fee. Since when was my contract up? I then asked why no notice was sent notifying me that my contract was coming to an end. The girl on the phone paused for a moment, then said ""in the contract you signed, I'm sure you read the part about the annual fee"". .... How does that answer my question? Why don't you send out notices to your clients keeping them informed of this?! I asked to get the charge reversed and my membership canceled. They said they couldn't do that and gave me the Member Services phone number. I called them, and they gave me the same BS scripted response. ""The contract you signed stated an annual fee"". Sigh. I'm so irritated at the lack of comprehension these employees have. No one seems to comprehend that I am asking why no letter or notice was sent to the client. I understand the annual fee. Had I known it was coming up, I would've canceled once my contract was up. Needless to say, I'm out, just canceled! Packed gym, not enough equipment, plus this experience makes being a member here not worth it. Once the new LVAC opens, I'm headed back there. Gold's Gym is a joke. They may have the $59.95, but they've lost a client and I'll make sure to direct anyone who asks to any gym but this one. TIP: Write the date of your annual fee on a calendar, or put it into your phone so YOU are aware of the renewal date since they don't notify you.",negative
"So I just recently signed up to this gym about a week ago. The staff was very helpful. I'm not very good when it comes to working out because half of the time I have no clue what I was doing. Gus informed me about the offers they have with gym trainers and they take care of you! Stefon hooked me up with an awesome deal and now I'm excited as ever. If you guys are looking for a sincere staff that cares about fitness and your well being, awesome gym atmosphere, great classes and great equipments this place is it. They have tons of stuff, 2 stories and I only pay 20 bucks. I totally recommend this place!",positive
"Just moved from Chicago Suburbs, I was looking for a complete fitness center which offers a variety of classes and personal training. Living in N. Vegas, it was hard to find something close enough, much less with those requirements, plus reasonable monthly rates. Well, believe it or not, a different brand club manager referred me to check out Gold's on Losee. Immediately upon meeting membership staff, Blake S. and provided with the most pumped up tour I have ever had in my 40-something years in clubs, I was sold this would be my new home! Not only does Gold's work with your total fitness regime, however, they provide nutrition guidance. Blake's through tour and patience in answering all my questions, were the highlight of my day! (My last membership was with LA Fitness, so I know the questions to ask). Anyway, I can't wait to take my first class tomorrow, so I just may have to go tonite!",positive
"Their location is kind of dirty, and there's never any room to do anything because they're overpopulated all the time. The girls at the front desk are usually pretty rude, and if they're not rude they're standing around not doing anything. The staff members over badger you to sign up for different promotions. I get texts almost weekly from them even when I've told them I wasn't interested. They lied to me about my payment plan, and now I'm under fees that I didn't originally agree to. When I confronted the guy I signed up with about it of course he had no clue what I was talking about. The member services people can't do anything to fix it. I am almost hesitant to even try to fix the issue because I know for a fact that they're going to lie their way out of it. I'm not the only person who's had problems with them about hidden fees or false information. I probably came into the gym twice and I'm turned off about how it's not ever kept up, and the customer service sucks. When I texted the kid I signed up with to get the cancelation number he said it was on the back of my membership card, which I never received. So then he tried to talk me out of canceling then almost seemed judgmental about me canceling in the first place. It took forever to get to the point and for him to hand over the phone number. I am not impressed what so ever with this gym. I would not come back to this gym again nor would I suggest them to any of my family or friends. Honestly if you want to be tricked into high rates I would suggest going to Golds Gym on Losee. They're good for it.",negative
"Gold's Gym is garbage now. They lowered their prices to $10 a month and now they are always packed. The equipment is never clean and the staff are tools. Now they are trying to nickel and dime people by making towels mandatory and charging for their towels. How about you clean your own machines?! I didn't sign up to be your janitor. At the very least, keep your bleach bottles full! LVAC is a way better gym. I can't wait for the new one to open on 215 and N. Decatur.",negative
I walked in with a goal and Golds gym is going to help me every step of the way. The whole facility was clean and organize. The staff was very friendly and nice. A special thanks to Stephon for helping me with the gym tour and answering all my questions. The kids area was clean and very neat. I'm ready for this big journey with Gold's Gym. Thank you!!!,positive
Horrible misrepresentation of fees. I asked on the phone what ALL the fees would be and was only told $10 to join and $25 for the month. I would NEVER pay more than $25 a month. I go down to the gym and then get told there is an ANNUAL fee of $40. They are hiding the enrollment fee as an annual fee.,negative
"This isn't going to be a long review...just wanted to say the service at this golds gym is awesome! I went with a friend as a guest and signed up on my next visit! Also, the pool is open 24/7, so I can get my cardio in without running :)",positive
"Never been to a golds gym before, always been 24 hour fitness. But since this one is right around the corner and there are no 24 hours in my area, I decided to check it out. Once I walked in I realized there was no difference from what I'm used too. Really big gym, has basketball courts, pool, the works! I sat down with a manager to discuss rates and for $10 down I'm in for $20 a month! And I can bring a friend every single day for free. This is huge for me and my girlfriend. Looking forward to coming to this gym a lot! -Joe",positive
Even in late night the place is full. There is too many people endless place to work out. they have To make this place bigger.,negative
"Clean, fresh gym. I will drive the extra two miles to this gym versus the one I signed up at because it's just so refreshing. It has a great variety of classes to choose from, wow so many that sometimes I debate which I want to take. The staff is very friendly and the weight and cable machines are well taken care of, they seem new. When it comes to yoga Kieta is my favorite instructor, she just flows.",positive
"THEY CHARGED ME OVER $150 FOR 3 MONTHS OF MEMBERSHIP, APPLICATION FEES, AND CENCELLATION FEES WHEN i NEVER RECIVED A FRICKEN MEMBERSHIP CARD. So basically i was never a member and NEVER used the gym! This review is also going to the BBB, Facebook, twitter, instagram, Gold's Gym corporate CEO and referencing the Fair Credit Billing Act per the Federal Trade Commision for undelived service or goods. If you want to be cheated and scammed out of your money for trying to be a member, apply for membership.",negative
"This gym is terrible. I have a membership here and at LVAC and I am just waiting until the new LVAC opens on Decatur and the 2-15 to cancel my membership at Gold's because this place is a joke. There are only 5 Stair Master machines and at least one is always broken. The others are hardly functional and can't seem to keep a steady pace. Honestly, I think that might be a safety hazard in itself. I've mentioned it to the desk and they're still not working properly. On top of that, it seems like a new machine is out of commission downstairs every day as well. I can never seem to get in a complete workout because something I want to use ALWAYS happens to be broken. Also, the selection of machines as well as the quality of the machines here is deplorable. This membership costs me more monthly than LVAC ever has and I am 100% unsatisfied. Counting the minutes until the new LVAC opens.",negative
"I must say I was impressed with this location. Not only was the gym really nice, the customer service given was very welcoming. I signed up with Korbin and he presented everything very professionally. I work in the medical field and I really take pride in the way I provide customer service to my patients. I feel today people lack knowledge in the meaning of customer service and how important it is because that is really what brings people back. I signed up for a personal trainer as well so I will have to say that Caesar was great in helping me with that. I was also able to meet my trainer Josh, which I must say I am looking forward to training with him. He seemed very energetic and he had a great aura about him. Crossing my fingers that the first impression the staff provided me, is one that will continue on. :)",positive
"I originally transferred from 24 Hour Fitness off of Ann Rd, because I moved to the north side. I actually wish I never did. My top 3 complainants about this gym: 1. Teenagers are EVERYWHERE!!! Don't plan to get a good workout during the summer time when they are out of school. All they do is work out in groups of like 5 and sit on the equipment all day. 2. Equipment is terrible and old. Most of the Free Motion Machine equipment is either missing the proper attachment handles or rigged together in an unsafe manner. This is actually embarrassing, especially when the gym charges you a yearly monthly maintenance fee...what a joke. 3. The dirtiest locker room I've every experienced. If you like to change in a dirt locker room with trash all over the place, then this is the spot for you. Bottom line, if you can treat yourself, spend the extra money and go to 24 Hour Fitness off of Ann. Military, I would just go the Warrior Fitness Center on base...for real!",negative
"Victor the manager at the Gold's Gym in Las Vegas is arbitrarily charging for fees that aren't listed. Victor the manager at the Gold's Gym in Las Vegas is arbitrarily charging for fees that aren't listed. When Victor spoke to me he had a mouthful of food. I waited nearly 10 minutes to speak to someone. Victor told me that I needed to pay an extra $10.00 a month to use the tanning beds. I've been going to Gold's Gym for months, yet no one told me about this. In fact, when I signed up, the salesperson told me I wouldn't have to pay an additional money to use the facilities other than the day care and spin classes. That was a lie to get my membership.",negative
Was strongly thinking about getting a membership here being that it is very close to my house. I have been a golds member in the past. was really not all that impressed with the facility. the customer service was terrible i honestly felt like i was buying a used car! I think im gonna save the money and work out for free at Nellis AFB and just make the drive over there instead.,negative
"Very disappointed in this place. Has gotten ghetto and dirty. There was an altercation with 2 guys where it broke out into a big agreement And THE STAFF DID NOTHING. I talked to one of the guys and he said They didnt do anything because it wasn't their problem IT'S YOUR GYM! AVOID coming here. Too many little kids ""working out."" Weights left all over. Ghetto ppl But it's now only 10 bucks to sign up So I shouldn't be surprised.",negative
"I've been working out here since the summer and I must say I'm a HUGE fan of the cardio cinema! No matter what time of day I go, I can find a machine, watch a movie, and get my cardio on. This place is so clean, too. The locker room is always being mopped and wiped and I've also seen the cleaning gal dusting the workout areas and machines. The child care workers really seem to enjoy what they're doing, and greet my child by name. I've never taken any classes because I'm too embarrassed to trip over my own feet, but I might give Zumba a try. I've even thought of just sitting in the hot tub with a book!",positive
"I should have headed the warnings about Golds billing practices. Golds policy is to charge a ""rate lock fee"" after you have been a member for 120 days. I canceled my membership per their 31 day notice policy, at less than 120 of total membership. They still billed my account the $39 rate lock fee. I disputed the charge and they told me I have to cancel within 60 days in order for my membership to expire before 120 days. That is not what the contract that I signed states. It clearly states must provide 31 day notice within 120 days to avoid rate lock fee. This is why Golds is losing business and has gone from ""the"" gym to empty parking lots. I highly recommend NOT JOINING.",negative
"Love it way more than 24! Personally, I have never had a rude experience with any staff in the 2 mths. I've Been there, but I go to workout not make bff's!",positive
"The Losee location of Golds Gym is amazing. Everything from swimming pool to a basketball court. Fitness classes such as Zumba and MMA are available to your disposal. The staff is very friendly and energetic and the personal trainers are fun to work with to help you reach your ideal body state. If you call Shannon Harris at the Aliante & Centennial location (10 minutes from Centennial and Losee) at 702-396-0800, he'll hook you up with a Golds Gym membership for $0 down, 1st month free, $20 per/mo. after. Call now to make your appointment",positive
I really like the equipment and facility but it is very expensive. The staff is always friendly and helpful. I really wish it was more affordable.,negative
"I really like this gym. It's super clean and the staff is friendly. They have everything you'd need.. great locker room, pool, kid's care, a CINEMA and tons of classes. I do agree with someone who mentioned rates fluctuating. I spoke to three different people and got three different quotes. Try talking to DC.. he's pretty helpful and will work with you. Highly recommend this place. Probably the best gym I've ever been to.",positive
Love it! the classes are so much fun and you dont even feel like you are workig out!! great atmosphere! REALLY busy from 4 to 8... that's why I go at 530 am! lol,positive
"The facility was average but the issue that I had was that they didn't cancel my membership when I called and asked them to. The woman who I spoke to said that I was all set but that was certainly not the case. I used a credit card that I don't use often so I didn't see the reoccurring charges, but eventually rather than calling me about it they sent debt collectors. It was a complete disaster and the only way for me to fight it was to get a lawyer. In the end it was just cheaper to pay them. They are a crooked company so beware!",negative
"Quite possibly the worst Gold's Gym ever. Most of the equipment is ancient by big box gym standards--maybe stuff from the 80s? The squat racks and weight benches in particular are something you might expect to see in a gym at a poorly-funded junior high school. And some of the equipment is in such disrepair that it may be dangerous to use. The layout of the place is terrible, too. There's a giant, unused space between the front desk and the equipment room that could be used for more equipment but instead seems to serve no purpose whatsoever. I've been to other Gold's Gym locations in other states, and the sorry state of equipment at this one in almost unbelievable. The staff is friendly--or at least professional--but otherwise this place is a huge disappointment.",negative
Represents the Gold's chain well! Filled with weights galore and good equipment all around. Is a play ground for the serious body builder.,positive
"So, I've worked out here on and off for years but my health was waning so after about a year of paying and not going, I canceled my membership. Come to find out I needed open-heart surgery. So after a month in the hospital and several months of rehab, I'm feeling great again and I want to get back in real shape. So, I'm thinking I'll go back to Gold's. The day before I return there I get a call from a collection agency and you see where this is going? Did the one star give me away? They dropped a bomb on me to the tune of $299!! I told them they were clearly mistaken, after all, I don't have a membership with Golds. So I call them and lo and behold, my membership wasn't canceled after all. I explained that during my surgery, and subsequent convalescence, I was living on food stamps and Obama Care. Oh and I paid you clowns for a year without setting foot in here. If anything, I'm due a refund. They wouldn't hear any of it. And to top it off, I can't cancel until I pay my back dues and then I'm required to give a month's notice, just so they can stick it to me for one more month? I'm currently working on getting this resolved but it's not looking too promising. Decades of loyalty don't mean squat, apparently. All that aside, I've always been satisfied with Gold's, though it's the only place I know where you put your life in your hands if you cross between a bodybuilder and his mirror in mid-rep. Thank God I have the ability to sweet talk my way out of a fight. And yes, there are monsters there. Massively insecure steroidal lunks and scary Arnie-esque ""women"" who spend at least 4 hrs a day, 364 (they're closed Xmas) days a year in there, but who cares? The question you need to ask is, do you give a sh*t? If you do, go elsewhere and if you do join Gold's, God forbid you fall behind. Let's face it, the people who have money are over at Lifetime.",negative
"Rude! Pushy! Crowded! I went in with a 7 day trial pass and specifically said I wanted to try out the gym. The sales guy was pushy from the beginning, trying to get me to sign up for a membership without even offering me a tour of the gym. I again told him that I would not commit to a gym I hadn't tried out or seen for that matter. He then said ""a gym's a gym"". Great selling point. He then seemed annoyed but gave me a tour when I insisted. I asked what a few of the classes were, he couldn't even tell me. I asked if they have personal training, his reply was ""we're a gym. don't all gyms have personal training? Well, maybe _____ doesn't, but they aren't trying to help anyone."" (insulting another gym). After the ""tour"", he then again tried to push me into a membership. I again was firm and said I wanted to try the gym, so he copped an attitude, gave me my pass, and told me to contact him if I want to sign up. I asked if I could sign up online (why give him commission when he attitude was horrible) and he smarts off ""whatever makes you happy"" then walked away. I then went in the very crowded gym, the eliptical program shut off midway through so I had to start over. I got so irritated I left before my workout was complete.",negative
Super cheap monthly deal-$15 a month and that includes unlimited classes. What else could you want? It is not fancy so if you want a luxury gym this isn't it. But if you're looking for cheap + gym + 24 hours + classes = this is the spot,positive
Let me tell you how the suck you in. It's cheaper and that is what you get cheaper. Equipment is old dirty. If you try to cancel it is a big run around. They charge a cancelation fee and you can only do it on line. Go somewhere else it is not worth a cheaper price.,negative
"This place went from alright to horrible as soon as they lowered their membership fee to $9.99 a month. The gym is now consistently filthy, the machines are always broken, paper towels are never stocked, none of the bar clips in the whole place work, and worse of all, the low membership fees have attracted what seems like every gang member, thug, and eminem wannabe in the area to join. Do yourself a favor and don't waste your time here.",negative
"Eh, I'm really on the fence about this place. It is what it is- this is where the bodybuilders come. These people are *SERIOUS* about their fitness, and it shows. You come here a few nights a week, and you'll see the SAME PEOPLE HERE night after night after night. It can be a little intimidating, and honestly if it wasn't for the fact that my personal trainer works here I would have stayed at my other gym. But it's fine- the biggest complaint that I have is the fact that it's always PACKED. You're going to have to park a ways away at most hours, and there's always a HORDE of people working out here. In all honesty though, I've only rarely ever had to wait for any machines. And anytime I did have to, I was able to just jump in between sets with whoever was on it. This is a big gym, and it seems like they have good facilities and whatnot. I haven't really checked too much into what all they offer, but at some point I'll probably try some of the yoga classes or something. I was a little intimidated the first few times I came here, but now I know my way around well enough to just come in, put in the work, and go home. Everyone I've ever dealt with here has been friendly and professional, so no complaints on that front. They could do a better job of picking up all of the paper towels that people throw on the ground after wiping the machines... but hey, at least people are cleaning the machines (even if they can't clean up after themselves... hashtag paradox).",positive
"I am giving this gym 1 star because of the General Manager Charles Kern!! Rude doesn't begin to describe the attitude he had with me over disputing a Fee on my account that wasn't supposed to be there. Threatened to forcefully remove me from the gym. Threatened to call the cops! Constantly cut me off while talking, and said little demeaning remark and comments. This guy is a coward beyond words! Worst management ever if this is the face of your establishment!!! I was a Member of this Gym for 2yrs, and just because I am not a member anymore he didn't even want to talk to me.. The Gym itself is nice, basic Golds Gym. Go in lift weights and get out. But if you are even remotely considering going to this gym. DONT!!!!!",negative
I canceled my membership months in advance due to the fact the gym was in constant disrepair. Come to find out they never canceled the membership. The representative I called was not helpful and I had to leave a message with a supervisor. He also didn't put me on hold and I could be hear him speaking about how he wanted to get laid that night. Listen dude I am all for people getting laid but cancel my membership when I ask please! I really wish I didn't have to give them one star. STAY AWAY!,negative
"While I enjoyed actually working out at this gym, if you value your sanity and credit rating, never, ever, join Gold's Gym! I cancelled my membership months ago and paid in full, but their collection agency will not stop harassing me! Gold's and Swift collections work together to rip you off and ruin your credit. They have an F rating from the Better Business Bureau. Wish I had checked before I joined.",negative
"I am in full agreement with others about the equipment condition. Though I get a good workout because of the variety, there are MANY repair issues as evident in all the ""broken signs"" that seem to stay on the machines forever. Even machines that work could use maintenance. I had been a member 10 years ago and will say that when I came back 5 months ago because of my daughters request, it was a deja vu.....NOTHING has changed. As for cleanliness, the place could use a really good cleaning especially the bathrooms. There are many customers at this location so I cannot imagine the repair/cleanliness issue is to blame on financial reasons. This is obviously a poorly managed location and I have written to corporate 2 months ago with no reply.",negative
"Good gym - has everything I need, though it is packed at night during the week. Don't be fooled by their ""4 free personal trainer sessions"" when you sign up though. Those sessions are nothing more than a way for them to give you a sales pitch to sign a personal trainer contract. I had one session that lasted about ten minutes and when I called to conform my 2nd session, the trainer flaked and cancelled on me and never called to reschedule. I'm fairly sure he was getting the feeling I wasn't going to be signing a personal trainer contract so he bailed thinking he was wasting his time. Not cool. Again, great gym but don't expect to use any ""free"" personal trainer sessions unless you want to fight to get them, which I didn't care to.",negative
"Golds Gym SUCKS!! Manager told me he was going to cancel membership, failed to do so. He doesn't even have the balls to call me. What a pussie!!!!!!!!!!!!!",negative
"What first drew me into this gym was the price thinking ""It's either too good to be true or the gym's quality is the reason why it's cheap"". I went to check the place out and I got to take a look around. It literally took me 5 minutes to decide I wanted to join this gym and 4 months later, I still have no regrets. I'm not picky so the very few worn down equipment didn't lose me as long as its still does its job efficiently. What I love about this gym is the atmosphere. Mostly everyone in this gym is extremely friendly especially the employees. It's truly a humbling place to workout at because everyone there is very considerate of people working out around them. There's rarely anyone who thinks they're so much better than the other. And I believe that this type of atmosphere came from the great employees that work there. Not every gym out there has all their equipment perfectly running 24/7. Of course stuff happens and equipment breaks down from time to time. But Golds has an abundant amount of other equipment to adjust to for your workouts and they constantly try to find ways to make our visits convenient. What does bring me down a bit is when female custodians clean the men's locker room, making me wait forever to get in. But at least they're really nice about it haha",positive
"Go to gym to train and apparently I need the GMs permission to use the fitness room when there isn't a class in progress. How the heck can you say that I need permission to use a part of a gym that I'm paying membership for? You have all my personal information on file, you know more about me than I know about you. So this can't be a trust/ security issue. What a waste of time.",negative
"This Golds is much bigger than the one in Tukee, and nicer too. The employees up front are always nice, there is plenty of equipment to use. They even have a special workout area for women here so girls don't have to feel creeped out by dudes checking them out, which I know is a big complaint for most women at gyms. I want to give it 5 stars, but the gym is really busy at the start of the week, and most weekdays it can be a little difficult to find a parking space, but that's not exactly something Golds could improve upon but worth mentioning. For $15/mo you can't lose.",positive
"I lift things up, I put them down. I lift things up, I put them down. Staff is friendly. The only thing that annoys me are the *cough*women*cough* who are there when I go. Sitting on machines for 10 minutes and only doing one set of 5 reps. The women who sweat all over equipment and never wipe them down after using them. And the dumb chick with her purse by her, texting on her cell phone while wearing flip flops. Because like omg, she couldn't like tear herself away from her Facebook or twitter or Instagram or texting her Beiber boyfriend. Pick up your paper towels too!!!!!!",positive
"This gym is pretty old but everything is well maintained. This place is great for bodybuilders, it's big, has old school equipment, metal weights. There is a unbelievable amount of different equipment. Over all great gym, check it out if your looking for a place that will help you get results. You can't beat the price either. 10 bucks a month to use over a hundred machines and free weights. They have a kids area. And the gym is never crowded, although I'm never there at 5pm.",positive
"I'm not a member of a gym but I wanted to take a look around and see what this one had to offer. When I asked the girl behind the counter if I could look at what they have she would not let me go in without filling out a bunch of BS paperwork. I'm sure it was so that some guy could walk me around, waste my very precious time talking about things I already know, and try to persuade me to join their gym. That's not what I wanted. I already had my decision made that if I saw the equipment I wanted to use that I would go ahead & join. I just wanted to run in & out quickly while I had a free minute to do so and check it out. Oh well, I figure I just saved myself some time and money with this place. I used to be with LA Fitness. They are wonderful! I think I may check out the Gilbert Rec Center & see what they have. I'm sure they won't mind me taking a look. If not, I'll head back to LA which I highly recommend.",negative
"I went in to this location sign up with my girlfriend. First thing I noticed while walking through the door was the horrible smell. This made me then look around briefly and I saw how filthy the entrance floor was. I can only imagine the inside of the gym. I did not make it that far. After talking for maybe 2 minutes to the steroid driven 'manager?', I realized just how friendly the staff was going to be. I asked a few questions about pricing so clearly they thought I was some kind of 'Corporate Shopper' and answered every question with a Joker like laugh, not a smile. 24 Hr Fitness is our new gym and we couldn't be happier. Clean, updated and a truly friendly staff from the entrance to the cleaning locker.",negative
"My wife and I have been members of the Gold's Gym in Gilbert, AZ Gym number: 0175 for going on a year. I have to say that the gym has degraded quite a bit since we have joined. The gym seems to have over enrolled to the point that there are not enough parking spaces during peak hours causing people to ""create"" parking spots. The cardio equipment is dilapidated at best, when we first joined there were six elliptical trainers since then two were removed due to malfunction and the four that are left are barely running and a couple are not level. I am currently in contact with Gold's Corporate to see if there is any way that I can cancel the rest of my contract so that I can join a gym with adequate and functional equipment.",negative

"I wish the change in the temperatures was actually true. Today, it's 76. In October. The cardio area is even hotter, as it's located behind large glass windows without adequate film to block the sunlight. Is 76 degrees REALLY an improvement???",negative
Great gym. Small and intimate enough so that you aren't getting intimidated. It's very clean and the staff is very friendly. I stopped going to fitness connection over this gym.,positive
"This location needs to be more clear on their website about club hours. This facility is open at 9:00 am for out of town guests. My membership dues cover all gyms, however, I was unable to work out at my usual time of 6:30 am, because this facility operates more like a fitness center than a gym. Planet Fitness is more a of a gym than this particular facility.",negative
"When I first started going to this gym I thought it had the potential to be 5-Stars but as I have continued my membership my expectation decreased. I think my initial dissatisfaction really started from day one, but I had a hope that things would get better. Despite its lack of a stretch area, and classes, we signed up for this small gym 20 mins from our house. We should've have listened to our gut because this gym still has not lived up to the potential it could have. On the initial day we signed up we voiced our concerns to the desk clerk. She ensured that any problems we had would be resolved with the arrival of their new location. She confirmed that the bigger location would have a better stretch area, more classes, and an overall larger facility. For the price you pay for this small location, we could easily be at a gym with more amenities. But, the idea we could transition into a new and bigger gym, made us okay settling for a few months. As time has gone on, we have realized we were set up. It has been almost a year since we first signed up, and the larger facility is no where near completion. I drove past the supposed ""new facility"" earlier this afternoon, and the building is still in shambles. The old sign is up, and there is still full construction needed inside. The desk clerk lied to us from day one. Because I am still within my ""one year"" contract, I will reluctantly continue to use this small facility. I will continue to pay a high membership fees, for amenities similar to a bargain gym. But, once my membership is over I'm out. There is no point paying such high fees for a gym full of sleazy salesmen (women). Buyer Beware: There are several other gyms in the area with better amenities, better machines, more variety of classes, better service, and better prices. There really isn't any point of joining this gym, as it does nothing to outshine the other gyms in the area.",negative
"Awful experience. I tried to cancel membership back in November 2015 by going to the Golds Gym 28269 location on 4 different occasions between the times of 3-5pm. Every time no one was working the front desk. I called and obviously cancelled payment from my cc because its not my job to hunt one of their staff members down to cancel. I received a call 2 weeks ago asking for a new payment method since I owed $86. I called the lady back in there accounting and told her the story that I hadn't been to the gym in over 3 months and wouldn't be paying 86 dollars when I tried 4 separate times to come in and cancel. Just now I received a call from Susan apparently the extremely rude GM of all Charlotte location? She told me she ""pulled"" records for all her staff for the past 4 months and all her staff was on duty apparently every time I came in and saw no one? I told her I did my part and tried to cancel the way they asked, by going in and signing and paying a balance from back in Nov.. She then told me shes got to figure out how shes going to ""make me"" pay this $86.. WOW. I asked her why is she being so rude to a customer? She said I am trying to figure out whats going on? I said its very clear Susan...I tried to come in and cancel my membership and you didn't have your facility appropriately staffed because no one was working the 4 times I came in. She then tried to keep arguing with me and told me i MUST have come in all 4 times on a Friday when her staff leaves at 2pm. Instead of going on arguing with the ""Golds Gyms GM"" - I just asked her for Kevins number assuming he would be professional in that he owns the gym. She told me you cant have his number but I'll give you his email and hes going to tell you the exact same thing - well I've emailed him twice about this already and no response back from him? Is this really how people operate businesses? And really a GM trying to contentiously argue with a customer? Note to Kevin - Susan needs some customer service skills.",negative
"BUYER BEWARE: I contacted this gym last spring inquiring about a temporary membership and was induced to sign up for a year because if I moved (as I fully expected to, told the staff member, and eventually did--out of state), I would be able to get out of the contract. I relied on the word of a staff member who, of course, is no longer with the company. The staff is misinformed (even the current staff, who advised me two days ago that a USPS change of address confirmation would suffice--only to be told by management when I provided such confirmation that that person was ""new"" and ""misunderstood the cancellation policy,"") and even though the Owner concedes this fact, he accepts no responsibility for it. [In case you are wondering, the contract, which has quite a different cancellation policy than what was sold to me by the staff member, is presented to you via touchscreen--extraordinarily difficult if not impossible to read--and the hard copy is only given to you after you sign and after you pay.] There are constant emails from staff advising of corrections to the now-reduced spinning schedule, problems with equipment not working properly, etc. The equipment is dirty even though during my visits there I saw very few people. This place is not even remotely worth the hassle, and frankly the fact that management induces students--people with little to no income like myself--to sign contracts that they cannot get out of makes me sick. Please spend your money with people who actually care about doing the right thing. 11/13/15 Update: Here is my response to owner Kevin's comment below: ""Kevin, to confirm, I have already reached out. Here was part of your response: 'I left you a detailed VM regarding the situation. Listen Michelle I know what you say you heard and what you were told but I don't believe my staff would tell you that a cell phone bill would work, especially when it lists out all of the accepted items on the contract. MIchelle if you tell ten people the same something and then ask them to recall it 6 months later, you will get 10 different answers, hence why we have paper contracts that don't require interpretation or memory. It is in large bold print that is underlined. I am sorry but you are going to be held to what you agreed to do per the contract.' "" Interestingly, I later called the gym, was told by a staff member that an address change confirmation would work, obtained such documentation & sent it to you, and received a call from Susan Simko advising that the staff member was ""new"" and ""made a mistake."" So, you see, it IS possible that your staff misinform people. And it is nothing short of wrong that you hold students with little to no income to contracts based on misrepresentations made by your staff. Also Kevin, I will be filing a complaint with the AG's office regarding Gold's (Arbor Creek) unethical practices. It's possible nothing will come of it, but hopefully by posting this, more people will be brave enough to complain. People like me have few resources to fight back (this is why you solicit students, right?), but I will use all available resources to protect my money. Which really isn't even mine--it comes from the government. So congratulations.",negative
"Dirty. Arrogant, nasty owner. Disengaged staff. Employees actually sit in the office and eat cheeseburgers. Stay away.",negative
"This was the first gym that I joined when I moved to Vegas 4 years ago. At first I was apprehensive about going and a little embarrassed because of my weight. The day I walked in I was greeted with a big smile from Travis, fitness coordinator. He made me feel welcomed and asked me to pick a trainer on the wall. I picked Adrian and she worked me out, I almost passed out the first day because I was way out of shape. I went back to the gym everyday and had training twice a week for 6 weeks. I started seeing results and it felt great. I'd like to say Hi to the great staff. Thanks again to Travis, Adrian, Maria, Chris and Fred!!!",positive
"I have never used a personal trainer here, so keep that in mind. This place is pretty much like most other gyms...it's a gym. Has plenty of equipment, most of which is in great shape. Like most gyms out there, NO DAY IS LEG DAY, so the upper body equipment is hard to come by at peak hours. However, this is great when it is indeed leg day. I appreciate the fact that they have three squat racks (my old gym only had one), unless someone is doing curls on it...smh. This place can be a zoo during peak hours, but that is understood. Theyre in the business of making money, hence the more memberships the better. Good highway location and nice staff.",positive
"Pros: -clean facility, been here a while and it's always clean -staff is nice. Understanding and easy going. Helpful when needed. -affordable. Any golds gym in the world for only $15 a month and no contract. Annual fee of $40. It's quite affordable from what I've seen around the country. Though admittedly some of the more expensive gyms around here are legitimately better. If you only care about price this is a good place to go. Cons: -every day is chest day here. It is ridiculously hard to get a good clean chest day here. You will always be waiting on someone. - Gym etiquette is not enforced here. Weights are constantly in the wrong spot. Weight trees will have several different weights on one limb so you have to dig through 45 and 25 lb plates if you want a 10 or a 5 (obviously that's not always the exact scenario, the point is you often have to remove one weight to get to another because people just put them wherever, instead Of together with like weights.) ALWAYS ALWAYS ALWAYS have to remove other people's weights when you get to a machine. It is a combination of the guests being very inconsiderate and lazy and also the staff being a little lazy. I know it's intimidating for a staff member to approach a guest and ask them to put their weights back when finished but that's what balls are for and it's apparent none of the staff has any. If the gym etiquette was fixed here I would call the gym a 4 star gym for cleanliness and kindness of staff but gym etiquette is a huge part of the gym experience and it's severely lacking here. This is old school super basic gym etiquette and it's not being taught or enforced at all. Without some kind of order and regulation people will just do whatever they want and usually the path of least resistance is lazy and inconsiderate of others. There's more to managing a gym than solely focusing on sales and wiping down the equipment. Just being honest.",negative
"I was never much of gym person that I thought I would take out a membership, but I'm really liking this place. Although I have been working out at this Golds for almost a couple weeks. The equipment is good, there are a lot of programs, the staff has been exceptional and the facility is clean. I seem to always get time on device even at peak hours if any very little wait. I gave Jason my business he's been really straight up and always available if I had questions. Thanks Golds!",positive
"Ok. Ok. This review is months overdue. I moved to the area in January and was looking for a gym. I had been a member of Golds gym in the past and this was my first option. I didn't have to shop around, the price was better than I had previously. Ofcourse any gym wouldn't be a gym, if they didn't offer the other programs available. I thought here I go, but after talking to Benjamin my attitude changed. I told him my goals and the trouble I had in the past and my concerns of putting back on the 40+ pounds that I had recently lost. Hence the reason for joining a gym rather than using the free gum at my apartment complex. I was loosing my motivation and needed help. He suggested that I would benefit from a personal trainer. I signed on for one day a week for a year. My first trainer, Kalinda was great,but she moved and I inherited Nick. Nick is awesome. He gives a lot of useful information. He stress the importance of diet and correct form. I am totally worn out after each workout, but I feel great. I know that I would have seen more results if I follow his eating recommendations, but old habits are hard to break. I'm a work on progress. All of the trainers are helpful. They definitely lend a helping hand if they see someone doing an exercise incorrectly. Nor are they are pushing. Each time that I've went the facility is cleaned or was being cleaned. Granted there are times where it's busy and getting on machines not knowing if they had been wiped down. No problem, there are paper towels and spray conviently located throughout the gym. Once my water bottle fell, the top came off, and water went everywhere, even on another patron (sorry). The cleaning lady stopped what she was doing and cleaned up my mess. I have been in many times where the cleaning crew was busy wiping down machines, mopping, dusting, cleaning bathrooms, and so on. Since being a member of Golds I have not had any problems. Lots of classes to choose from. The staff is professional and you get a warm greeting each time you come in. The ladies at the front desk aknowledge you coming in and going out. I have been to the other Gold gyms around town and this one is my favorite.",positive
Watch out for the $54.99 yearly membership Gold's Gym charges it's in the contract and the salespeople don't mention it - then tag on the membership and you're at about $20 per month- they don't have a pool or spa and maintenance is inconsistent kinda dirty; sticking with LVAC after two years you can pay yearly which averages out to $12 per month and it's much cleaner. Glad I'm canceling.,negative
TOTAL SCAM! Watch out. Tried to charge me ridiculously after my year contract was up. I canceled and yet they continued to charge me. I had to cancel for a second time after giving them more money for their mistake. WATCH OUT! It was perfect while I was there and turned way down. I wish it was the gym I had originally joined. Now this is just another greedy gym with no ethics.,negative
"I have been a member at this gym since it has been open. In the beginning it was a great gym to go to. Since then, new management has come into place, the gym has become over crowded and the bathrooms are not kept clean. They have also started charging maintenance fees, however the machines are always broken. The lack of customer service at the front desk on Saturday mornings during prime time is a dissatisfaction. If you sign up for the $10/month you get what you pay for, but as a long time member, the gym has gone downhill.",negative
"This location just continues to go downhill. I have been a member since it opened. Originally it was great. I was paying $25 and the classes were always busy, but not packed. Ever since they started this $9.99 a month the place has completely changed. The classes are overcrowded during peak hours. You can barely move in classes like zumba and kickboxing, and the spin classes are always full (so you have to get there 15 minutes before to wait in line). SInce some people only pay $9.99 a month and don't have access to classes, they want to stamp your hand to take a class. The stamp doesn't wash off right away and I don't need to look like a was at a club the night before when I show up for work. Luckily, they only ask for a stamp 5% of the time so you can just ignore them. The crowd at this gym has totally changed since the $9.99 special. Obviously this has brought the gym more money, but the people who are paying $20-25 a month are going to start leaving. This is something me and my husband are seriously considering at this point.",negative
"WAS a gr8 gym when i joined 8/13. New ownership has raped it. Over crowded with ""trainers"", equipment in disrepair and no staff on the floor enforcing posted policies. If $10/month is what you can afford it's worth it otherwise pay a little more and you won't have to wait on arrogant trainers (not all but a majority) who think they own the place since there are no employees on the floor to advise them otherwise. MOST IMPORTANTLY if you upgrade your membership READ THE CONTRACT. They'll lie to your face and the next thing you know you're locked in for 1 year. It's very apparent that ownership will not reinvest $$ into the gym. Been there since AUG 2013 and there is not 1 single piece of new equipment, fixtures or stitch of an upgrade anywhere to be found. People abuse equipment because there are no staff personnel on the floor other than cleaning. Which I do give them credit, the place is clean...if you discount the broken and stench ridden urinal in the men's locker room that took +2 weeks to repair. Witnessed a staff member pouring muratic acid in it on several occasions.",negative
Visited this gym BC admission was free with my hotel stay at the Townplace Marriott Suites. I got there in the afternoon during the week and it was busy. Started off by warming up on an older treadmill and then made my way to weight training machines. There's a decent amount of equipment but I found the layout quite strange with equipment in smaller rooms and many machines lacked grips and were totally unusable. another quirk was I didn't see any hand sanitizer dispenser which my gym in So Cal offers. The place seems worn out and a bit dirty and could use some TLC!,negative
"Sign up in January and I was loving the staff and vibe so I signed up with a trainer. My trainer left 4 weeks after I started with him. It took 4 weeks to get me a new trainer after 3 calls 1 email and empty promises. So I gave the new trainer a shot, hurt myself the first time out, had a second session and it was ok, clearly he was not engaged, nice guy though. I got the flu then my work hours changed. Working 6 days a week 10-12 hours a day doesn't leave time for a work out. So I tried to cancel.... NO, I have 8 months left in my contact. I'm like really I've gotten only 6 work out in since January and you've gotten free money from me and because of my work they won't let me out. tI said then get me a trainer who can work out when I'm available cause I'm in management and my hours fluctuate, haven't heard from them.... DONT SIGN UP FOR THERE TRAINING ITS A COMPLETE RIP OFF.......IM DISGUSTED AND DISCOURAGED.... I'm in healthcare and to be honest they don't care about your well being just making sales quotas.",negative
"I would like to say the receptionist megan was nice- second the set up was all right, thsy definitely need to update their free weight it reminds me of old school. The trainers seem to be out of shape to be personal trainers. The bathrooms soom to be not clean garbage overflowing, lot of old creepy dudes staring with mustaches and only have one weight scale. No towels provided didnt see sanitizer spray for the machines.",negative
"It's that time of the year when the gym is packed of course with the ""New Year Resolutioners"" But I can't complain. Heck, I was one of them last year! So fast forward 12 months, I've come to appreciate this gym! I stuck to my fitness plan and reached my fitness goal for the year!. This location is my favorite. It's clean, doesn't stink like sweaty bodies, there's plenty of parking space. The staff here is friendlier. Ive met cool people and gained new friends, and I'm a fan of the group fitness classes they offer here. The membership I signed up for included unlimited group fitness classes at Gold's Gym. This location here at Stephanie offers the most group classes. It's a no brainer taking advantage of what they have for the membership price I got. They have classes for every level, low or high impact, some even designed for seniors! My favorites are the dance fitness classes. Love Hot Hula Fitness! It's like a bit of Polynesian dancing, alot of cardio! It's a great core workout! It's not high impact, it's not hot, temperature wise, but you'll sweat! The class isnt too crowded, so there's more room to move. The instructor provides the ""lava lava"" no special shoes needed, since you workout in bare feet. They welcome walk ins, and even if you are a few minutes late, or running on Hawaiian time like me... no worries, the class is easy to follow. The Zumba classes are really popular too, especially the evening sessions, but don't get discouraged if it looks too crowded, you'll manage to move! ... but come early if you prefer to be at the front of the class. Wear comfy gym clothes and shoes. Bring water...that goes for anytime you come to the gym...that and a towel is a must!!! Most classes are an hour but you'll have so much fun, it'll fly by! It's never too late, you don't have to be a New Years resolutioner to come try one of the classes they offer I encourage everyone to get into the ""fit life!"" Happy 2014!",positive
They have every possible equipment you could possibly need to work out. The only downfall to this gym is that its so crowded so if you have a workout routine its hard to follow it because you always need to wait for equipment to free up. It is a lot less busy later in the night around 9-10 but if you dont mind the crowd and waiting for machines to free up this gym is excellent!,positive
This was an okay gym. Its smaller than some of their other gyms . So if your trying to lift be prepared to wait. If your looking to do cardio there more machines than you can shake a stick at .,negative
Love this gym! Professional and courteous staff. Impeccable equipment and all around useful gym. Staff are competent and equipment is clean and in good repair. Great Price for a great work out,positive
This is one of the nicer Golds Gyms in the Vegas area. It is a little smaller than the Eastern & Serene gym. It has plenty of equipment and weights. They keep it clean. It is way to far from Summerlin Though. They need to open a Golds around the Charleston & I-215 area.,positive
"First of all, I've had memberships to LVAC, LA Fitness (when I lived in California), Gold's Gym and Planet Fitness. So when I write this review, it's about the actual gym I currently go to and my experiences in comparison to other corporate type gyms. I enrolled a little less than a year ago with no expectations. Simple gym, I knew my way around it and I knew what to expect from it's clientele. I had no major issues except for the fact that is was not disclosed verbally that there was some kind of ""account maintenance"" fee of $60. Since hubby and I signed up at the same time, I was kinda shocked to see the $120 hit at the same time. Come to find out, that fee is in the contract that we sign upon signing up. Pros: 1) Always clean, never and issues with the overall cleanliness. Now, I've worked out at several gyms throughout the valley and if anyone thinks this one is dirty, then go to what I call the OCD gym (Planet Fitness). I felt like people were more focused on sanitizing their machines than actually using them for fitness. 2) Extremely friendly staff. Never felt pressured to buy anything/add on services, etc. I've always been acknowledged by someone and never made to feel like I didn't fit in. 3) The childcare is AMAZING!! The first couple of weeks of putting my little one in there kinda freaked me out - - but now almost a year later, I look forward to the hour and a half or so where they play with her and give her great attention (as with all the other kids in the playroom). Never had any problems with them. In fact, I belong to several mommy forums on FB and through some posts, have heard not so nice things about childcare at other gyms. I personally know 2 people who have moved gyms because their children were either traumatized at those gyms or hurt and no one seemed to care. The childcare staff are always so friendly and sweet. 4) If you know how to use the equipment, you can ALWAYS find a machine no matter how crowded it gets. Some people assume you can only use certain things (like the squat rack). Maybe they need 2 squat racks because there always seems to be a wait for it. But seriously, if you can't afford a trainer, google info on how to use machines - you'd be amazed how quickly you can go through a workout without having to wait for others...and only to complain that it's too crowded. 5) Trainers (well at least mine) seem very professional and informative. But I think finding a trainer is like finding a doctor - you gotta keep looking till you find someone that works for you and understands your needs. Also, they're actually personable. When I worked out at LVAC they were independent and man, some were so unapproachable, they were kinda intimidating. 6) NOT a meat market!! IF anyone calls this place a meat market, then obviously they have been to at least 2 of the gyms I named above. At LVAC I was one of the few women who did squats and deadlifts. Here, there are quite a few and I look to them for inspiration because these are not the type of women who look like they're there to pick up a man. Just because I said it wasn't it meat market, that doesn't mean there aren't hotties there! Still lots of great eye candy!! CONS 1) I think the staff should walk around the gym and a few should actually SHOW newbies how to use the machines. Yeah you wanna increase your membership but perhaps by showing the inexperienced people how to use the machines without having to commit to a trainer will help retain members. I see so many people give up because they aren't achieving their goals, but don't know where to turn or ask for advice so just...leave. Maybe have a ""class"" on how to use machines. THEN once they figure it out, introduce them to personal training and how effective if would/could be? 2) Equipment breaks down frequently. I do see someone always repairing machines, but because the gym is a lot smaller than LVAC (which has like a hundred treadmills alone), either upgrade machines or repair in a timely manner. 3) You guys need a smoothie bar. lol. So I don't have to drive to go get one!! 4) Wish it had a steam room. :) That's it for now. Bottom line, I like my gym and have no issues!!",positive
"I like Golds Gym on Stephanie because they have this cool cardio cinema...That being said, they do not have the movie list updated on their website (Still lists movies for the months of JUNE and it's now AUGUST). I called, and was told ""Yeah...They don't really update it. They might get to it later this month"". WHAT?? I like to check online the day I want to work out and will schedule my workouts according to what movies are playing. I was told to ""JUST STOP IN, AND YOU CAN SEE THE LIST ON THE WALL"". Come on people, update your online movie list!!",negative
"this is MY gym. Been coming here since early 2011. Its nicer than the other Gold's I've been to in the area. Just avoid the 5-7 pm rush if you can. It gets slammed in there. I don't particularly care for Gold's gym as a company though, they're kinda sheisty and make everything a pain in the a$$. If you lose your debit card, and have direct payments...you'll see what I mean.",positive
"This is by far one of the best gyms I've been to. I've signed up there twice now since I was going to college and I've had no problems at all. The girls that signed me up explained everything very and there weren't any ""hidden fees."" Sometimes it's a bit crowded, but seriously what gym isn't. I've never had to wait longer than 5mins to use a machine/bench/etc. Everyone there seems super friendly and I haven't ran into anyone that was rude that works out there or works there. It does suck if you forget your towel though so DON'T FORGET!!! Leaving a machine sweaty is gross so hey no one can really complain about that",positive
"Back in Jan 2013 I visited the S Stephanie location to inform someone that I would need to freeze/suspend my account temporarily. I was told by a young lady that it would be fine. I left, unaware that I was supposed to have been given documentation. Unfortunately since I never worked for Gold's Gym I don't know their procedures. A month later I received a bill in the mail for them. I called member services and asked for it to be corrected. Since he couldn't help me he transferred me and I ended up leaving a voice mail. No one ever called me back and I forgot about it until I received another bill in the mail. I called member services again and it was the same thing, the initial rep couldn't help me so she transferred me to someone else. I briefly spoke with someone and she said she would look into it and call me back. I never received the call so I called back almost 2 weeks later. This time she was rude about my situation, saying that if I didn't have proof of the encounter (how do you prove a conversation?) that I would just have to pay it. I asked her to forward me to her boss. She didn't but she forward me to another woman, whom I ended up leaving a message. She called back, I explained my situation, she said she would research it and call me back. She never did so I called her back twice and left 2 different voice mails. On the third attempt I got a man's voice mail (it had been changed). I left a message with him anyway, and I still did not receive a call back. I then tried to get the issue resolved through the local level (general manager Christopher Wagner) via email but that proved to be useless as I had to explain myself THREE DIFFERENT TIMES about my situation. After I realized I was ""chasing my tail"" I submitted a comment on Gold's Gym website and someone from corporate called me. She said she would get with the local location and find out what's going on. Apparently the location is not cooperating with their corporate because I have yet to hear anything back and I have called her back for follow up (she had nothing at that time). When I spoke with Chris today he mentioned that I am 90 days delinquent (which would be $90) yet I, somehow owe them $180. They are also having a third party make threatening phone calls to me, which I ended up having to block because it was THAT BAD! I don't have a problem paying the CORRECT amount I owe, but I refuse to be extorted for additional funds! I said all that to say this: BEWARE. They are VERY eager to get you in the door and signed up without telling you their guidelines and P&Ps, expecting YOU to figure it out on your own. They snatch your hard-earned money quicker than you can actually make it and won't blink twice about it. They are a business that is out only to make money and contrary to what they may tell you in their ""spiel"" to get your signature THEY DO NOT CARE ABOUT YOU AS A PERSON, AS A MEMBER, AND/OR AS A CONSUMER. Do yourself a favor and try another gym like 24 Hour Fitness or Las Vegas Athletic Club. I'm sure either can't be worse than Gold's Gym.",negative
"It the start of another year, and hopefully I don't physically breakdown like my former company's mainframe computer. Oh well, I did for a month, but what the heck even a Chevy 454 big block engine that fell on my knees a few weeks ago, isn't stopping me this year. The wonders of a great knee brace, Bromlein, and a few other natural inflammatory had me back into a gym. I have to admit a few years ago, I wasn't a fan of Golds because they always had message of something waiting to be repaired on some of their most popular machines, but after that one week pass a few months ago, and watching how quickly the maintenance personnel are on the fix. This is not a problem for me. The misconception of Golds is that the majority of their members are bunch of roid raging meatheads who love looking that themselves in the mirrors. I believe LVAC has more to those types in the free weight room, and this Golds location is now getting more mom's, high school students, and general population that wants deals, but not get locked into a long term contract. Also, it's not a meat market, because most of the guys just want to workout, and get the heck out of there. in other words, it's not a social club, like other gyms. Back in December, I signed up for the 14.99 special, and I'm enjoying this gym quite a bit. The membership package I selected gives me one guest pass each day, and I can walk into any of their Las Vegas location. There also a 9.99 month to month deal, but your stuck at this location, which isn't a bad thing at all. For both of these plans, you still have visitation passes for their other Golds Gyms around the world. Something that the Meat shop on Eastern/215 can't not match up. So if you do travel outside of Nevada, this is another bonus. The gym has everything you need for a workout, and what I enjoy the most in the workout area...The television are put up high on the wall, so they won't break my concentration. but there are a bunch of televisions in the cardio area. I have to admit, there less machines than LVAC, but a few years ago, I never use machine at all. How time, and age has changed that, but Golds has enough machines to keep me happy. What got me to sign the dotted line for this gym was the Cardio theater. I never ever thought the concept of watching a film and spinning away would greatly cut the effort of burning calories. The room is the size of a very large screening room, and has a mix of bikes, stairmasters, and treadmills. Good grief, I was forced to watch ""Twilight"" one day, and even that made the cardio easier to do. Thankfully, my friend's daughter was there with me. and told me the ending of that movie, Sorry, I wasn't about to sit for that entire vampire movie, and see a bunch of hybrid dogs and bats battle it out for some woman. Gold isn't a bad deal at all, but AT&T reception does suck in the area; so I been having a hardest time checking in for Yelp. If you have any doubts about this gym, just get a 7 day pass...it's doesn't cost you anything to check it out for a week.",positive
"I really like this gym. Provides a lot of classes. Convenient, hassle free. Body Compat was awesome. No complaints really. The price is reasonable and I feel at home there. Its not snooty or intimating like David Barton Gym and it has everything you need",positive
"Having been a member of a national chain gym in the past, I was a bit skeptical about joining Golds and dealing with the hassle of contracts and parking and busy machines. Not so here, I'll say: I love going to this gym! 1. No annual contract: that was the biggest pain dealing with during my last membership at a different gym, I don't know if I'm going to be living somewhere for however many years and canceling is a PAIN IN THE ya know! They have good deals at Golds, for me it was 19.95$/mo for access to all classes and gyms nationwide and only a $40 yearly maintenance fee - I can deal with that. No hidden fees crap! AND I get to bring a friend free every time I go to the gym, I have taken advantage of this option almost every time, and it's really great! 2 for 1 and workout with a friend! My friend likes it so much, he's getting his own membership! 2. Cardio cinema - what else is there to say, this is so cool and such a fun easy way to get cardio in!! I wish it were open past 10 pm and it is annoying to have to stop my workout to ask them to reset the movie, but I'm being picky now... 3. Good classes, I've done body combat, yoga, yoga bootcamp (Rasa is awesome, I wish this class was offered more!!), Zumba, body pump and some others, they are all great! Seems to be a good community where teachers recognize you and they have fun Halloween and party kickoff classes. Variety of options and times and if I want more, there's always the Eastern location... 4. They do a good job of maintaining the place. I've been a member since August 2012 and since then, they have replaced the padding on some machines and also fixed one of the TVs that had been out. I have not tried the showers or sauna, but the locker rooms have always been clean, and same goes for the rest of the gym. There's plenty of parking and even on peak times, like 6 pm on weekdays, there's usually not much wait for a weight machine and I've always been able to find an elliptical in the cinema room. It never feels really busy, which is great! I'm a big fan of this gym, I will be a member here for the long term!",positive
"So, I call Gold's gym this morning asking what time they start Cardio Cinema. The guy who answered the phone said that he had already started running it. This was at 4:48AM. I pull up their website and it shows the scheduled movie was to be Twilight. (So, what? Bite me!) Anyway, I get suited up, and head on over. When I get there, the entry sty is jammed and he doesn't know how to fix it. Strike one. I brought my driver's license because I could not readily find my swipe dealy, but I asked him if I had lost it and got a new one, will I still be able to recall the credit I had in the old one. He did not know. Strike two. So I made way to the cardio room, and see that they are screening the A-team, yesterday's movie. I go back outside the door to check the movie schedule which is supposed to display the immediate 3 days including the current, and all the slots are empty. No, no strike three yet, although it should be. I go back to the desk, and ask the guy what the next movies were. He did not know, nor did he have a hard copy of the month's schedule, nor did he not know how to go online and check the schedule, nor did he not know today's date. Strike 3,4,5. and 6. Does that guy even work there? I mean, maybe that's his father's job and he's across the street drinking, and he left his kid there with his work shirt. But that guy definitely does not deserve to be working there, if he doesn't know anything.

"Just the name 'Golds Gym' has always intimidated me. I had the impression that the place was full of juice head muscle men and that there would be no actual, normal looking people working out. Not that musclemen are bad, I just didnt want to be the only gangly armed wimp in the joint. A friend from San Antonio absolutely raves about her Golds Gym, and the classes that she takes there. She is addicted. I almost rolled my eyes at her for loving such a sweaty smelling scary place. Until she had me come with her to a Body Combat class at my local Golds. I was hooked. The one hour I spent burning 9 million calories sent my body into overdrive and I LIKED feeling the burn. Another friend of mine and I signed up that very day. My friend has gone back to San Antonio sadly, and it took awhile for other friend and I to get on track and actually step foot in the scary place without our tough Texas girl. But, we have, and now we understand the addiction. We finally had our orientation session, where we were educated on nutrition, and focused on short and long term goals. I like having goals. Their daycare is nicely lit, clean, and the front desk and daycare staff is always friendly. Oh, and there are normal looking people like me EVERYWHERE. The cardio cinema is a BLAST, though sometimes I'm glad it's super dark in there when I have a random outburst of laughter when watching the movie. Everyone else in their zones. The womens area has great equipment and I love watching women do their squats while watching a water birth on one TV, and watching the First Lady on Dr OZ on the other TV. Girl Power!",positive
"Not usually a fan of these chain clubs, but I received a pass to try it out. I took a yoga class from a woman by the name of Rasa last weekend and she blew me away with her knowledge and the high level of instruction. The facilities seemed pretty much as one would expect, but I used the yoga studio and it was very nice. It even had a nice sounding music playback system and while that may seem trivial to some I, as a professional musician, enjoy hearing music played on a decent sounding system. It is as important as the music itself. Studio good, Rasa = 5 stars",positive
"I love Yelp and use it before I try anywhere new. I am not very good about reviewing places because I am a busy mom and student. As I was catching up on a few reviews that I have been meaning to write I thought about the places around town that I absolutely LOVE. This gym is one of them. I have been a member since they opened in January 2008. I am shocked by some of the other reviewers comments. This place is SO clean, well lit, and open. I have never had to wait to use a machine, find parking right up front and the childcare is wonderful. My girls love going to the gym to play with friends and do arts and crafts. The instructors that work in the fitness room and spin room are the main reason that I go here. They are so encouraging, and inspiring that I have been able to remain committed to fitness and consider everyone I meet there a friend. Maybe I shouldn't write this review because the last thing I want is this place to turn into LVAC.",positive
Great location near my office. I visit it 2-3 times a week and location always has enough space. The stuff is always friendly and helpful. Sauna is always at the right temperature,positive
"Awesome gym, staff, and environment. Clean and organized. Best commercial fitness facility in the area. A total of 6 squat racks, 7 bench presses, numerous machines and open space concept allows for a comfortable workout even during rush hour. Tons of natural light near the massive cardio area allows for a great vibe.",positive
"I am rating the Spin class with Andrea at Interchange. She instructs the most challenging, high energy class I've experienced in awhile. Her music is on point. She is also innovative and keeps her spin class quite interesting. I look forward to this workout on Sundays.",positive
"I had some time in between work and a staff meeting, so decided to hit up a gym in my work area and make my downtime worthwhile ;) I obv checked Yelp to see which goodlife was bigger, cleaner, etc, and this was the one that I decided on. I am not a goodlife member anymore - transitioned to the community centre gym about a year ago. However, I did recall some things I missed - and didn't miss, today. The good: -Big! This location is huge! Has a ton of machines and weights. I can't imagine any one ever needing to wait for a cardio machine. -Clean! Aside from the random balled up towel in the fountain in the women's change room, this place was spotless! Very inviting! -Free - member appreciation month meant guests were free. Sweet deal and nice surprise! -Juicebar - I have never seen a goodlife with a Juicebar before. But it was helpful since I knew I wouldn't have time to grab food before heading back work. I got a mango protein shake and the woman was very accommodating. She showed me the protein powder so I could ensure it was gfree, and told me what else goes in. It was surprisingly good for a protein drink and cheap! $4 for a small (cash only btw). They also had protein bars and other drinks like Gatorade. The not so good: -Muscleheads - these guys dominated the entire free weight area. I get it, you have big muscles. But grunting, shouting and dropping weights is really unnecessary. And if you can only do one rep before dropping the weights, maybe it's a sign that they're too heavy. Also, taking 15 minute breaks in between your sets of 1 rep is inconsiderate. The free weight area was somewhat small compared to the rest and a big chunk was dedicated to free weight machines. So the benches were hard to come by and occupied by the aforementioned people. The front desk staff - Kinda rude and standoffish. Nothing more than the general greeting and that was even in a bored, dismissive way. Ah well. Regardless, the two negatives are not enough to drag down the positives. I wouldn't hesitate to go back.",positive
Large place makes finding available machines easier than Goodlife's smaller locations. I find their staff here aren't as friendly above and beyond the greeting as you walk in. Its awesome that Goodlife Fitness gyms are open 24hrs with someone at the desk 24hrs. This location is always fairly clean and the classrooms (group exercise/ cycling) are well kept.,positive
"I used to go to this gym regularly for years but moved to the city. Decided to go today because I had a bit of time and was in the area. On my way out, I decided to use the washroom first and when I made my way to the stalls, I realized that the floors had just been mopped. I was a few steps to one of the stalls when the cleaner ORDERED me to walk over ""there"". I said ""where?"", she got frustrated and said there!!! I said, ""but I need to use the washroom."" She goes, ""did I tell you not to use the washroom?! I told you to walk over there!!!!!!"" Wtf?! Never have I ever been disrespected and for what?! When I had calmed down a couple hours later, I decided to call the gym to tell the manager and make a complaint. Spoke to a woman named Kelly who proceeded to give me a bit of attitude and told me she was there when it happened and the cleaner wasn't yelling at me. Really?! What do you call that then when a cleaner ordered you and continued to yell at you when you just retaliated because you felt disrespected. And to make matters worse, she was there and yet she did absolutely nothing about it? What kind of a useless manager are you?! Needless to say, I reported the incident to head office.",negative
"The amount of humidity and mould in this place is unreal! Located at a basement underneath Hillcrest mall makes this place always hot, humid and smells like mould all year long. I stayed at this club as a member for one year, while on a contract, I had to actually sign up at another club and pay double the monthly fees, just because I couldn't handle it over there! At a gym, it's essential to have a good air ventilation/cooling system to Keep the air flowing, to assist in breathing for a successful smooth workout. This was not the case here. The size of this gym is fairly small, with a good size of the free weights area, but very few weight machines and only few cardio machines (treadmills, ellipticals, etc...) The group workout/classes room is nothing different than the above, it's maybe 700-1000 sqft max, and it gets really crowded in there, with the humid and smell of the walls, you can only imagine the situation in there..they usually have few fans on full blast, but don't really help. Same applies to the locker rooms, being small so it gets hard looking for a free locker, and cleanness is certainly an issue in that area as well. Goodlife is a great brand, and i'm a fan of one of their other locations, but this one is really at the bottom of the list in my opinion.",negative
"I am not a fan of this goodlife. First of all- basement gym. It's a no from me. There is no reception whatsoever so people hang around on the staircase or upstairs trying to grasp that tiny bit of LTE that they can. Body vision across the street is a basement gym as well but they have full reception as well as provide full free wifi - something goodlife should look into, especially when they charge so much more. Equipment here is plentiful but not sure if you'd want to use a lot of it, as nobody wipes their sweat down and half of the stuff feels grimy and unclean. The squat racks are almost always empty or barely a wait, which I approve of. There are lots of equipment for you to get your whole workout in, and lots of benches that remain untouched as well. Lots of things here are always free - squat racks, smith machines, benches, cardio machines ..it's as if everyone gathers around the dumbbell jungle or something. There's always some sort of a ..unclean smell here. Staff are nice for the most part and even more nice if they know you, from the way they treat their regulars with kind conversation to the quick hello, goodbye I get from them. Eh, hours aren't even great either. Don't really see a reason why I'd willingly come here, unless I had no choice.",negative
"Maybe two stars is a little harsh. Let's say two and a half. This gym has a number of issues that makes me wonder how it's stayed open for so long. Like most other people who grudgingly go here, I dislike the dungeon-like feel of the windowless basement. The showers always smell musty even though there is always someone cleaning them out. The spinning room is always dark for some reason. I've tried turning on the lights but someone always comes in and shuts them off. The cardio machines are old and they have super tiny TVs. The staff at the reception desk are not friendly at all. They don't make eye contact when you approach them for help. They don't greet you like at every single other Goodlife on the planet. They chat amongst themselves and with their friends who hang out there and ignore everyone else. So why do I come here? Well probably because for extended hours there's not any other options in this area. There are couple of things I like about Hillcrest. One is the women's only room which I only just discovered in the last year or two. If I want to do a quick workout, there is always a treadmill free in here and free weights all to myself. It feels like I'm working out in my basement at home but it gets the job done quick. Plus for a more serious workout, the free weight area can't be beat. Tons of benches and weights. Other than that, I'd rather drive another few minutes south on Yonge to the Thornhill Goodlife.",negative
"The experience I had with them for four years it amazing experience, had committed gym trainers and had great classes. It was my first to started for experience to know on my journey to started on a was like. It give best start but for over timed, I didn't needed a personal trainer to know what and excetcise fit for me. Than in time I didn't really need the experience on class started Beach Body work give also results too and it had helped my card while watching tv on trade. So I switched to Fit for less which give good with Hydro message, discount on drinks, it excluded but I have my own for cheaper I chosed Fit for less in the future I might come back.",positive
"This club is going downhill under new management. I've been coming to this location for close to a decade, and it's turning into a planet fitness. The only thing it is missing is a lunk alarm... The club is in the basement with very poor ventilation. The change rooms are small, stinks, and dirty most of the time. The only reason I come to this club is that it's close to my house, made friends with people here over the years, and the power/squat racks are decent. Through all my years, using chalk has never been an issue at this club but currently with the new manager there is a witch hunt on chalk. The new manager is very duplicitous on laying blame on other members complaining about ""chalk"" use. Since the power/squat racks are well away from all the other workout areas, and I see no reason for anybody who actually go near that area to complain. Like I said, I've been here for years, and never had a problem. In fact the serious trainers in the past use chalk themselves... For now out of respect I will switch over to liquid chalk (colourless liquid grip) so the manager doesn't have to police anymore, and he can spend more time on the computer surfing the internet... Serious lifters will always be here, staff come and go, when this happens people will start using chalk again. In the end, I see really no point in alienating long time members who actually put there weights away... Please concentrate on things that will improve the club. IE) clean change rooms, educating douche bag members to put their weights and towels away after use.., bolting large gym equipment to the floor so it does not get moved, and take space in the aisles. Thanks... Joe",negative
"I wish I could go back in time and activate my corporate membership elsewhere. This was the most frustrating experience I've ever had with a fitness centre. Long story short, I spent over a week waiting for my gym key to arrive. I didn't want to annoy them so I asked every couple of days for an update on the key situation. After waiting over a week, I find out they ran out the morning of! I was furious!!! This location just wasted my time and left a sour taste in my mouth. I was only able to get my key from ANOTHER location... All it took was a 2 minute explanation on how the Hillcrest location screwed me over. So for those who are planning to activate their corporate memberships, I'd recommend you go elsewhere or else you will spend a long time keyless and constantly asking them when your gunna get the damn key.",negative
"Can I give this place negative stars?!?! This place is the worst Goodlife Club (At Hillcrest Mall) I have ever been to. Incompetent employees and managers and on top of that you get no reception on your phone (Not that you really need a cell phone during your workout). So Movember and Goodlife partnered up together for Men's Health. So I created a Mo Space to join the 30 day movement. Charity and Fitness together for a good cause. Me and my friend went to this Goodlife location to start the movement. Unfortunately, this guy Jay gave us the hardest time. He was giving us a tour of the gym, talking to us about personal trainers, and membership rates. We just wanted to do the 30 day movement without being heckled. We used a guest pass about 3-5 years back at that location, and because of that technicality Jay would not let us use the gym. Talk about a son of a beach. Way to represent Goodlife and show how they feel about charities. The manager was fully supportive of Jay and everything he had to say. Worst part was Jay was a tiny scrawny dude. You think if you were trying to sell gym memberships and personal trainers, that you would at least look like you use the products/services that you are trying to sell. #HitTheWeights I hope that other locations are far from providing the poor customer service that this Goodlife club is providing. Way to show me why I didn't like Extreme Fitness or Goodlife gyms to begin with. @GoodlifeFitness JimStar Out!!!",negative
"I was very upset with the way HillCrest Mall Goodlife did not care about the wellbeing,safety and cleanliness for their customers. Lockers falling off hinges, nearly hit another customer in forehead,toilets dirty, towels all over the floor . I Reached out to management for help fix the locker so no one else gets hurt. Management said to me he couldn't look at it because his training was more important. After numerous complaints to head office they made no effort to try to keep me as a customer. My wife and son went to cancel was told they needed to cancel with a manger they made arrangement and the manager decided to not show up leaving no instructions for the staff. My wife drove down for nothing. My advise, do not join Goodlife they only hire kids to run the place and socialize. All I asked was to change gyms as a good will and head office said I would have to pay more money. Goodlife head office ended up waiving my $100 cancelation fee and said goodbye. I ended up joining another gym near by which is 100% betters than Goodlife.",negative
"If you ever wanted to go back to the past and experience what's it like to be sprayed with a firehose in the 60's race riots in America, this is the place to go! The water pressure in the showers is so strong it can knock a young child unconscious! I take freezing cold showers in the morning, do I dear try it here with so much water and in one of the coldest days in Canada? Yes I did! And it quite an experience, good? Not sure but it was different. Despite the new equipment and lots of it, it's not a good place to work out. I find that the ceiling is low because it's in the basement and everything is too tight together. But are you really thinking about working out when there's this awesome shower there?!",positive
"I like to come here on the weekends since it tends to be less busy than other Goodlife gyms. The floor space is smaller than other gyms but it does have a bar, pool and sauna. It has a lot of cardio machines and unique weight training machines. I wish it had more squat racks and flat benches. One flat bench has been ""under repair"" for several months even though it looks fine. There's also no real space to deadlift and the free weight area is kinda small. Overall I'd recommend this place during weekends but I'd probably hate to come here during busier hours.",negative
"I'm a little upset about this gym. I usually go to a different one: First of all they give passes time to time and second they have a really good customer service, staffs are amazing (East Mall, Etobicoke). But this gym here, makes the Goodlife company look really bad! I went online and saw that Goodlife charge 14$ for a trial of 14days. That's fine but when I go to the gym with my cousin (who's a guest in Toronto), they wanted to charge 15$, 2sec later another guy came and said: ""ok I'll be the nice guy and charge you 5$"". I mean that sound more like they really don't need to charge anything but they just want to make extra for some reason. It's really not the 15$ that bothers me but the principal of charging 15$ or 5$ for what exactly when other gyms gives passes away or online we can get a 14$ trial for 14days. I mean c'mon guys are you that desperate? It disgust me, first and last time I'm going there!!",negative
"One of the nicest Good Life clubs around. It is located in a former industrial building, but they did a nice job renovating the interior. This location appears to have all new equipment, and its not too crowded. at least when I was there. There is also a smoothie bar. Not sure on the pricing, but they advertised a deal where you get a card and 2 free smoothies if you buy 10. They also have a small pool and hot tub. There is also plenty of free parking. All in all, it was a great workout experience here, and I will probably frequent this location again.",positive
"I truly wish I could give a NEGATIVE REVIEW!. OMG. Now here's the deal people. This WAS....*****WAS******* A Gold's Gym!. I was considering the purchase of a membership with Gold's GYM. Its extremely close to work, it took them a year to finish it, its nice n' side, has a cardio theatre, not bad on the weights (could do with more...but its not bad)....I was quoted $66/month NO contract. Paid on-line...etc.etc. Much my shock....the Gold's GYM is now....A GOODLIFE! WTF!!!!!!.....Good Life SUCKS &^@!!!!!!!. Their downtown locations have NO flow, not enough equipment, and often are multi-leveled. I have had extremely POOR relations with Good Life. Sad to say, I will never bee back in that GOLD's /Goodlife facility again. EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED!!!!! Buyer Beware: GoodLife has LOTS and I mean LOTS of little add on nonsense things, and little clauses here and there in their contracts to keep you hooked...for life!. Min. 1 year nonsense. FAIL!",negative
"I haven't been to a gym in years, opting to spend my time playing sports. But we came here because we had 7-day passes from when this location was owned by Gold's Gym, but as of December 2012 this place is a Goodlife Fitness. A few amenities of note: - Plenty of parking outside. - A playroom for children. - A swimming pool and hot tub. - Large lockers (larger than the space that airlines give you for carry-on). - A basketball hoop. - Showers. About 40% of the open space is occupied by cardio machines (they have since removed almost an entire row of treadmills). But almost all cardio machines have built-in TVs, an iPhone/iPod dock and USB charger. I can watch TV while I run? I am sold! Apparently you can also search Google and Wikipedia, but I didn't try it out. The rest of the space is evenly split between weight machines that work on various muscles and free weights. We tried a number of the weight machines and they were all pretty good, except the leg curl (I think we're too short). One of the most interesting things that they have are machines specifically for stretching. There's one specifically for hamstring stretches that will lift your leg up and measure the angle. There's another one for hip flexors, etc. The location didn't seem busy during the last week in December when we used our passes, but was fairly busy on our last day (Jan 2nd). The equipment and locker rooms were pretty clean. There are classes that you can attend, like yoga or bootcamp, but we didn't attend any. There is no open wifi connection, so no Yelp check-ins on an iPod touch. We did not end up buying a membership.",negative
"I wish every gym I dropped into while travelling was this good. Very well-equipped with:3 squat racks, 4 benches, a long dumbbell rack, at least one of every weight machine a normal human would need (glute-ham included) and a mobility section with bands, balls and rollers. Lots of cardio stuff too and a room for group classes which I didn't use. Everything was in good shape and clean. Large, locker and shower room with an ironing board & iron in the men's. And not at all crowded on Saturday afternoon.",positive
"This is one of my favourite Goodlife locations within downtown Toronto. It has a chill environment, the staff is extremely friendly, and the club is totally clean no matter what time you go. It's a very chill location and is located in the basement of the building. While smaller, it has a much chiller vibe and resembles a boutique gym. The changerooms are top notch; almost luxurious sort of and are gigantic in size. This gym has never been crowded while I've been here so you basically have the gym to yourself. Everything is maintained well, they have bumper plates and 3 squat racks and a big area to stretch yourself out. The free weight section could be bigger but the vibe and atmosphere of this location is what sets it apart from the rest in downtown Toronto.",positive
"The gym is pretty small but definitely has the nicest trainers of the multiple locations I've been to in Toronto. This is my preferred weekday location as I rarely have to wait for racks, benches, etc. However, there is no good location to deadlifts -- you always feel like you're in somebody's way.",positive
"This GoodLife location is conveniently located next to the Eaton Centre, but since the gym is located in the basement of Bell Trinity Centre, it does not appeal to me at all due to lack of windows. The gym consists of a fairly decent size main gym area, group fitness room, stretching area and weights area with a good amount of equipment and machines. The staff are always friendly and smiling. I definitely felt welcomed upon my first visit and not knowing where everything was located, I was given clear instructions. I can only comment on Sunday mornings as that is the only time I come to this location for their Pilates class. I was delighted when the Pilates instructor was the same person as the one who taught at the GoodLife in the Eaton Centre many years ago. Azadeh, is absolutely amazing as each of her Pilates classes are different, always challenging and you leave the class feeling taller and stronger each time. Plus she teaches proper breathing techniques, corrects postures and provides modifications and advanced variations if needed. Not all instructors are as attentive. The changing room is probably one of the nicer GoodlLife has to offer and reminds me a little of the spa atmosphere. Shower facilities consists of individual wooden panelled stalls with rain shower like spray. Since Sunday mornings were rarely busy, I often felt like I had the whole changing room to myself. I definitely recommend the Sunday morning Pilates class at 10am with Azadeh. You won't be disappointed and I guarantee you'll feel taller and stronger by the end of the class. Go give it a try!",negative
"This is the Goodlife location I go to most often. Like all locations, the staff really push to sell you personal training sessions when you first sign up, so be aware of that if you want to join. The gym itself is always clean, locker rooms well maintained. There is the occasional machine that is out of service but that's to be expected. There are a ton of cardio machines (almost too many) and a decent amount of weight machines. The weight machines can get very busy during peak hours so if you prefer using them over free weights I'd suggest going during off times, otherwise you'll probably have to wait. I've tried some of the yoga classes and thought they were great.",positive
"I joined Goodlife to shave off the 70lbs I gained from a year of inactivity. I made the mistake of going to the 4:30pm BodyPump at 80 Bloor Yorkville. I've done Body Pump before and put great effort on my form despite being out of shape. The class instructor rudely comments about my rhythm during biceps curls even though I was doing excellent form and rhythm. The thing that really bothered me was later when she screamed (angrily) at me in front of class ""slow down FAT GUY"" during the push-ups. This is a very insensitive comment and not very helpful. I don't need a fitness instructor telling me that I'm FAT. I try to follow the routine so I wasn't off by much. I know my form was correct so she couldn't fault me for that so she criticizes my rhythm and insults me to boot. It's traveling pushups -not easy. In fact I could see many people around me with bad form/ rhythm and she targets me. It's like she was purposely mad and discouraging me during the class which she has succeed as I have no intention of attending any class taught by her again -ever.",negative
"This is my home gym...I've been a gym rat for many years and have tried so many gyms, it isn't funny. Every gym has its own girks and not so good things about it.

"This is my home gym (Eaton Centre North). I'm a true gym rat and also born in the Chinese Year of the Rat which makes me either 26, 28, 50, 62, 74... i'm not 14 or 86 :D I was also a former Bally member (like the reviewer Sunny V) before they got taken out by GoodLife and Extreme. The best part is my membership got grandfathered when GoodLife took over so I've got a very good rate. From a corporate perspective, they are a 5 star organization in this aspect of club managing. I have no issues with their policies and how they treat their members. Most of my fellow work out friends are at Extreme which is both good and bad. Bad is I do miss hanging with them at the gym and my jaw muscles are much weaker but good is I actually get a work out and I'm out much faster. From a social perspective, this is more of a corporate club as members are courteous but not chummy. You'll always get a few oddballs (ie. smelly, dirty or strange like the tranny who likes to wear his thongs to do a strip dance routine but he's recently moved elsewhere) so if these are your thing you may have your senses aroused. Overall a good mix and plenty of eye candy if that is your thing too (both guys and gals). 4 stars here. Equipment and facilities is definitely 3 stars and dropping. The club is about 10 years old so it badly needs a face lift. The size is about 18,000 sq. ft and the free weights area is a tad small. The aerobics room is a decent size and the rubber flooring was installed over the old wood floors when GoodLife took over a few years ago. Unfortunately that was the extent of the reno and here I give the management only 3 stars. The spinning room has an old bouncing floor (not sure if that is good or bad for you) and the yoga studio is a bit cramped. They brought in a few machines when they took over but everything is rather dated. Lockers are on the small side and they do have a steam room and showers (I don't use them since I live nearby). I've been to some of their older clubs and if GoodLife has a fault, it is they do not seem to bother updating their older clubs. I've been to several of their other gyms (Yonge-St. Clair, Manulife Centre, Bloor Park, Liberty Village, Coxwell-Gerrard, 2 Queen or also known as Eaton Centre South). Liberty Village is a beauty but too far for me. The trainers here are OK but a few are not as professional and lack friendliness or turnover is rather high but that's typical of all health clubs. I'll assume the compensation is the likely the issue here. Overall, I would give this gym a rating of 3.5-4 stars but dropping due to it's age. Rumour has it they are building a new flagship location nearby... to be confirmed in 2011.",positive
This use to the Old Bally's Corporate gym. Since Bally went belly up. Goodlife bought most of its gym. The Gym is located on the 5th floor. I wouldn't say the gym is super clean. It has some funky smell around. Especially when you walk it. You get use to it after few minutes. :-) Personally I just go in and do my work out and leave. I never do cardio and joint one of those class. The spinning class looks fun. But I think I will die if I go to one of them. lol I am skinny enough I don't need spinning class. I got the chop stick figure who needs to do cardio or any classes. :-) That being said. They do have different classes. I wouldn't join the spinning class not you get a lot of chubby people in there. The freaking room stink. Yikes. This gym use to be the best for bird watching. I guess since they open one on King West all the good looking birds are gone only the ducks are left in this gym. Cheers.,negative
I really like the steam room here :) This is a medium sized location. I like going here sometimes. Again I've found a couple of the class instructors not up to form.,positive
I've been training here for just under 3 years and I love it! The women's program is fantastic allowing women of all levels to improve while feeling safe. I also love that classes are frequent and you are well informed of any changes so I can work them into a busy schedule and balance the rest of my life!,positive

"My son wanted to try jujitsu and this location was highly recommended. I have family in law-enforcement and was told this place is the best both for technique, encouragement and character building. I absolutely loved our time here! From the helpful front desk staff to the instructors to Gustavo himself, everyone is warm and welcoming. This group is interested in teaching excellent technique as well as reinforcing stellar personal character. Their approach to student development keeps them winning local and national events. I was a bit concerned it was going to be a group that stressed winning above everything else. The instructors make sure that each student knows the basic techniques really well before adding on to additional training. They are very interested in continuing to build a solid foundation as well as building a foundation of a good work ethic and integrity. I can't say enough good things about this group.",positive
Excellent place to learn BJJ. The instructors are all very good. Everyone I have met here is friendly and the atmosphere is like a family. Great place!!,positive
"Was in town for the evening and needed a place to train. It was a Friday, which isn't a great day for training where I'm from. But here, not only was there a several hour open mat, it was chockablock with purple, brown and black belts. There was probably 25 people there and everyone was safe, skilled and polite. The facility was also great. There were two separate training floors, both quite large. There were also full locker rooms, showers and separate bathrooms. The staff was polite and helpful. I can see why hundreds of people train here on a regular basis. It's a great gym. FYI, the mat fee was $25 for a single day. I found it to be worth the cost. If you're in the area, I highly recommend you check it out.",positive
Great place for kids and adults to train. Very friendly and knowledgeable coaches. If you are looking for recreational or competition Jiu jitsu they have a class for everyone.,positive
"After visiting a few Brazilian jiu-jitsu in the east valley I had decided to call GD Jiu-Jitsu Academy. To my amazement someone not only answered the phone immediately, but was extremely friendly and willing to answer my questions I had about possibly enrolling my two boys(6/10) I came down and took a quick tour and was very impressed with the size and cleanliness of this facility. I decided to bring my boys down for a free trial to see if this was something they would enjoy. During the kids class I was very impressed with the Coaching Staff and the way the other more experienced kids interacted with the new students. After the class had ended, my oldest son ran up to me in the lobby really excited explaining how much he love and felt like this is where he belongs. Needless to say we signed up. 6mons later we have seen a huge impact with school grades improving from C's/D's to A's all the way across the board, self confidence is through the roof, core strength is building quickly, mentally developing a thought process of logical and intuitive thinking for problem solving(physically and scholastically.) I have nothing but love and good things to say about this Academy, staff, students, and families.",positive
"Early Bird Classes Monday through Friday. I dont think there is another gym in the area that offers that. Also, world class instructions and cohesive curriculum for all levels.",positive
I am a kid and I love this gym its a very friendly inviorment and the coaches help me through a lot they take it slow and make sure you get it all even if we have fun we also know when to be serious there always trying there best to help you learn it also helps with self defence and disoplyn and working with others,positive
"Super inviting and helpful staff. The general manager is A plus at his job and it's more than a gym, but a lovely community. Highly recommend!",positive
Excellent academy! I had a very positive experience here as I'm from out of town. The owner Gustavo Dantas is a class act and works very hard to run an amazing facility to train at. The best school in the area in my honest opinion. The environment is great for those wanting to get in shape and learn something new as they offer fundamental classes taught by expert instructors.From what I've seen they have a thriving kids and womens program. They also have advanced classes and competition training for those taking the sport seriously and are looking high level training. Great people here and very professionally run school.,positive
"There is no better teacher of jiu jitsu than Gustavo. He hammers the basics til they are second nature and give you a solid base of essentials while others will try to teach you super advanced moves that rarely happen. Gustavo is the best, you can't go wrong with him",positive
Professor Dantes was more then welcoming and super friendly as were his students. Plenty of high level training partners and the facility was clean. Highly recommended!,positive
Hands down the best Jiu Jitsu in the state of Arizona. Gustavo is a true professional who is alway perfecting his craft. I highly recomend GD jiu jitsu academy,positive
The best Jiu jitsu school that cater for all ages. They have a very good kids program and they have the #1 competition team in Arizona.,positive
So happy we found this place! Coach Kelly and Avery are fantastic with my daughter! She loves going here and is learning so much. We've tried other gyms but prefer this one because it's a more family oriented place.,positive
Found this place through Groupon. Coach Kelly is amazing with the girls! He makes it funny and enjoyable for them to learn gymnastics. I will definitely enrolling my daughter after my Groupon is finished.,positive
"We love gym and fit because it is a fun learning environment. My daughter who is not yet two is always ready to learn something new. She is tumbling, doing the beginnings of flips, learning to balance, hanging on bars, and so much more. She loves it, and I love it!",positive
This is easily the best gym for our 8 year old daughter. We have been going to this gym for a year now and my daughter has come so far. Kelly really has helped her such a great deal and she loves her coach! The prices are also excellent and so worth it! I most definitely put my trust in Coach :),positive
"We like Gym and Fit because it teaches Gage to be patient, to follow directions and to be a good listener. I am so glad we found Gym and Fit. Mr. Kelly is an amazing coach.",positive
Great place to get your kids started in gymnastics. Coach Kelly is THE best coach you could ever ask for! He taught my oldest child years ago who has gone on to be an amazing athlete! He inspires greatness in all the kids he teaches and I'm so excited that he is now teaching my 4 year old. Hands down best place for kids gymnastics!,positive
"located in a commercial complex. Operates as a gym and the other half, is basically a private men's club for Gay/Bisexual men. Rooms, steam room etc... Average to Good looking men . Toured the place with friends. Interesting but not my scene. I always say, whatever floats your boat. Pleasant patrons and staff. Clean and well maintained.",negative
"Was there again last night. Was outstanding !!!!!!!!!! Can't believe how many guys are there and all want to have fun. Great staff, wonderful movies and plenty of action. It was getting even more crowded as I was leaving @ 11 or so. Even exchanged numbers with 3 guys. Highly recommend if you want to have a great time",positive
"I went at an odd hour so there wasn't a lot of people there but the guys I did meet, including the staff were very nice and welcome. Could use some updates in a few areas but they keep the place clean. I would go back, at a better hour. Lol.",positive
"I tried a lot of gay bath house in Los Angeles, San Diego, Paris.. and trust me I'm always honest, this is the worst place I've been! Almost everything is used and dirty, I'll won't juge about the customers, just saying very slow and only old people.. BUT the worst part was the staff! Actually on a Thursday night there was only one employee.. he was so rude!! No smile, no welcoming! I had a something to do so I had to leave, I asked him to give me back my ID (yes they keep your ID since you're in until you leave .. why??) and the guy respond to me I'm busy! He was speaking with another customer! I got back my ID after 10 minutes and he almost throw it on the floor!! Never come back there!! I know there is a sauna very close to this one!",negative
This was my first time visit here. After visiting other bath houses around the country this is a good go for Las Vegas. The crowd is older but nice. They have lockers and private rooms. They have several public play areas setup for different scenes. The staff is very helpful and friendly.,positive
"Since the Blue Moon closing three years ago its been hard to find a good men's only place. I think I found it here. I've been to entourage across the parking lot from this place and its not as much fun. How can I describe it. The steam room here is kicking on all cylinders and is awesome to sweat it out. The showers are across the hall from the steam room so perfectly placed. The gym is great because there's almost nobody in there. Its fun. Add in the clothing optional factor and I'm a fan. Ideally for gay men, or some straight men if you don't suffer from fragility of your masculinity.",positive
I didn't see much of the place but I went when they had a BBRTS party and met the hottest guy there. After about 15 mins we were back in the privacy of my room. Good place to meet guys.,positive
This is a grittier version of entourage which is on the other side of the parking lot. It's always kept clean but the playroom is hot and so it the darkroom. Yes this is a gay bathhouse so you'll see some adult body parts and men on men action.,positive
"hawks gym is a ""MENS CLUB"" . The other reviewer is either nieve or not understanding of what that means. The gym part is secondary to what it is. If he had wanted to use a real gym, Las vegas athlethic club is right beside it. ths 30 a month. enjoy. This is a bath house. nothing more nothing less. the Men are more mature ussually. much better than the other place in town.",positive
"Before going to Hawk's Gym, I knew that it was both a gym and a private club to hook up in. I'm gay, and I wanted to check it out, not because I wanted to hook up (that's not my thing), but because I wanted to try the gym and be able to look at the other hot guys while working out. When I first stepped in, I could tell it was like a seedy night club because of the ambiance (and I was there in the middle of the day). I was in line behind two old perverts and in front of an impatient effeminate twink. The scummy old porker behind the counter looked like he'd worn the same clothes for at least a few days and hadn't showered in a week, and he was one of the rudest people I've ever encountered. He was clearly annoyed when I asked him a few questions about the gym, like I was interrupting him from his sitting on his lazy fat ass. After letting the two older men in, the pig behind the counter asked if I wanted a locker or room. I told him I was new to Vegas and was curious about the gym. The annoying guy behind me sighed impatiently. The guy behind the counter rudely told me that there are no tours of the gym because it was against policy. I asked him about the membership. He said that membership was $15 for 3 months. I thought it was a great deal! I told him I was interested in a membership. I mean, who can beat that price, right? Unfortunately, to get into Hawk's Gym, you have to purchase either a locker (for $10) or a private dressing room (for $25). If you're a member, you STILL have to pay for either a locker or room! I asked the guy if I could not purchase a locker or room and just come in my gym clothes and work out, and he said I couldn't because it's against policy! So to work out here (let's say 20 times a month), it's going to cost you at least $200 a month. That's absurd! But this is also a place to hookup. So technically, you're paying for sex (illegal!). I was pissed because I just wanted to join a gym to work out and look at the other hot guys.",negative
"My first time rock climbing in years was awesome! We bought a Groupon for 2 including all day passes and harness rental for $30 the night before and headed in on Friday morning. We had the place to ourselves and after a quick video and instruction on how to belay we were off on our own. The facility is clean and spacious and was being vacuumed the entire time we were there since some climbers use chalk. There were plenty of walls with different levels of difficulty to try. They have partner climb, individual climb and also bouldering areas. It's definitely a work out but enjoyable for any level of fitness. Let's just say I've been sore for several days and I'm not seeing and end yet!",positive
"Came with a friend because they had a great Groupon deal. We had so much fun here! I will definitely be coming back again with other family members and friends. My only complaint is that I wish there were more auto belays, but other than that it was a great time! Also the staff was very friendly and helpful!",positive
"This place is awesome!!! Brought my kids by way of Groupon and the folks there were super helpful and patient with us first timers! First we watched a video and then demonstrated that we were familiar with the ""belay"" process and then we were set free to climb! The difficulties were varied and we tried everything without injury! We are definitely going back!!",positive
"I bought a groupon here for a full day of climbing for 2 for $22.00. It was well worth it and a great way to try new exercises. They have guides that give you an orientation tutorial, and teach you how to be the climber and partner with the rope, although for the most part they were pretty hands off - I guess you could ask them for help if you needed it or if there was an emergency they would be there. The staff were all very nice - the equipment worked well, and we used our own tennis shoes which were fine for climbing. I like how they have the ""difficulty"" level marked on each course with numbers so you can gauge what to try next. I would definitely consider a membership and coming back here. Rock climbing is so much fun!",positive
"It was our first time here and we will be back for sure! The staff is excellent. Very friendly and knowledgeable. The facility is very clean and well maintained. While we are very.much beginners, it appeared there were varying levels for all expertise. A very fun afternoon!",positive
"This was my first time rock climbing and I had a really positive experience. We had a groupon deal and it was definitely worth it. When you walk in you get greeted and they ask if you have done rock climbing before. You then sign a few papers and watch a video. Someone watches you to make sure you put on the equipment correctly. Once you are done with all that, you are free to roam! They had a lot of different styles/levels. It was fun to try all of them. We didn't have to wait for anything to climb since the place is so large. There is also drinks and snacks if you want to purchase anything. We were there for about 2.5 hours and it was so fun and worth it! We would definitely go back again!",positive
"Fun for all ages! Went here today (using their Groupon) for the first time and had a blast. Took about 20 minutes to watch a safety video, learn the harnesses, etc. and then you were free to climb as you please. I highly recommend going in pairs or else you will have limited options of ropes or need to have a stranger that you can pair up with. However, I saw two auto hookups where you could just climb on your own. Climbs are labeled by difficulty so you have a heads up what you're getting yourself into. Got there around 3 on a Saturday and it was pretty crowded. Most ropes were in use. However by 4pm there weren't many people there. I would recommend going early or later on in the day. Will definitely be back.",positive
"Both locations are fantastic facilities with friendly and helpful staff that facilitate a truly welcoming environment for climbers of all skill levels. Routes and problems are great, well-maintained, and change regularly. The South End location is impressive, to say the least, with much higher walls, expansive bouldering, and great sport opportunities, including several auto belays (especially useful if you are not yet qualified to belay on routes that are not pre-rigged). South End is geared more towards climbers with some previous experience (regardless of age), which is a much needed and welcome addition for those who take climbing a bit more seriously. There are still plenty of opportunities with bouldering and auto belays if you are a beginner. Climbing is an awesome way to get kids active and excited about the outdoors but if your children are inexperienced and not into climbing as a sport, you will probably be better served by visiting the Monroe Road location. This location is better geared towards those brand new to the sport, as they have several beginner-level top rope routes pre-rigged with gri-gris that you are qualified to use after a 15-minute lesson your very first day. Regardless of the facility, you will want to keep an eye on kids, as the facilities are not heavily staffed and the actions of some rambunctious youngsters can end in injury for them and others. I have seen many times where parents allow their kids to run through the gym without caution, climb without ropes on areas that are not for bouldering, walk/run underneath climbers, and climb up on down climb only areas. These are all huge things parents need to ensure do not happen to contribute to a safe environment for everyone. But not to worry, readers, for as many wild kids I have seen, I have seen triple the amount of kids who have been taught their gym etiquette and safety, are spending awesome quality time with their family, and other kids who completely and utterly crush better than myself and a ton of adults. The community of climbers at Inner Peaks is extremely friendly, welcoming, and ready at will to help you - whether it be belaying for a solo climber or sharing knowledge about gear and climbing spots. At the end of the day, I cannot recommend Inner Peaks enough.",positive
"I went to Inner Peaks with three others for some afternoon fun. It was a Friday and we were 4 of about 9 people in the place. After signing some waivers, we watched a short introductory video and got to climbing under the supervision of one of the employees. Once we'd all practiced a few times, we were on our own. The last time I climbed was about 15 years ago and took a while for me to get the courage up to climb higher than 4 feet off the ground. I wish we'd had more time, because just as I found my groove we had to leave. There was a good variety of climbing options for novice and expert climbers. Definitely give yourself time to get acclimated if it's been a while. A fun way to spend time indoors for kids or adults!",positive
"I came here with a friend to use a giftcard that she gave me few months ago back in March. We could not use the giftcard, because they could not find a recent transaction on that giftcard. My friend immediately checked her bank account and saw that they charged her for that giftcard back in March. My friend did everything she possibly can to grab a hold of someone who can help her settle this matter. However, their employees and even the manager couldn't be efficient about this. Even the manager couldn't be any sincere about what had happened. One of the employee mentioned how this happens oftenly. This is something you should not be proud of or even mention to your customers. I wonder how many disappointed customers who purchased a giftcard walked out of their doors. You've got to be extra extra careful when purchasing a giftcard here. Much attention needed since they will charge you for the giftcard but not even put money in there. We are both upset and VERY disappointed that we both had to go through this. My positive view on this place has changed, especially the way they handled this matter was not professional at all.",negative
"Very Disappointed! Have been going to inner peaks for many years and have brought many customers to the place. I bought a giftcard for a birthday and recently when she went to go use it, they said there was no purchase history on it. I bought it in march and thankfully had purchased it with a card otherwise they would not have been able to find it and credit the visit to the giftcard. This is most definitely an employee error and I wanted some sort of voucher for my friend since this was unacceptable. The manager was very apathetic and did not care that my friend had gone there just to use the giftcard and had to pay with her own money to buy the pass. From the view of the person who bought the giftcard for a birthday, I was very disappointed and embarrassed that she could not use it. What also flabbergasted me was that the employees there said this happened often... Am I overreacting or should this definitely should not happen again. So for now Do Not buy giftcards until they train their employees to do their jobs correctly.",negative
"I've never been climbing before, but I went to the Yelp Quirks Out event earlier this week and LOVED it - the instructors were super helpful and made learning how to use the ropes and belay your partner easy. I also really liked the social atmosphere - every climber I encountered was friendly and willing to give out tips. There were lots of climbers, so occasionally we had to wait for one of the easier routes to open up, but in general the facility was spacious and had a ton of options. Now I just need to convince all my friends to come climbing with me!",positive
"First time rock climbing, looks easy but its definitely not, it's a great upper body work out. Bouldering was so difficult definitely got to be in great upper body shape. I had a blast and the place was pretty cool nice staff.",positive
"I've only been to climbing gyms in the DC metro area, and man, is this place different! In kind of a nice way. + Compared to any night in any DC metro area gym, this place almost feels DESERTED there are that many routes open. Not crowded at all, spacious. + They use a few gri-gris and have 2 auto-belays. Unheard of at gyms I've gone to! I think this is great for folks that are new to climbing. And it also means there seems to be more routes for folks with ATC's! + At least 2 routes with cracks. + The walls themselves are thoughtfully constructed, i.e. the edges have grooves that can act as holds, which makes it fun and more of a simulation of an outdoor experience. Love it. ~ Long orientation for first-timers, but I like that it shows that they're really concerned about safety. However, annoying for experienced climbers that don't want to spend 30 minutes getting situated. - One of the 5.6 and 5.9 routes were definitely switched. It was the first route I tried (the ""5.6"") so I was like, geez, NC routes are HARD! and then I tried the route next door (the ""5.9"") and it was clear the signage had been flipped. - Priceypricey. $16 for a day pass. Well, you're paying for those awesome routes and walls, I guess. I wish there was a student discount or pass package or something, since Charlotte's a student town.",positive
"Inner Peaks is THE place to climb in Charlotte. The staff is excellent and is the climbing community! They are always trying to make the facility better for new and seasoned climbers alike! Never been climbing before? Don't fret! The staff at Inner Peaks will take good care of you. There is a short orientation video, tour, and training to make you feel comfortable. The have rental gear to make sure you have everything you need. Just wear comfy/athletic clothes. Seasoned climber? There are 2 top-out boulders, bouldering walls, lead cave, and plenty of top ropes to suit your needs. There is also a workout area and climbing training area. Pro tips: Mondays are 1/2 price day passes for guests climbing with a member. Wednesdays are college days. Discounted day pass and gear rental with a college ID. There is also a great Power Flow yoga class offered on Wednesdays (included with the price of admission). Second location coming to the SouthEnd in 2015!",positive
"I've been going to Inner Peaks off and on for seven years or so. What impresses me is that every few years they renovate, expand, freshen up or add something new. No, that's not a list of all the same thing- they have done each individually over the years. The indoor climbing area includes: 1. Beginner Walls 2. Bouldering and lead cave 3. Free-standing boulder 4. More advanced routes (lead included) 5. Moon board 6. Slackline and training area 7. Upstairs cardio/weights (full dumbbell set, treadmill, bikes, kettles, etc) 8. Yoga studio with classes at 6:30pm 2x a week 9. Stuff for the kiddos- birthday parties and climbing team I guess now I need a number ten...monthly memberships includes yoga + climbing but this is a great place to learn about climbing on a rainy day or take a second or third date. If you have a buddy that's a member- Monday is where it is at- you'll get in for half price with them. This is a solid gym for NC - the walls aren't the tallest but they are constantly improving and striving to make climbing accessible for those looking for a fun thing to try and for those training for their next outdoor send.",positive
"Great gym. Love the space and the walls. They have slack line also. Many different routes for beginners to advanced climbers. On weekends it's usually not so busy. Atleast that has been my experience in the 5 to 6 visits in the few months. They have few auto belay routes with one or 2, 5.10 routes. So it's good to climb as a solo on some harder routes without a belayer as there is auto belay. The bouldering section is huge with plenty of overhang routes. Everything is good except one thing. The bulletin board to find climbing buddies or belayers, is not very effective. There are rarely any advertisements by other climbers for buddies. Looks like people come here after they get hooked. It's difficult get a call or request through the bulletin board for climbing buddies. So you better have someone to go with or ask around the gym to catch you. I usually go solo, and ask around. Haven't had much luck finding regular climbing partners through the advertisement on the bulletin board. That's why I am giving this gym 4 stars rating. Else everything is cool. One more thing: Staff is very friendly and have happy faces. Climb On!",positive
"It has been years since I've been to Inner Peaks, so I thought now that I have a two year old I would experiment and see if he liked to climb too. We walked in and the manager was super helpful and thought it was a great idea to see if our little man liked to climb. He even said to not worry about the day pass because who knows if our little guy would even like it. I was shocked because that never happens at businesses! Now thats customer service! So he got our 2yr old all suited up in a full harness and off we went to try a wall. Well sadly my boy wasn't feeling it and the manager told us to keep trying and he would check on us in a bit. After trying a couple different routes, we tried just letting him hang on some low jugs and that's when he started to have fun. For some reason he didn't like being attached to the rope. But after a few minutes he was done. So we came to the front and I thanked the manager again for his help and allowing us to try it out first. We will definitely be back and the climbing wall in our son's room will be the next project!",positive
Inner Peaks is an excellent place for indoor climbing and for training for serious outdoor climbing. There is a knowledgeable staff as well as equipment for rental. Only negative is that it gets a little boring after a couple of hours unless you are absolutely serious about climbing.,positive
"Love this place. I'm nowhere near being a pro or even an enthusiast of rock climbing, but Inner Peaks makes it amazing. Every time I've had the pleasure of visiting, the staff has been funny and super friendly. Willing to show you around the facility and introduce you to all that they offer. One of my favorite things at Inner Peaks is the different walls. Some of the walls are only meant for bouldering and others are for top-rope climbing. Great to split up the areas as it can get super busy and super fast. My ABSOLUTE favorite thing about the gym is the slackline. I've been a slackliner for several years and love that there is always one set up (unless there is a class going on in that area) and super easy to use. If you're a regular climber and are looking for the killer workout a couple times a week, you'll look far past the coin it will cost you to join and maintain a membership. Go with another member first. If its your absolute first time and you go with a member, it's absolutely FREE! So rad. If you go in on Mondays, its half price admission. Definitely the premier climbing gym in all of Charlotte. Love it. Maybe one day I'll get a full-fledged membership!",positive
I can't say enough good things about this climbing gym and yoga studio. Really big and well laid-out space. The staff is excellent and very helpful to those of us that are in the learning phase. It is great place for children's parties too. My son and his friends had a GREAT time.,positive
"This climbing gym is excellent. A wide array of bouldering and top-roping problems, some lead climbing areas and friendly staff. Their bouldering problems are rated a little higher than they actually are (there are a couple V5s that are more like V2+s...) but I'm generally happy with everything they have. For a whopping $55/month you can have unlimited climbing. Generally everyone in the gym is nice; there are some shirtless, washboard-ab boys who can send V6s and higher that will give you weird looks and ignore you, but aside from that you should find everyone is friendly and willing to give you some beta if you ask (or some times if you don't).",positive
"Ive been a member of IP for almost two years (even considering it a second home). I put a hold on my membership for the holidays and decided with Grad school that I couldnt afford the membership and really didnt have the time for it. I wrote an email using their contact us form and never heard anything back. Next thing I know almost two months later they are hitting me with a $172 charge! They did offer to reimburse one month and give me 5 days free initially. I don't think it's considered ""free"" if I technically already paid for it. The woman who I dealt with said she didnt receieve emails and that I needed to fill out a special form. I am not sure why I was never contacted when I suddenly appeared to not be paying my membership despite the fact that I had always done so in the past- I never climbed once during this period obviously since I had thought everything was taken care of. The woman was unwilling to work with me at all. I did not want to pay for Jan (considering its the 7th) - the month literally just started at least cut me some slack there. The customer service is obviously lacking since I have brought them tons of business in the past ( signed up several friends and my cousin is on team now). They did finally agree to take away Dec/Jan fee's but I am still paying about $70 just because they apparently never received my email. Oh and I was also told not to return because I ""hung up."" How is that for friendly service?! It was one of the most frustrating calls Ive made in a long time. I know they have let ex-employees who were fired due to drug related activities continue to climb so I have to feel a bit offended that I am banned. I will be going to The White Water Center or outdoors for all my climbing kicks. Be careful if you sign up for a membership- and send emails via your own account so you have copies- I learned a huge lesson here.",negative
"Came here on College Night and daypass + shoe rental = $16. Not bad. The venue is very large with tons of climbing space. Lots of different routes and great courses of bouldering. There was a good crowd with people of varying experience levels, which made it more comfortable for the less experienced, i.e. me. The place is rather difficult to find at first. It's through a parking lot behind some buildings. I'll definitely be back once I build up some upper body strength...",positive
Nice place and the staff is very willing to help. You have to watch a safety video first to get the hang of it but the safety harness stuff is pretty simple...it is climbing the rocks that is hard. I took my daughter there and for the climbing and equipment it cost about $25. She loved it. The location is kinda tough to find it is in the back of an industrial park so you have to watch the signs and go slowly. I've seen birthday parties there so it looks like the take care of kids pretty good also.,positive
"A very coo place, with plenty of indoor rock climbing walls. I first went there with my brother Matt. He dragged me there, because he'd been there before and said it was pretty awesome, me, well I was a little scared of heights. But not anymore, thanks to InnerPeaks (Just kidding I'm still scared of heights, but that's what makes life exciting, right?) To get started I had to rent the climbing equipment, including shoes, harness, belays, etc, I think it came to a total of around $25. then it was go time. I was a little nervous and I guess the guy at the desk could smell fresh meat, cause he asked me if it was my first time, and I cannot tell a lie, so I told him it was. Then they took me to a nook of the main floor, which is like a gymnastics floor covered in huge rock climbing walls. It smells of chalk and the floors are soft and covered in carpet. I was walked to a corner of the room, near the lockers and watched a video about the proper climbing and belaying procedures, always be in communication with your belay partner...""Climb On""! Then it was off to the walls...Inner Peaks has a ton of different walls for varying skill levels. I started with the beginner walls which have a slight slope and aren't completely vertical like some of the intermediate walls. After summitting the first wall I was exhilarated,overcoming my fear of heights and using my brain and muscles to find my way to the top. So I moved onto the bigger walls toward the front of the place. It had more difficult grips, spaced in a more challenging way, after some effort I made it to the top of this wall, as well. Rock climbing is an awesome sport, great exercise, challenging both mentally and physically and it helps you use all of your muscles, especially your legs,fingers and forearms. But that could also be because I'm not using the proper technique. Either way InnerPeaks is awesome, not only do they have some hard core walls that wrap around the entire interior of the building, but they also have little stations where you can work on your grips, techniques and strength training. And there is a whole section devoted solely to bouldering, like rock climbing, but closer to the ground and without the need for a lot of the equipment. that means its a lot cheaper to just boulder. But that also takes away the thrill of climbing 30+ feet in the air supporting yourself on nothing but tiny plastic grips and your own determination. So for me it was worth it to pay the $25, get a nice work-out and feel the thrill of being alive and pushing boundaries. InnerPeaks is a great place, check it out, its also the only indoor climbing facility in Charlotte. They offer classes and programs for all skill levels. Rock climbing is a great activity to engage in with your friends and family,(perfect place to take the kids) what better way to build camaraderie than by pushing the limits and living on the edge (all in a safe and controlled environment).",positive
The best exercise place I've been to. Is actually quite fun too. You get such a great workout. The staff is so nice and welcoming and really helps you. Is your own pace which is really nice. Love it and I will never stop coming here.,positive
"I started looking into Jabz when I saw them on Groupon. I tried one location and liked the concept, the workout went by so much faster than I though which I liked...but it just wasn't feeling like a good fit there. Then I found the North Phoenix (Shae and 32nd) location and it was everything I wanted it to be!!! I am newly into working out, New Years resolution, and really was looking for something I could get hooked on. I wanted to find something I would stick with longer than a week and a place where I was challenged but which also wasn't intimidating to the point of feeling embarrassed and wanting to quit. The trainers at this location are perfect!!!! They are always ready to help you if you forgot the exercise at a location, will modify stations to make it easier or more challenging, and they are always kind and encouraging!!! They are my favorite part and I'm so glad I found this location!!! The other girls that go are also super helpful and positive...an even better bonus!",positive
"I started Jabz before the holiday season with a groupon and became hooked! I signed up for a three month membership, and have not been disappointed so far. I love the set up, you don't feel overwhelmed and I personally feel comfortable which was a problem for me with other group fitness classes. The coaches are very encouraging and help you out when you're not doing a station correctly. Everyone is really nice. I leave there feeling accomplished and definitely out of breath!",positive
Sam is the most welcoming and energetic instructor I have ever had !!!!! The atmosphere is awesome and the workouts make you SWEAT!!!! I love how everything was explained and you never feel like you're lost and confused. I highly recommend this studio for ladies who want to stay fit or who are just starting on their journey. The all Womans atmosphere is helpful and great.... everyone seemed inspired by each other. I can't wait to come workout here again!!!!!,positive
Tried a coupon membership for 30 days at this club. Loved the space. The trainers are great. Sam really works you hard. Interval training can be confusing at the beginning but there was always someone will to help. Keep trying. I went twice a week and used all my muscle groups. It was a good tired. Loved punching the mitts with the trainers because they changed up my punching rythm and challenged me.,positive
"I have been going for a few months now and am super excited to say I am down about 20lbs. All of the trainers are great and really care about you. Sam the owner is wonderful! They have great deals on facebook and Groupon for your first month! They class sizes max out at 16 so there is a lot of personal care and attention. Classes are an hour and based around stations so the hour goes super quick. If you have been looking for a place that's fun and hard all at the same time look no further. My favorite thing about it is the care and attention of the trainers though! I broke my leg a few years ago and have to modify some of the moves. The trainers are always showing alternative ways to do the exercises and they CARE! Julia, Katrina, Gina, Rachel no matter who's training I know It's gonna be a fun time and definitely worth it in the end!",positive
"Jabz is AMAZING!!! Sam and the other trainers are so fabulous and keep you motivated throughout the tough daily workout. They mix up the exercises so it's never the same, I get bored easily when working out and I definetly don't have this problem here. There are a lot of different options and modifications to the exercises that make it possible for anyone to do. I highly recommend Jabz to everyone!",positive
"I work out at the Jabz Fitness on 32nd Street and north of Shea. Being that I have literally worked out SOLID since I have been about 20 years old and now that I am ... sigh.. in my 50s.. I have done all types of workouts in my time. This one is awesome! I was getting bored with my regular weight training routines that I do and I really like the challenge of this workout. It is all women (and they are of all ages/weights) so I think for most people it is a very comfortable, stressfree workout. But don't kid yourself... it is pretty hard. My abs have gotten a lot tighter as a result tho! The other thing that I like is that you can really change or minimize the workout for any injury that you have. I have had 4 knee surgeries and I have been told that my left knee is like 80 years old on the inside. Who knew? lol.. So that means that I have to be SUPER careful with what I do as now it is about maintaining that knee for longevity rather than being the toughest or fittest (that was the old me!) . With this workout, I can minimize my running/jumping/bending which is super important. Other workouts (like Orange Theory) are great for those who can comfortably do all that stuff. The other thing that I like is that all the girls in the classes are very supportive of each other and encouraging. That is what we women need! And the instructors are fantastic... just nice people who push you when you need to be pushed. The owner is a woman and I like supporting other business owners like me! Btw, I have also worked out at the Jabz on Scottsdale Road, and it seemed to be a trifle more difficult. Personally, I like that more but it is a farther jaunt for me to drive...",positive
"I was a tiny bit overwhelmed going into Jabz but I'd purchased a Groupon because I was looking to shake up my boring treadmill routine and this place looked interesting. I'm so glad I didn't get in my own way! Pros: Super friendly and knowledgeable staff and trainers New facility Great energy/support from fellow Jabzers (I just made up that word) A truly kick-ass workout. While I was watching the demonstration I thought, ""Eh.This looks easy."" Um. Yeah. Not so much. You go at your own pace but if the trainers see you slacking, they'll challenge you. I LOVED that. Cons: The North Phoenix location only has bikes and jump ropes for warming up. I'd love a treadmill and/or rower option. Overall, I really enjoy this place and plan to continue until the ""wave-goodbye"" flab is gone!",positive
"The one star off is because I can never get into the am classes - they're always full. I prefer working out in the morning and right now, I'm going in the afternoons. Which means that I don't go as often as I'd like due to my other obligations in the afternoon. With that said. Jabz rocks it and kick's my a$$ - pushing me in all the right ways! The trainers are knowledgable, great with modifications and making sure people are keeping good form. And I greatly appreciate their motivating attitude! It's important to note that it's not a boxing gym - it's a circuit training system where you get to punch a few bags. I bought the 15 session groupon and I'm on my 9th day. Even with enjoying this workout as much as I do, I don't know if I'll continue because of the morning conflict. However if a 5 or 6 am class isn't important to you - then I highly suggest you stop in and give this place a go!! The support is fantastic as is the workout!",positive
"Jabz is a fantastic high energy engaging workout. It is themed around boxing and keeps you engaged with different workout combos every day. There are between 14-16 stations for the full workout. You focus on each station for about a minute keying in on high intensity and high reps! The trainers are AMAZING! They get to know you personally, offer support and encouragement, and push you when you need more! The class environment is very friendly and welcoming. There are women there of all different types, shapes, sizes, and fitness levels! Jabz is a great option whether you are looking to just start becoming active or if you are looking to shake up your workouts and challenge your body! Bonus...they offer a free trial week and often run Groupon deals! I LOVE it!!",positive
"I struggle with being consistent in working out, but this place makes it easy! Each workout is new and challenging which makes me want to go every day! This is such a well run and clean business! The trainers are so personable and push you so you get the best workout for you that day! I have gotten some seriously awesome results because of these wonderful work outs! And getting my frustrations out on the bags each day make it that much more fun! You gotta check it out! They offer a free week! No excuses!",positive
"I tried the free week 6 months ago and only went once and wasnt feeling it but i was also not feeling physically well. After hitting a plateau at the gym and being too lazy to drive to my Zumba Classes. I decided to give this place another try, I am so glad i did! Ive been going every day for the last 2 weeks and this place makes me sweat. The gym or zumba never made me sweat the way this place does. The trainers are great, friendly and push you to your limits. I am also glad that this place is a block from my house no excuses!!",positive
I started with a Groupon back in January and have been hooked ever since! I go to class at least 3-4 times a week. The instructors are all great and will help you achieve that next level that often is hard to do on your own. I've lost almost 15 lbs and have so much more energy! This is one Groupon I didn't regret buying!,positive
Great workout! I Great staff. They are very friendly and helpful. I love that it is close to my house and that the hours work with my schedule.,positive
"Do not sign up for this gym if you're planning on using the bootcamp/""K-Fit"" room in the back. The room's floor is full of holes from people dropping the weights. It is simply a safety hazard to use their facilities: you risk seriously injuring yourself if lifting any amount of weight in there. They use subpar material for the floor and have not replaced it in over 6 months. They've actually received replacement pieces, but have it sitting at the lobby for the last couple of weeks. Not in a rush to fix it at all! Our class usually spends a couple of minutes before every workout trying to find what part of the floor is safe to stand on without stepping on any holes. It's surprising to see a gym whose staff cares so little about the health and safety of its clients.",negative
"Grand local plusieurs etages, vitrée, piscine exterieur, sauna, cours de groupe, section privée dans le vestiaire des femmes pour les poids ... funny.",negative
"This gym is walking distance from a metro. It's 24/7 and has great and fun classes (including outdoor classes) such as K-Fit, boot camps, spinning and so much more. The vibe of the gym is young and fun. You can go there and train like a beast, or have some fun with friends by the outdoor pool on the roof. The staff is super friendly and helps you with everything you need. The prices are amazing for what you get and all in all, it's a lot of great services that at any other gym will cost you over 100$ a month and the prices here are more than half of that. There is amazing trainers that can give you any assistance you need and they answer any questions you have. Really worth have a trial and seeing how you like it!",positive
This gym is terrible. Much of the equipment is either broken or not setup (including any of the fun features they try to sell you when joining).A little cleaning of the equipment that is functional wouldn't hurt.,negative
"I Like the fact that the gym is open 24h/7 days a week, great staffs, place is clean with an outdoor pool, big enough I always get my workout done, the only funny thing it's the dirty version of hip hop music that you can hear sometimes playing at the gym lol ..that's actually get me going ...twerk twerk ..",positive
"This is one of my favorite locations to workout at. The staff is very friendly and always greet me upon entering the club. The management is very passionate about helping others, and you can see that they take his/her job very serious. I'm very thankful that this gym is very close by my house and would recommend all my friends and family to give it a try. One of the best gyms in the valley.",positive
"I've been a member of LA fitness about a month and a half, and I've got to say I'm lovin' it! I purchased the personal training for a year. It's been so awesome, super challenging but so worth it. Can you say bikini body here I come?! I've been trained by Vlad who I highly recommend. He's super nice and has great exercises. Rob is my main trainer who is equally as wonderful. He really pushes you! They really listen to how you would like to transform your body, and guide you from there. It's been a great experience so far, and I can't speak enough about both these guys! Recommend them times a million!",positive
"I've received training from the staff at LA Fitness on Greenway and 7th Ave. Howard has been very helpful to me by teaching me about my target heart rate, the amount of exercise time I should expend to break through burning sugar in my system to burning fat. He has shown me the best ways to exercise that will bring me the most benefit. I highly recommend him and his staff.",positive
"UPDATE- I spent 4 months trying to get my money back. After June they no longer were supposed to charge me for personal training as the one year agreement was over. They continuously ignored my requests to cancel and STEAL my money every month. For 4 months, Craig the incompetent manager promised he would reverse the charges and never did. I spoke to him on Sept 25 and he told me the reason they hadn't refunded my money was because the regional manager was away in the army and they have 25,000 members (umm how is that my problem?). I gave it one more chance and he promised to call me the next day to update me. Guess what...NEVER CALLED! I finally am resolving the issue by myself by reporting this criminal activity, canceling my Credit card so they can no longer fraudulently charge me. Be warned do not sign up for the one year personal training.....because after that year is over they will continue to steal your money and they wont stop until you have to turn your life upside down and handle it yourself.",negative
"Disgusted with how I was treated. My buddy and I came in to check out this location as we tried out the LA on 32nd st bell Rd and there wasn't a lot of amenities. They gave us guest passes for the one on 3rd st and greenway so we could try out their amenities as we would need to get a membership regardless that allows us to go to any LA Fitness due to business traveling. Damien the salesman was a terrible disaster. He came at my friend and I like we were cheap pieces of crap and that ""we couldn't get anything for free"" Mind you the guest passes I had got were expired and never used and they still made us feel like we were total crap. I am beyond disgusted and was ready to get the family pack for this gym so my family can come as well. My company pays for our gym memberships so we could've had a great nice big family package but Damien wouldn't even allow us to tour. Will never return.",negative
Gym is big with lots of equipment. Down side is it is very stuffy and smells like body odor sometimes when it's really crowded. This place definitely needs more ventilation or fans.,negative
This gym is gross. It constantly smells like BO Atop that...they don't even have wifi. Wtf?? Everyone has wifi! SUPER annoying. I used to go to a nicer one in Scottsdale. This place is unacceptable. There are $10/month clubs nicer than this one.,negative
"Below 0 stars!! Went in, wasn't really happy with prices so manager dropped initiation fee to acceptable range but I didn't like the monthly payments. So he dropped that down too. I agreed. I was shown around, nothing special, in fact I don't understand how they advertise they have deep water aerobics when the pool is only 5 feet deep.. smh!! Received receipt via email 2 days later and saw the charges. Nothing as they said. I have no paperwork because there is no contract. I didn't have a calculator at the time to add what they charged me so i trusted them and just paid. I only have a credit machine receipt. Called mgr, said I was misquoted and there was nothing I could do. I called my bank. I am fighting this charge, never going back and getting a new credit card. FYI I never used any of their services, so they can't say ""well she came an used the equipment, etc."" very unhappy!! I wish there was a sports center like at a college where you can take one class for a certain amount of time for a set amount of money and leave it at that..at our community college in our small town in Texas we could join the sports center for $125 per semester and use all equipment. I just went for deep water aerobics and the pool was 12 feet..",negative
"I've been coming here for about 2 years now and like it, I feel comfortable with where everything is and always enjoy my workouts without having to wait for machines, as it is a large facility and plenty of equipment are available. I. An only speak for myself but I have not had any bad services so far. Front Desk staff is friendly, cleaning attendants always emailing, and my friend that I hired for a year ""Steve"" is the man. One note I'd like to make is that weights are often laying on the ground, even if I'm there at 4 am in the morning, I see the mess when I am there like the employees the night before didn't make an effort to tidy the place up. Part of the problem is the people training there who do not return the weights in their appropriate place, but employees also should take rounds and tidy the place up. I see plenty of sales/trainers/ and front desk staff doing nothing at times, and instead of just standing, may he stack them weight.",positive
"I just love this place. I can walk now, I can jump, I can dance. I can run short distances on the treadmill. I can practice my headstands, I can take a class, I can relax in the spa. I can invite my friends, I already have many friends who are members, and I'm starting to see more people in the community who also love being active. I definitely did not think I would reach today when I signed up, but I sure am glad that I did.",positive
"Let's start this review with the sexual predator that's creeping around in the men's shower room. Very lewdly flashing himself in the common area between showers; not the run of the mill old man with his dong hanging out, mind you, a bona fide sexual predator bent on showing himself to anyone that walks by. When he was called out, he hopped back into a shower stall but left the curtains open and was back at it in no time. He's got multiple tattoos on his forearms, a cross and something else. 55-60ish, tan with graying curly hair. Pot belly. Watch your children in this location - you've been warned, the location has now been warned.",negative
"I have been a member at this particular location for almost 10 years but I'm getting very irritated by their staff and I'm about to leave. The front desk girls are beyond rude. I hate dealing with them. Sales people and managers.....oh god, I'm not going to even waste my time on them. A friend of mine walked out last night and canceled his membership, I'm about to cancel it for both me and my wife. Or I might try a different location, but I'm definitely done with this particular one. I would rather pay little more at Mountainside and get treated like a human. I literally hate this place now.",negative
"I'm not a gym person, but I have enjoyed my experience at this particular LA fitness. Staff are friendly and helpful with signing up. I did a personal training session with R.D. Who was excellent. He is highly motivating and encouraging, but was responsive and adaptive when I hit my limit. I felt that a got in a great workout in a short amount of time with his help.",positive
One of the better LA fitness gyms in the valley. The four stars is strictly based upon other LAFs not all gyms. Spacious. The weight section is completely separate from the cardio machines. There are multiple squat racks and hammer strength machines as well as many benches. By far the biggest and best selection of weights and machines out of all the LAFs around the valley. No staff complaints. The guy at the counter badged me in and said have a good workout bruh...what more do you need? The locker room and facility was also very clean. I would work out here with no problems any day of the week. Those who are knocking this gym need to check out the other LAFs and see what crappy really is.,positive
"While I was trying to sing up, From desk girl was really rude, I thought front desk girl supposed to smile and help you with anything you need. I was for the not happy with that experience.",negative
"Don't waste your money or time with this club. The locker rooms smell like sewage and the machines are always dirty. The staff is extremely unhelpful...unless they are trying to upsell you. Also on a corporate level, god forbid something happens with your credit account and your payment is late...they will blow up your phone. I was at a funeral and my card had expired on my account. I received 26 phone calls in 3 days. If your trying to save money there are better cost effective options. If you like the full service club..pay the little extra and go with Lifetime.",negative
"Out of all the LA's I've been to in the valley, I'd say this is my least favorite. During the cycling classes and other fitness classes I've been to, something is always wrong with the instructor's equipment. It not only frustrates the instructor, but its a complete bummer when I'm feeling my workout high. I'm also a consistent lifter. You'd think with how crowded this location is they'd have enough spare cash to get some updated equipment. They also don't have enough bars for bench, incline & decline bench so whenever it's chest day, expect to wait, and wait...and wait for a bar. Do not go here between the hours of 5-8 during the week. I know those are the times when everyone is getting off work but damn, it's packed and you're constantly waiting for machines/benches/racs/etc. hard for me to get a good sweat in during these times, and super-sets are out of the question. Unless you're a cardio bunny you'll be fine; treadmills and ellipticals are always open.",negative
"I drove down today since a friend had just moved to the area and started frequenting this location. I went in and spoke with Daniel, who rudely explained to me that since I had used a pass within the last month that I could not use another one. I explained to him that my wife and I are shopping for gyms and he suggested I get a membership or pay $15 to workout there for ONE day. My friend showed up and told them he had been a member for 2 years and that my wife and I were considering getting memberships. The trainer came to tell me that ""this is a business."" Awesome ""business"" move turning down someone that can potentially bring in two new memberships. I will NEVER be a member after I see how your treat potential customers...so petty. AVOID THIS PLACE LIKE THE PLAGUE. Thanks for making my gym selection easier.",negative

"I I signed up with a trainer back in February. I spent almost 2 months observing this trainer and talking to her about goals before making the decision as it is quite the financial investment. After enough time I decided I wanted to try Personal Training again. While things started off great, after 3 weeks my trainer abruptly left. I was told by the Club Manager I could cancel if wanted but he wanted me to try working out with another trainer. I gave it a shot and was not satisfied. When I called to speak to RD, the Club Manager, and express my dissatisfaction and desire to follow through with cancellation, he suddenly reminded me that this was a contract and I couldn't cancel but would have to buy out my contract. This was the exact opposite approach from our previous discussions. After some back and forth and a few weeks of him failing to return a single call I was finally able to speak to him and we came to an agreement that I would not be charged for my 3rd and final month as in my opinion the contract, while binding was not fulfilled on their end by any means. I called back to confirm this and he guaranteed me that I would not be charged. I took his word and moved on. Just last week I was charged for services I was told I wouldn't have to pay for. Upon my trying to call him, not once or twice but 4 times, I have yet to receive a phone call back or a solution to the situation at hand. Only a voice mail reminding me that it was a contract and I had to pay for it regardless of my 100% dissatisfaction. I am not one to write a bad review, as this is my first,, however, in my experience with RD, the club manager, I have found that his words mean nothing and they fall flat. He is very quick to make promises with zero return. It is clear that customer service is not his priority. Additionally, this situation has made it clear that he is only out to cover his own behind and that he essentially lied to me and his boss about his actions. In hindsight, I very much regret re-joining LA Fitness. I would much rather have spent the money elsewhere and had a good experience and actual results. I would strongly recommend that if you are looking for personal training with actual results you seek another gym, as LA Fitness treats you as a number with a dollar number attached. My experience has made me realize that do not genuinely care for their members or their results and they are selling a false program. It is incredibly disheartening to learn that they care so little for their members after a $2000 financial investment of personal training.",negative
"Unsafe place for children! This is a complaint my husband and I made with CPS. Parent of Child and myself were walking towards spin class and we observed a man, who has a restraining order against him from the parent of the child entering the child care area. He was requesting for the child to come over to him. The parent of the child immediately ran into the child care area and I followed. I witnessed them arguing and her telling him to not touch or talk to her child. As he was trying to talk to the child I saw the child was extremely terrified of him. He proceeded to keep trying to allure the child over to come to him while the mother of the child protested and tried to get help from the staff. I was extremely concerned that he was trying to abduct or harm the child. The only staff member present was a young girl not knowing what to do. I immediately asked him to leave to step outside. I had to ask 2-3 times while he was still trying to get the child over to him before he complied. He finally did and we walked outside. I told him to leave the child alone and that he had no business in there harassing the child. He has no relation to the child and no children in the child care. Now the restraining order has been expanded to cover the child as well. My concern is that anyone can just enter this child care facility with no safety precautions and abduct a child. The child care area is also only five feet away for the entrance with nothing in-between. I contacted the GM of the gym on Sunday 3/29/2015 around 10:45AM Other Info: The parent of the child called the phoenix police department CPS won't step in to protect the kids either. Here is there response: ""We are in receipt of the online complaint you filed regarding LA Fitness Gym. The Gym is not licensed by the Department of Health Services as parents are on-site while their children are in care. Unfortunately, we have no jurisdiction over this matter and will be unable to assist you"" Avoid this Gym if you take your kids there. They are not Safe!!!",negative

"This location is a joke! I canceled my membership 2 weeks ago and unfortunately I had to escalate my problem to corporate. I canceled online and had the option of mailing the cancelation form or dropping it off by 5 pm. I went in and the manager Parag wasn't there, he went home early. So I left it with someone else who assured me Parag would do it first thing in the morning -keep in mind this guy never asked why I was canceling my membership, never asked to see what they could do to get me to stay, just said ok I'll give it to him. A little after noon the next day I called to find out the hold up. Parag said it's up to him if it gets canceled and he needs to review it first. IT'S NOT UP TO YOU! At no point does anyone within this company get to decide if I'm canceling my membership. I'm not under a contract. I paid my first and last months up front. You have my money and I'm not giving you anymore. He was unbelievably rude and condescending, he kept interrupting me and was clearly stationed on his high horse. So I called corporate who instantly canceled my membership. The reasons I canceled: Good luck working out between the hours of 5-7 during the week, you will wait and wait and wait to use any non-cardio machine. If you wanna prance on a treadmill chances are you can get one easily. But, if you're into strength training...good luck! My biggest problem with this gym is the hours. They close at 8 on Sundays and 10 Fridays and Saturdays. Seriously?? The sales reps they call personal trainers are pushy and rude. I was told by corporate they are able to sell individual training courses but according to the folks here they can only do the one year training membership...stop lying to your customers!!",negative
"So, I have been really wanting a gym membership and I finally made it in to check it out. I was looking for a gym that has lots of classes and a good amount of cardio machines. L.A. Fitness seemed like a great fit. It is really hot outside today and I was dying to work out. I figured L.A. Fitness had something where I could do a trial period so I could work out and see how I liked it. I want to make sure I feel comfortable working out there. If I liked it I would sign up. This sounds reasonable right? Basically, what happened was the guy at the front desk told me...NO, I had to sign up, pay sign up fee plus monthly membership fee then if I didn't like it they would give my money back. Also, if I didn't sign up today it would cost me more money. He kept throwing all sorts of numbers at me and talking fast so that I couldn't keep the numbers straight, he wouldn't write anything down for me so I could see how much all this would end up costing me and think about it. It was like trying to buy a used car. I hate high pressure sales. Also, to insult to injury he said,...""You look good but you really need to tone up a bit."" Really? Your going to insult me to get me to sign up for your membership today? I think this is a terrible sales tactic. NEVER do I spend money ANYWHERE that insults me. The only reason I currently do not have a gym membership is this sales tactic. So, in a nut shell I just walked out and will never go back. If you like high pressure sales and some guy commenting on your body, pointing out how tone you are or not, commenting on how many inches you need to loose, then this is your place. As for me I really hope to find a gym that is not like this.",negative
"Sometimes I feel like I'm here more than I'm at home so it surprised me that I hadn't actually reviewed this place yet. It's one of the bigger LA Fitness gyms I've been to so even when it's busiest I don't typically have to wait too long (if at all) for anything. There's a huge cardio room when you first walk in and then the weight training is a separate area down a hallway. Everything is kept pretty clean and if something is broken the staff is good about fixing it pretty quickly. The staff at the front desk varies, sometimes they smile and are friendly, sometimes you get the teenagers who don't look up from their phones, but seriously do you really want the person checking you into the gym to make conversation with you? Their job is to scan your keycard so you can go workout, so how bout you get to that and stop complaining.",negative
They have been billing me for a year now since I cancelled my membership. It is the worst system because once your in it you can't seem to get out. They keep calling you and billing you. Horrible place.,negative
"I wish you could leave a rating with 0 stars, because that is the quality of service you receive with LA Fitness! Where to start really...Monitor your account, they will try to double charge your account, and make charges to your account that they can't even explain themselves what the charges are from. Front desk is extremely rude so forget about asking any questions to the members that work there. Direct all your questions and complaints to the GM who is never there, and who never returns your phone calls. I could go on forever on this, but review space here is limited and my main focal point of frustration is their kids care service. Please, I repeat PLEASE do not bring your child here. If you love your child and care for their well being (as most parents do), do NOT bring your child here. The people that are paid to watch over and take care of your children do not even interact with them or watch them. Instead you can find them sitting in a corner playing on their cell phones or having inappropriate conversation in front of your children with other employees. If your child has any kind of altercation they discipline them by yelling at them and sending them to a corner until you pick them up. Now I don't mind disciplining my child my self when my daughter gets in trouble but I will be damned if someone else does it. If there is a problem the parent should be contacted immediately and let them resolve the issue. We provide the gym with both of our cell phone numbers that are with us at all times, and the part of the gym that we never leave. There should be no excuse not to contact the parent as soon as any kind of altercation takes place. A parent should never have to pick up their child who is crying uncontrollably, especially when the employees can't even tell you how long she was ""in timeout"" for. When picking up your child, you do not even have to provide any kind of identification, they go based on a ""we know what you look like"" policy. I mean come on we live in a city of over 4 million people, the odds that there are a few others who resemble me can be quite high. As a parent would you feel safe that just anyone can pick up your child without any kind of identification based on another employees assumption of who you are? This place is hell, avoid it like the plague and do not waste your money here. If you have no other alternatives just please avoid their child care services...",negative
"Compared to some of the other LA Fitness clubs this one rocks, was very impressed. I am happy it is so close to my house.",positive
Love the gym.. BUT heres the dealio.. dont just sell me a membership.. I still dont know where everything is.. heres why.. The staff NEVER .. nope.. NOT EVAH.. gave me a tour.. I had to ask another fitness girl where the ladies locker room was!.. Some of the ellipticals need replacing.. But the gym is cool.. So.. theres at least a 3.. staff.. hmmmm.. (no comment!),negative
"This gym is alright, it's always super clean inside and out. The equipment used to not be maintained but now it is. The only thing I don't like about this place is the staff. The sales people are super pushy and will call you 10x a day, no exaggeration. The front desk staff get real mad when you reach down 2 inches to scan your tag when no one is manning the desk LOL. This place also doesn't honor guest passes at all and they try and force your guest to talk to a salesperson to activate your guest pass. That's BS, you pay for guest passes as part of your membership. And just in general all the staff have just unprofessional attitudes and are always complaining about dumb stuff. It's like none of them had any other jobs before.",negative
Love to work out here love how there are many different locations near me and my work so I can get a great work out any time I need. Super clean equipment as well.,positive
"I have been going to fitness clubs for over 40 years. This facility is easily one of the cleanest and best maintained I have been in. It has numerous amenities and the equipment is well maintained. There are numerous grou classes for all fitness levels as well as personal trainers and a nutritionist. My personal trainer, Matt Shapiro, has been working with me for over a year and I am in the best shape of my life...great results for a 66 year old. Matt is knowledgeable and able to adjust to any ability level and weakness or injury. He is dependable and efficient and has helped me achieve and maintain my fitness level without spending many hours in the gym every day.",positive
"I am giving four stars because I've gotten pretty much everything I signed up for, but there have been nights when I wish it was open just a little later. It's in a convenient location to where I live in the West Valley and is never too busy to where I can't get a machine - and if so, it's a short wait. The staff is always friendly and courteous and aside from normal wear, the machines and mats are maintained pretty clean.",positive
Angie Witte is an awesome trainer! I've learned so much from her. Thank you Angie for showing me that I really am worth it and I can do it.,positive
"Awesome gym!! Matt and Travis are great!! They helped my son with asbergers to incorporate a new workout regimen and diet. They were very thorough and informative while working with him. My family and I had fun talking with them. The facility is clean, organized and well maintained. I observed no ""out of order"" equipment as well.",positive
"Gym is ok, however the trainers' staff is a completely different idea. No communication within the infrastructure of trainers. Trainers say one thing and do another. Promised education on diet, received none after 3 months. Go somewhere else!!! Not worth the money that they charge!!",negative
"Shady ass club!!! Don't do business with LA Fitness especially the one is Goodyear, Arizona. Poor customer service!!!! They want your money. That's all they care about!",negative
"NEGLIGENT, INDIFFERENT CUSTOMER SERVICE: The afternoon of Sunday 6 August 2017 I went to this LA Fitness to inquire about facilities and joining. The young lady at the reception desk was courteous and efficient. She immediately went to an area to the right, as you enter, where there were 3 young men laughing and joking around. She returned and said someone would be with me in a moment. They could see me standing at the counter, but continued laughing and joking, with no interest in a potential new member. The young lady kept looking over at them nervously but seemed hesitant to interrupt their playing around. After 10 minutes or more I walked out, with them still goofing off. I could understand if one employee fell short of standards.....but not three at the same time. If this is the customer service at the time you are trying to get a customer to join, I can't imagine how negligent it must be once they've gotten your money.",negative
"NEGLECT, NEGLECT, NEGLECT. Very disappointed with the LA Fitness corporation. The management and staff are very courteous and professional. There seems to be a methodical plan to recruit members. But I question if they are interested in retaining long term customers. First- The cardio equipment is old and wore out. I have on more than one occasion requested service on several treadmills because the belts slipped. This is no good for my back injury. Second- The weight machines are wore out too and (see attached pics) the attached pics convey that some of the equipment needs to be replaced. It should be noted that, to date, the management has not addressed the issue of wore out equipment for months now. Coincidentally, I checked the LA Fitness website and the corporate machine is still churning out new gyms, however, the infrastructure is neglected.",negative
"I like the gym, the classes and the equipment. I am not happy with the salesmen or manager. Someone called me to come in for a fitness examination. I didn't think I really needed one as I just came from CA where I belonged to a gym and already had an assessment. He talked me into coming in and to make a long story short, he belittled me by telling me I had the worst BMI he had ever seen and that I could get osteoporosis or diabetes. My doctor told me I have a perfect weight and excellent health. I was very pressured into buying a membership with a trainer and now don't want it as all I do with her is workout on equipment I already use when I come in. I am going to stop payments on all future charges. My trainer was wonderful but I just don't need her!!!",negative
"I'm happy with this gym overall except for the early closing hours. 9pm on Friday?! You should see the crowd walking out when they say it's time for you to leave. Not sure about all the reviews with rude staff. Everyone seems really nice. Perhaps all the rude people are gone or only work the day shift? Positives: Reasonable prices Friendly staff Not too crowded Big floor plan - open space Usually don't have to wait long for equipment if at all (depends on time of day) Equipment well maintained Nice pool, hot tub, courts Cons: Hours suck! No WiFi - TV's are on FM radio Only one heavy squat rack There's not really a good spot to do deadlifts or power cleans. But if you just want to walk on a treadmill, there are a ton.",positive
"I have been a member at LA fitness for over 4 years. The gym fits all my needs, various machines and good hours. I only have attended one of there boot camp classes but the over many different classes. After 4 years, I finally got around to having the complimentary body assessment consultation. Travis was very knowledgeable and informative. All the information he provided made sense and seemed realistic as far as goal setting. I would recommend Travis for this consultation. I haven't committed to the personal training program yet.",positive
I really do like this gym but hate the hours. Needs to stay open till midnight at least. Most likely will be switching to another w longer hours. Sad since I've been with them a long time.,negative
This is not a bad gym nor is it in a bad area. So props on that... My id we signed up yesterday. We were supposed to have a personal trainer show us what we need cause me and my mom are both larger. And the appointment was at 10. The guy said 10 minutes he is finishing up with someone that .. Its now 12:14pm and he has yet to come back to us to show us what to do. Now he is helping some other woman... So my issue is if you're going to offer a personal trainer. Try to have them actually help us with our problem areas. Rather than just ignoring us all together. Bullshit...,negative
"I love this gym. Everyone is super friendly from the time I joined until now. The professionalism and kindness hasn't changed. Everyone is willing to help. I especially love my trainer, Don. He is so professional and knowledgeable. I highly recommend La Fitness, specifically the Good Year location. I'm just a mom trying to get back in shape and this location is so convenient for me and my 2 young kids. They love the kids club so it makes working out that much easier. If I had to have one thing to complain about, it would be that I wished the kids club had evening hours on the weekends as well. That is my only complaint and hopefully that would be something corporate could consider especially for working moms trying to be faithful in their work out routine and trying to get in shape.",positive
The gym manager is rude and not cool at all please don't go to this gym ! She wouldn't let my brother go in just because he didn't have an ID even though he had gone to the other LA FITNESS on Dysart without any problem . I got guess privileges for two other ppl !,negative
"Just moved into the area and thought I would get some information about the membership since I live just around the corner from here. Went in and the manager Steve is unprofessional and extremely rude. Didn't even look up from the computer to provide information about membership, he just stared into the computer and didn't acknowledge my questions without trying to input my details (like name and phone number). I don't mind providing this info if I like the place, but if this is the treatment I would receive as a potential customer, I don't want to find out what the treatment would be like if I was a paying customer! Will not go here and do not recommend.",negative
"DO NOT go to this location . The staff is the laziest most unprofessional group of individuals I have ever met! The manager Steve felt the need to put my three year old in time out and ""pep talk"" him without contacting me, all because his receptionist didn't ""badge my son into the daycare"" which is not my problem. However instead of getting off their lazy asses to come find me (yeah because this gym is so massive you couldn't find me in a crowd of 20) he decided to take it upon himself just because he has ""5 kids"" I don't give a crap how many kids you have, You could have 60 and I still don't consent you to put my child in time out and talk to him about any issue. You're a damn gym manager not a counselor . I would also love to add how a manager in a place of business does not want to give his name to me. Good thing I asked your lazy social media scrolling employees your name before I left.",negative
I've been coming here since it first opened and have always been happy with this location. Never gets too packed anytime of the day and plenty of parking. Its not the biggest but still has everything you need.,positive
"Don't join unless you plan on staying with this gym FOREVER. Trying to cancel your membership is more difficult than achieving world peace. I specifically joined because they have a lap pool but the chlorine is so ridiculously high, it makes me sick. I advised the front desk and was told it's monitored and kept at a safe level. Silly me. I guess it's normal to find it difficult to breathe in the pool area due to the overwhelming chlorine smell. It's also normal to be unable to open your eyes under water for fear of them burning out of your skull. And, it's pretty normal to be sick after being in the pool... I think I'll just stick to my DVD's for now. I've made more progress toward my fitness goal in my living room than I ever did at this gym anyway. :/",negative
"This is my first time ever giving anyone a review, but I felt I had to share... anyone thats planning on opening up a membership here please beware. I signed on 2 months ago, the ""manager"" told us they were remodeling and adding other activities, like racket ball (which is what my son was interested it), he said I could change the membership name to my husband's if i found myself not going often. Well today I went to switch the membership name to my husband's and come to find out, 1. Im not able to, 2. they are not remodeling/adding anything, and 3. he was not the manager, infact he was just fired for providing customers with false information. I was told to call the Corporate office and let them know the situation to see if they could help me with the name change, well corporate told me they could help. ... but i would have to pay $99.00. I asked her why i would be charged for making a change to my account if when i signed up i was told i could, they fired the guy for lying but still want to charge me . Again.....please make sure you get the correct information and you review everything before signing anything, it's clear they cannot be trusted, and instead of helping they still want to go after your money.",negative
"Called the corporate office to cancel my membership and told I have to contact the local club. Call the local club and told I have to come in person to speak to the manager to cancel. I said, I have not been in there in a year (been paying the whole time) and I'm not coming in there to cancel. Cancel it now. Nope, have to come in and speak to the manager in person during the week between 9-5. I work out of the area and am not available M-F between 9-5. I HATE businesses that hold you hostage and will never support this POS place again. I guess I keep paying these crooks until I can take vacation and make it in to see the manager at his convenience. The joke is on them though. I just wanted to cancel my personal membership and leave my families memberships active. Now I'll be canceling ALL my memberships, screw you LA Fitness.",negative
The employees are very rude. Every time I ask for help w/ machines they act like I should already know how to use everything. Whenever I ask questions they act as if I am bothering them. They argue w/ their customers. One time I gave my membership card to man at front desk and he threw it back at me. I asked for the manager to speak to the employee who threw the card at me and turns out he WAS the manager! I'm going to be contacting corporate and suggest anyone who has a membership here or planning on getting one do the same.,negative
The manager here Kevin is the worst manager I have ever seen. Instead of him doing his job and make sure the club is running right he takes time out to give paying members a hard time about stupid stuff. Has to be the worst customer service I have gotten. If you are thinking about signing up just pay a little extra and go to Lifetime Fitness.,negative
"I usually go to a different location, so this was my first time here, and last. First off when I walked in no one greeted me with a hello and so I checked in and took my 3 year old and 8 month old into the kids care center, there was at least 20 kids in there with 2 teachers, my daughter is 8 months she was the youngest there, as I walked out I asked the ladies at the front desk what was the amount limit of kids per teacher she said 12 I said OK, I went to work out for about an hour and a half and when I went in to pick my kids up there were about 7 kids, my daughter was in a baby swing SCREAMING and crying at the top of her lungs, not strapped in and another 2 year old pushing the swing at its hardest, as soon as I walked in I immediately heard my baby crying and the teacher was conversating with another parent, I picked up my baby and she stopped crying. My son at the time when I walked in was trying to unlock the gate and so he saw me instantly. I talked to a supervisor and he (Kevin) seemed careless. I would not recommend this LA fitness, not a very good facility all together!! I wouldn't even rate it a one star.",negative
I had a really bad experience at another gym in town so I was hesitant to join another gym. But with the summer temperatures I didn't want to work out outside and this gym is close to my house. They gym itself is a nice facility and includes a pool and hot tub as well as dry saunas. The only thing I would say is unless you are interested in signing up for personal training skip the complimentary fitness intro because all they do is a hard sell on personal training. The front desk staff can be a little grumpy at times that's why I only gave 3 stars.,negative
Worst customer service reps I have ever dealt with. They're rude on the phone and on site. About to terminate my membership with them.,negative
Been a member since gym opened and it has just gone down hill. Kids throwing a football around the gym at the Entrance inside. Trainer's having inappropriate conversation while on the clock. To bad it use to be a great place to work out.,negative
"I really don't like to do more than two reviews of any given place, but I feel like I should. I went here yesterday (and a few times last week) and I'm not sure what their problem is, but they are incredibly pushy! The last few times I went (which ultimately made me decide to tell/warn people), I have handed over my key card thing they scan and usually hand back. Well, the person handling it holds the card (with all my keys attached) and asks me if I'm interested in this, or that (yesterday it was an assessment with a personal trainer). The time before yesterday, one of the guys got me to fill out information on my boyfriend to call him to let him know about the gym. I was under the impression I was going to be given a two week pass to bring home to him, but nope. Each time I come here, I've set aside half an hour to 45minutes to get in a work out. I'd rather be left alone then hassled (they don't like when you tell them ""no"" and keep pushing the issue). I've had the same guy at the L.A. Fitness on Rancho Sante Fe be annoyingly pushy, ""What're you gonna be doing today?"" ""Are you sure you don't want to speak with a trainer?"" But this place is ridiculous! I almost hate going to the gym for totally different reasons than I always leave sweaty and hate the duration of my 35minutes of cardio. This is a 1 and a half star which comes from the place being brand new and having new equipment. Oh, and its closer to my house than the other LA Fitness.",negative
Nice facility but I could not get them to stop billing me. My daughter moved to college and it took 8 months for them to stop the membership. They even billed me $49 for the next year fee on top of the $19.95 regular monthly fee. I hate auto deduction fees because they suck the money off of you and you have to give an arm and leg to end the contract. Finally the corporate office agreed to stop.,negative
"This LA Fitness location is not so bad. One of the only locations in the area with rack ball courts. They did some remodeling a few years ago, which made it better. Much much much better than the bethel park LA Fitness. One downfall, which can't really be fixed, is building is concrete with not many windows except in the very front, so it's hard to get good cell reception to use data for music streaming. The group fitness classes are decent and available multiple times a day with a variety of different classes. The locker room is usually pretty clean, but the bathrooms are hit or miss. Nothing is worst than being on a public sweaty place & the restrooms being out of soap or toilet paper. This happens semi often at this LA fitness location & they could do a better job at cleaning the bathrooms as well. One thing I like about this location is the stand where you can grab a snack, protein shake, smoothie or even buy a towel Incase you forget yours and need to shower. Super convenient. They offer childcare too for a fee for all you parents with small children. If you're considering a cheap local guy, LA fitness bridgeville is probably your best bet.",negative
"I have been a member of this gym for about a year and a half. Do not waste your time or money on the personal trainers. They are fine people but they are constantly changing and short-staffed making it hard to schedule appts. The gym could use some updates too, especially in the showers. They remind of my high school locker room. I also constantly find myself waiting for machines because someone is sitting there looking at their phone. There is no monitoring by staff to make sure others are not taking up space either looking up music or chatting on their phones whilst reclining on a machine someone else is waiting to use.",negative
WORST GYM EVER!!!!! I have been a member there for 3-4 years. I have seen them go through some bad times before but this time is the worst. So bad I cancelled my membership!!!! THE GYM HAS A REAL BAD ODOR TO IT!!!! The management is the worst I ever seen since I been going there. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY.,negative
The gym smells. People seem mostly there to pick up others. Staff is more interested in looking at their phones than being helpful. Avoid.,negative
"I mostly go here for ""cardio days"". The spin classes are the best. They have the stair master, that is hard to come by if it's busy. I generally do not lift at this gym because it's always so busy and the way it's set up, the machines are organized in a way that doesn't really make sense. But overall, a good places for cardio with many different machines to choose from.",positive
"They will tell you the support you will get and what you want to hear when you are first signing up, after that you are 100% on your own. Also they try to sell you very expensive private trainer classes. DON'T DO IT !! During the most common times to go the place is way too crowded.....",negative
"Best LA Fitness location in the entire chain! Try the SPIN classes, instructors are the BEST and the work-out will kick your a**....I would go into town just for the classes. Warning: this is also the fittest gym that I have ever been in, and it would intimidating to someone who is just starting out. After work it gets crowded, and it is tough to find a spot in the free weight area....",positive
I became a member of this location in 2011. I signed up for personal training at the beginning of 2012. In July of 2012 my trainer began making comments about finding me attractive. Shortly after he began text messaging my personal phone to continue pursuing his interest. I complained to management and asked to cancel my contract. I was told I would be contacted by corporate headquarters and it would be taken care of within 24 hours. After 5 days I gave up hope and filed a police report against the trainer after being contacted yet again by him. That night the District Manager contacted me to tell me that I have no grounds for cancelling my contract and she won't allow it. I am now being forced to pay $200 per month for a membership and personal training that I am too uncomfortable to use. Not to mention the trainer is still employed at this location.,negative
"This LA Fitness has been through an emotional year that I won't get into. It's got lots of workout machines, a huge 4 lane pool and lots of great people working there. One problem is the pool area always seems to be out of order, sometimes it's the ventilation being down or the jacuzzi not heating up. We've complained to managers and they say corporate doesn't want to pay to fix the problems. ""Hey corporate, you gladly take our membership dues every month, so give us equipment that works!"" With that said, I'm going back to my abs workout and wondering why I'm putting myself through this Hell called fitness. Oh and for some reason when you are standing right in front of this building and try to check in on Yelp, it says you are 3 miles away and too far to check in. Weird!",negative
"Became a member three weeks ago. So far, I haven't had any issues. Will be going to the new one at Hurontario and Eglinton when that one opens June 1st, 2017.",negative
"This gym has a ladies section which is quite stocked in terms of equipment. Women of all shapes and sizes come and use this section. The women's change room is huge here. It even has a hot tub in it. I noticed that whenever equipment is out of order here, that it often gets fixed within 1 to 2 weeks. The other general open area of the gym has lots of equipment. This place is clean and neat. I recommend this gym.",positive
"Ive been a member for years and let me tell you, the staff is HORRIBLY rude! Anything you say or do, they always have something to say back to you. Woman bathrooms smell like poo all the time (at the time of making the place they messed up the bathroom, that's what they told me) and never got it fixed till this date. I told them to get atleast like 5 air freshners so we arent dying in there but guess they're too cheap for that. When u are done washing your hands theres no papertowels, why? Cause they dont have funds to provide it. They need to just get a whole new team of staff.",negative
"Don't sign up. This gym is really bad in so many ways, and has consistently been so for the last several years. It's now 2015 and I'm going to switch to a gym further away, out of frustration. Several problems at this gym: * Change rooms are not maintained. Consequently, it's too icky to take a shower in there. I shower at home in the Spring/Summer/Fall. But in the winter, I want to be able to shower at the gym. So I finally decided to leave the club, even though it is very close to home. * Sinks in the men's change room (hand sensor based) are constantly not working. One out of three sinks (the middle one) is what everyone uses. Everyone knows that's the only one that reliably works. I've mentioned this problem on several occasions over the last few years. It never gets fixed. YEARS PASS. They just don't give a rat's ass. * Urinals in men's change room are constantly under some kind of repair. Just replace the damn thing at the source of the problem. * Like many gyms that are out of touch, they've got a huge inventory of cardio machines that are never fully utilized, even at peak times. Conversely, the free-weights and weight-equipment that the membership IS interested in, is always busy. * Only 2 power racks in this gym, and constantly being waited on. What a waste of time. It's like being stuck in traffic on your drive home. I've tried making constructive suggestions; there's no place to even formally complain or make your suggestion. * I spoke to the Operations Manager (Jacquie), ""Hey, can I make a suggestion about needed equipment?"" and she'll shut you down. ""Sorry, we only have plans to fix what we have"". I respond, ""But you need more Power Racks. They are busy even off-peak. Get rid of the cardio equipment assets that are underutilized. Rebalance your equipment portfolio."". She's not going to hear it. She's the operations manager and didn't even know what a ""Power Rack"" referred to. No suggestion box either. No one wants to hear your suggestions. * I followed up, ""Well, someone has the authority to change equipment. Maybe your boss; maybe your boss' boss. Who could change the equipment if they wanted to?"" The answer I got: ""No one"". Basically, LA Fitness wants your money, and for you to have no expectations about cleanliness, availability of equipment or equipment that works. And they don't care about whether the gym is meeting the needs of their members. This place needs to get taken over from LA Fitness, renovated and run by someone else.",negative
"I like LA, but not this location. It looks a run down gym, every machine is close to another, it's unorganized as there's some cardio up and down stairs. Free weights are in the middle and it looks like a zoo. Machines are older than the other LAs I've been. Changeroom is huge and nice, staff are friendly. I just don't like the closeness of every machine and not many of the ones I use to be at this gym. If it's close to home it's better than nothing but I prefer to go to another LA.",negative
"This is a ""meh"" gym. I'll list my pros and cons below. Pros: -solid staff that will help you when you need help with workout routines, specific exercises and/or meal plan advice -the gym is never so busy that you can't work out Cons: -customer satisfaction sucks: I tried to get reimbursed for training sessions I had paid for ....had to jump through loops, call the head office in the States, and I don't know how many wasted hours talking to people ....to no avail. Still didn't get my refund. I finally caved and simply used up my remaining sessions -there is an ever-present focus on buying training sessions. Although the staff is friendly and helpful, they'll drop the ""you should get training sessions"" line all the time. They will still help you, but you just have to keep saying no to their advances TL;DR: Mediocre gym with staff that are always hounding you for training sessions.",negative
"Just don't - I thought I'd give the LA fitness brand another try as this location was closer to my work. Colin, was fairly nice but has no spine in regards to customer loyalty and/or future business with clients. He is apparently the director or manager of the club. Went to use a 3 for 3 pass (3 guests for 3 days) and was told I was not allowed to use it as I was a previous member at another LA fitness a while back. I had a friend with me, who was also told that he could not use the pass as he was a GUEST last November at the LA fitness in Brampton and therefore we both would have to pay the $15 guest fee. Needless to say, I told them that if I was paying, I would not be paying them. We drove to the Goodlife Fitness at Vodden, the staff let us in for free and asked no crazy questions and were very polite. They even offered to hold our bags/coats as we worked out as we did not have a lock with us. Afterward, no pressure to sign up. Literally, showed us the prices and we walked out. Apparently, all LA fitness gyms are built alike. I told the manager that this was not the appropriate way to do business with a client who had a membership with you for over a year at another location and I would've considered a membership had this experience been better. Apparently, that meant nothing to him. Don't expect loyalty, cleanliness or friendly service from this brand, frankly twice at two different locations can't be a coincidence.",negative
"Preparing for a destination wedding is a lot of work! Training with Lonnie gave my fiancé & I the motivation, drive, and ability to prep for our special day!",positive
Horrible gym!! Do not waste time or money here and if you ever do want to cancel your membership it will be absolutely impossible to do. This place sucks every way it can!,negative
"The only reason for one star is because they cant go lower. My minor son was pressured into signing a contract for Personal Training. $250 a month. This happened on a Friday, his mom went in on Saturday and the person who sold him the contract said he couldn't do anything till the Regional Manager gets back on Monday. I guess the employees don't understand a minor can't bind a contract. We never had this problem with Mountainside. This kind of BS hurts the fitness industry.",negative
This place is always dirty and the staff are horrible. I don't understand why they even hire people for the front. I usually am checking myself in while the employee is usually talking to friends huddled around the desk or on the phone. No one ever greets you or attempts to break a smile. Anytime you try and ask them a question they make you feel like you are bothering them. There are several other gyms around the area with better equipment and employees with great customer service skills. Canceling my membership asap.,negative
"This LA Fitness is prone to get busy especially after school gets out--since it is across the street from Hamilton High. Downside of this location is that it's pretty small overall, there's only 3 squat racks, basketball court is smaller than normal (basically no 3 point line on the sides), doesn't have racquetball courts like other locations. Also have had issues with people at the front desk. Been bounced around when asking for assistance when trying to adjust my membership. Told by various workers that another person would take care of me, came back on different days because they weren't there. And then finally told that only one person had the clearance to do it and she only works at a time frame when I was unable to come in. Ended up going to the other location off of the 202 and Gilbert--and their front desk person was much nicer, and changed my adjusted my membership right then and there.",negative
The place is gross. They rarely clean. Weekends the garbage just overflows and the men's locker room looks like a garbage dump.Managmebt does not care and walks right by it. The machines up stairs are full of hair and dirt from never being cleaned. Just a gross gym. I have been to other La fitness that are clean. NOT THIS ONE. AVOID,negative
"I certainly been to better facilities for fitness. Pro's: Close to my house Typically not overly crowded The meatheads are fairly quiet and to themselves It's not a bunch of people looking to hook up at the juice bar (because it's probably not open anyway....) Nice equipment and plenty of it. It's clean, but I don't use the locker room, or showers. I only use the weight room and upstair cardio machines. Con's The water from the water fountain is nasty and only 1 in the entire building? Just don't forget your own water. Front desk is often on the phone when you walk in and can't be bothered. Opens at 8am on the weekends? This was as close to a deal breaker as I could get. If it wasn't 20 bucks a month and 3/4 mile from my house I'd probably have cancelled my membership. Lastly, if you have your membership hooked up to a debit card that you lose or have to cancel for fraud purposes.....get ready. You will have a tidal wave of LA Fitness telemarketers lighting your phone up several times a day. It comes across as really desperate. Don't worry LA Fitness you'll get your twenty bucks, I promise....if I come back.",negative
"People, pleasant enough lazy. Usually can get on equipment easily. The bad part is the showers are always gross. Floors are dirty and have clean streaks where people track in pool clorine. I was really grossed out once seeing brown stuff in shower but then saw hair dye treatment in small trash cans. There are always clumps of hair and sometimes qtips in drain. I started carrying Lysol spray in my gym bag. I complained about dirty condition of the bathroom and showers they said it was just cleaned.!",negative
Personally I love LA fitness. It's a great place for me to go right after school. It gets VERY crowded between 4:30-7 as people get home from work and can barely get on any machines or benches. The place is full with meat heads who are fairly rude but I just ignore them. Overall great experience here for the last 2.5 years,positive
"I've been a member for 2 years. 2 stars because I really don't like that they open so late on the weekends (8:00). I've never had to deal with the staff, so no comment there.",negative
"I liked this gym but sadly I have to cancel after only having the membership for a month. When I originally signed on I was not informed of the hours and I work crazy shifts. I just went in for a workout thinking the gym stayed open until 11pm every day except Sundays. I get pretty sick if I don't workout after drinking pre-workout, so now I'm stuck & pretty nauseous. The juice bar was amazing too! I'm so upset. I wish I could just get my money back.",negative
"Having a GREAT experience at my new gym. The facility is amazing, the training staff is knowledgable and friendly and service oriented. The Kiwi juice bar is top notch, as well.",positive
"On 5/15 my friend and I went into this LA Fitness, I have a membership and I tried to put her on my guest pass for the second time this year. When we went in and they told her she can't use a guest pass for the second time, they tried to sell her a membership card. The guy said they have a sale going on but didn't explain the sale so my friend said no thank you. He kept pushing her after she said no a few times. Finally he said it would be $33 a month and she said no because she has a membership at YMCA for free and his response is ""what? You can't afford $33 a month?"". That's when I got mad and I said ""she said no."" I will be cancelling my membership from this LA Fitness because of his comment. That was absolutely ridiculous of him to say and he has no right to assume someone's budget and what they can or cannot afford.",negative
"I've been a member of this organization for several years. I go to a few different locations but mainly end up using this location quite a bit except for within the last few months. The reason would have to fall upon the constant high turnover of staff which results in a serious problem of them being incredibly rude and unfriendly at this location. Even their GM Greg is absolutely terrible with the members. I've witnessed this time and time again. The front desk girl, Maria, is the absolute definition of complete rudeness and all about attitude. Talk about a LA Fitness location going down the tubes for having pretty good equipment, amenities, etc. They are losing more and more members either to other locations or different gyms in general that provide better customer/member service. Once you're a member, they don't seem to care about you. I'm considering canceling my membership all together to find a better fit facility to work out at.",negative
Mariella has provided me with a Happy Face and courtesy every time I check in at this location! This is sadly not always the case with some of the other locations. But I digress as this POST is all about Mariella and her stellar customer service!! Thanks Gal!!,positive
"Just started this week. Haven't had unfriendly staff but they don't seem to like to answer a straight question. I signed my kid up for the kids club, the lady refused to give me the print out. Nice selection of machines, sauna is nice, pools are over cholrinated and showers kinda suck but you get clean. The folk in the kids club seem nice enough and engaged with the children. About the only staff I don't feel simply see everyone as a walking $.",negative
Zero customer service. When you walk in front desk person looks down or talks to another employee. Doesnt acknowlege anyones presents. Hardly any good classes. Employees are rude!! Makes me not want to go to gym.,negative
"After our favorite instructor for Zumba left, it has been a challenge finding a good Zumba class at LAF. The instructors change constantly and the management and staff / front desk are unfriendly. I have been member here since it started and had recommended 3 others because of the one good Zumba instructor we had. With her gone, this place has nothing worth going back to. Unfriendly staff, worst management. The one star is for comparatively clean facility.",negative
If I could give zero stars I would. My wife and I are in the process of relocating to Chandler from California and we came into this LA Fitness because we called and spoke with Alan. We told him our situation and he said that he would be happy to give us a 7 day pass while we were town. We were given to Greg in customer service and this guy treated us horribly. He said he wouldn't give us a free pass because he always gets of town people coming in and trying to get a free workout. He said we could workout today but after today it would be $15/day. After our workout my wife went back to Greg and wanted to explain our situation one more time and he reiterated that he let us workout today and that should be good enough. My wife again voiced her displeasure with his attitude and asked for his name. He refused to give her his name or the number to corporate. STAY AWAY FROM THIS GYM AND GREG AND HIS HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE.,negative
"Nice spacious gym with quality equipment but The cycling classes and nothing like their video . there is no energy in the classes, there is hardly any people . The instructors are not motivating the music is terrible you can't even hardly pedal to the beat of the music because it either too fast away to slow according to what you're doing with the instructor, instructor is not even in sync with the music. Do these instructors have any qualifications or they just make it up as they go along? https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=MIQU5GOHNfI# Classes are not even close to what this video shows!!",negative
"While the club is nice the employees are unfriendly!!! If you don't like your job, leave. Let's start with the front check in counter. WTH ( what the hell) if you think they are warm and inviting, they are not and far from it. Management get a clue. Pls. Get a clue this is the worst possible display of friendliness or customer service I have ever seen! This is not Golds Gym like back in the 80ies. This is 2016 please treat people with kindness, friendliness and willingness! The trainers - one guy looks so out of shape and that inspires people? No way Today 10/09 the doors did not open until 8:30. LATE unacceptable!!!! The juice bar opens so late. Hello!! How is that servicing your patrons??? It's not. Waste of time Hours of operations sat & sun 8 am who made this rule. People like to get their workouts done before 8. Do you get it. This is a fitness club Not sure why I continue with this place. 24 fitness why did you sell to La Fitness? Please come back... I beg you. Do you need a new club manager? I'll apply for the position. The patrons are more friendly that the employees. Member services - I can't even comment on that. The whole place needs a training class on how to treat customers. This is not a positive environment. Sincerely disappointed!",negative
"Okay, so ...first off I have not been to this location in over a year. When I had attended this location it was simply for the yoga classes, and they were cancelled multiple times. I understand, people get sick ..things come up. My complaint is this morning at 8:08 I had received a call from corporate telling me that my card on file needed to be updated. Not news to me because I knew it had expired as of the end of this month. No problem gonna go online and update it. I go about my morning and get on a routine morning business call. At 8:42am just a little over 30 min from my first call from LA fitness I get a beep in on my phone call I am currently on from a local 480 # I do not know. Seeing as how I am on an important business call I hit ignore. They proceed to call back quite rudely FOUR times in a row. I hit ignore each time obviously cause the incoming call cuts into my current conversation. This is completely unprofessional and unnecessary. They did not leave a voicemail or GET THE HINT until after the fourth time calling. I WILL NOT be going back to that location. Also, whoever is making those calls needs a lesson in professionalism and needs to drop their attitude before picking up a phone to speak to paying customers.",negative
"I really like this LA Fitness. Since they opened in 2014, I have been a regular at this gym. It's not a big as some of the other LA Fitnesses, but there is a nice neighborhood feel to it. It doesn't get to busy and they have a nice selection of machines. The staff has always been great. Things I like are the juice bar, the large area they have for stretching and the upper level for bicycles and tread mills. My only con is that some of these newer LA Fitnesses have smaller pools (2 to 3 lanes).",positive
"I was at this location earlier this week around 7 pm. My wife and I went upstairs to use the treadmills. Most of the open ones were covered in sweat. I am not talking lightly. It was though they were sprayed. I went downstairs to tell the manager who could have cared less. His response was ""which one is dirty"". My reply was that most of the open ones needed to be cleaned. He smirked and did nothing. Other members came upstairs, looked for a celeb machine, and left. What was amazing to us was the fact that three employees were hanging out at the front desk, including the manager when we left. Not one of them ever climbed the stairs to look into the issue. What a joke. After several years of being a member, Lifetime fitness is looking better and better. They respond to things like this.",negative
"I love this location. I've been to many LA fitness locations in AZ and CA. They are not all the same. Every time I go I see a lady wiping everything down. The whole time and she doesn't stop. Personal trainers don't follow you around and push what you don't want. Class instructors are really awesome here. So enthusiastic, keep me pushing and seem like they love their jobs. Juice bar is SO good. Skip Starbucks.....feed your body something nutritious. The kids love coming to play in there child care. TV's on their treadmill (catch a show while doing cardio). Some days I catch a class, some days I'm on the floor, I've even came just to let the kids burn energy and let mama relax in the sauna. Whatever you choose to do....this is a great gym.",positive
This is a steroid friendly gym. If you are looking for a relaxed neighborhood workout spot or you are female this is not a good place to go. I was there a few days ago and sat down three mats away from a walking advertisement for steroid abuse. He demanded I move right next to someone else because friends of his were coming to the gym. Not wanting to workout shoulder to shoulder with someone else when there was plenty of space available I told him I would move when his friends showed up (they weren't even at the gym and probably did not exist). This enraged him and he got up and kicked a workout ball at my head. On the way out I complained to the front desk. The guy acted like it was my problem. The roid user came over and started screaming at me that he was going to hurt me and to go outside and fight him. The desk guy knew the other guy and was talking to him by first name and openly sneering at me. I saw the same front desk guy today and asked if he spoke to the guy about his behavior. Again he was rude and pretended for the first two minutes not to remember what happened! Then he said he didn't know the guy at all despite calling him repeatedly by his first name and then he said something about how he weighed 315 pounds. The implication was that I better do what he said. There are a lot of gyms around this one is not worth your time or money.,negative
"I've been a member here since the doors opened a year ago and I go 6 days a week so I feel I have a pretty good grasp of this gym and can provide an honest assessment. Here goes: First, the staff who work the front desk are rude, condescending and could care less about your very existence. I've never been to a gym with worse customer service. I don't expect much but when you walk in they never so much as say hello. Not a smile or a welcome or ""hi, how are you?"". Nothing. They can barely muster the enthusiasm to lift their heads from their cell phones to scan you in and even that annoys them. Some just put the scanner on the counter and point to it so that they can minimize their human interaction even further. The pitiful customer service is a sign of extremely poor managment and poor hiring standards. Then there is the personal trainers and since I was a trainer back in the day and owned my own business I can't help but watch them from time to time and collectively they are a real disappointment. There are a couple who seem to put in some effort but the majority just stand there with their clipboard and count reps, staring off into the distance just waiting for the client to tire out so they can move on. I'm sorry but if you pay for a ""professional"" trainer you should get 100% of their attention and energy. Lastly, the facility is OK. There's enough equipment and variety to keep everybody moving. Unfortunately, they do very little to enforce some basic gym etiquette like replacing your weights when you're done. Most free-weight machines remain fully loaded as the previous user simply walks away and let's others clean up their mess. There are dumbbells and barbells littered througout the gym as users just leave the weights when they're done. It's sad but there are a lot of people at this gym with very poor gym etiquette and the management does nothing to hold members accountable. If there was a gym closer to my home I would certainly cancel my membership and probably will eventually. For now I put up with the horrible customer service and can only hope that one day one of them will be sitting before me for a job interview where I can return the favor!",negative
Gym is nice and new. Kids club is terrible and they don't offer enough classes or times. Staff is not that friendly. Canceling my membership for a gym with more options.,negative
Well. I was happy when I was working out there. The gym is fine. But I mi ex back to San Francisco. I cancel my membership. And here start the hell. Cancel a month ago. The guy I spoke with never did what I ask to. Just to cancel it. And I got a bill the month after. And when I called. Every time they transfer to a different guy. They been very rude. And I get phone calls few times a day for the balance that I don't even owe. The Meneger say. Witch I think it's stupid. Oh I am sorry. You cancel your member ship the day I wasn't here. And I am the only one who can do it. Really ? Silly people,negative
"Equipment and machines are decent. They have everything you need. However, the staff are rude and only want your money. GM is a jerk, and all the trainers are the same way. Don't expect any hook ups or deals that would actually benefit you. Canceled and never going back. Mountainside Fitness is less busy, and have better customer service.",negative
"We initially joined here because we found the staff to be friendly, attentive and courteous! The facility is in the perfect location and has plenty of great equipment. We love the variety of classes offered as well. Brandon the fitness director assessed our needs perfectly! He checks in with us regularly to ensure we are still on track and meeting our goals! We receive expert training from Ramsey - He got us started on the right path immediately and has kept us motivated to stick with our work out plans! The people and atmosphere here enabled us to achieve our fitness goals!!",positive
"I normally go to a different location but wanted to check this one out because it was near my work. First of all, when I walked in the guy at the front desk didn't even greet me and his look on his face made it seem like I was just inconveniencing him. Also, this location is super outdated and just plain ugly. Not to mention it was super dirty and gross I didn't even want to set my gym bag down. Unimpressed and disappointed.",negative
"Josh was very prompt in regards to contacting me shortly after I signed up for a membership online. Once I met with him, he was informative, friendly, and motivating. I would definitely recommend him for any personal training needs!",positive
"From ALL of the terrible reviews floating around in the cybersphere - from Google reviews to Yelpers - about LA Fitness in general, and this location specifically, you would think management would intercede and get their act together, but they haven't, probably because they are about to close this location. I've been to gyms that are about to close before and this is about how it looks and acts. Against ALL judgment, I went into this location today to check out their elliptical machines. No one was at the front desk when I walked in, but 2 teenage kids on duty (without any adult supervision) were sulking at desks in a dark corner. Neither of them greeted me or smiled at me. Finally, one of the kids got up SUPER slow and walked slower than I have ever seen a young person walk over to the front desk and asked in a monotone voice and with a totally bored expression on her face if she could help me. I said I was shopping for a new gym, and I just wanted to take a quick look around and see what kind of elliptical machines they had. She said she would have to have someone take me around. I said that was fine, but that I was really in a hurry, so her person taking me around would have to be super quick. She gave me a really hard look and said it would take 20 minutes. I informed her I would not be spending 20 minutes at the club, I literally just needed to run upstairs and take a quick look at their elliptical machines. She asked if she could get ""some information"" from me and I said no and repeated for at least the third time that I just needed to take a quick look at their elliptical machines. She took two timid SUPER SLOW steps away from the desk, then two timid SUPER SLOW steps back to the desk to tell me she would have to have someone take me around. I repeated to her that was fine, but that I was in a hurry, so whoever it was needed to chop-chop. She moved SUPER SLOW away from the desk again and fetched the other kid who was sulking at a desk in the corner. He came up to me and introduced himself as Kamin. I gave him my name and he said he'd need me to sign a waiver. I said fine, but it needed to be quick. He stared at me with his mouth hanging open - clearly, he has never, ever before met anyone who was in a hurry, in his young 18 years on this planet. He led me SUPER SLOWLY over to his desk and said he would have to find the waiver that I needed to sign. I mentioned that, if they were serious about getting new members and new business, they probably should have stuff like waivers just handy, right there at the front desk. He stared at me with his mouth hanging open again. Then, he asked for my name. I told him I had just given him my name when I had introduced myself, so it was nice to know he wasn't listening. He said he was trying ""to help"" me. I informed him that he was speaking to a potential member, potential new business staring him in the face right here, and THIS is how he and his sidekick were behaving? He just stared at me with his mouth hanging open again. He was probably stoned, now that I think about it. I stared back and finally said, ""Wow, you guys REALLY don't care about new business do you?"" The little skank standing at the front desk yelled at me on my way out the door, ""We don't want you here!"" I yelled back that she was an ""ASSHOLE"" and left the club. Guess who won't be getting my business in the new year!!!! You should go ahead and close this club down, LOSER management!",negative
It really makes me sick when tHesse old men walk around the men's room naked with no towel. It's really a shame. They stand on the weight scale butt naked... they use the men's urinals butt naked.... it's really gross. Have some class and wear a damn towel.,negative
"Once upon a time The Q Sports Club was the hottest and hippest gym experience in Scottsdale. You could leave your kids in daycare while you used the new Nautilus machines, took a step aerobics class, or went for a swim. When you were done you could shower and change in the large locker rooms or if you were a real baller, you could purchase entry to the separate VIP locker rooms. Unfortunately, more than 20 years and two names later this LA Fitness still feels like you are going back in time to the 1990's. Even the color scheme feels dated and although they have replaced a few pieces of equipment, you could go through a time warp wearing your Zubaz shorts, a headband and an original pair of Nike cross trainers and you wouldn't feel all that out of place. The first floor is basically deserted. There are one or two people at the front desk and I don't know that I've ever seen any one in the pool. Unlike when 24 Hour Fitness ran this facility, they don't even have a shop with supplements or equipment for sale. The space that once upon a time held a massage / chiropractor clinic is long empty and the child care are looks huge for the small number of families that use it. Oh, and the VIP locker rooms still exist, but I've never seen anyone in them. Upstairs is still a mix of treadmills, ellipticals, Nautilus and Hammer Strength machines. There's a small free weight area and 24 Hour Fitness put in a jungle-gym type machine to try and compete with crossfit gyms, but it rarely gets used. There is also a large and small group exercise rooms where they offer group classes such as BodyPump, Yoga, and Spin. A smaller room that used to be the Spin studio is now mostly used by personal trainers. For some reason the center of the floor still contains a square counter that must have originally been used by gym staff, but is now mostly just a place for women to store their purses. It seems clear that the owners don't know what to do with this location. It would probably be cheaper to tear it down and start over, but until then it seems that no one wants to put any money into it and thus it continues its decline. Luckily, if you're an LA Fitness member you have plenty of other nearby options, but if you're coming here, don't expect much.",negative
"I've been a member at this gym for a little over a year. They swore up and down they'd renovate it within six months of me beginning my membership. Not only has it not been renovated, they're no longer a 24 hour gym as of the 15th. Worst of all, they disclosed how much I pay per month to a family member. If you enjoy outdated, broken equipment, invasions of privacy, and sudden changes in hours without any advance notice, this is the gym for you.",negative
"Buddy was offered no initiation fee by clay as he walked in for his trial. He said to stop by after his workout. Buddy stopped by and a guy named chris first said clay had left for the day, and later went on to say he had actually quit (convenient). Long story short chris said he overheard the conversation between clay and my friend and never heard anything about waiving the initiation fee. We walked out, no point in wasting time with unethical people. This gym used to be ""smart gym"" so there is no basketball court and it is older and smaller. It's funny because they send me emails once a month asking me to come back and join for no initiation fee, yet they try to tell you they have no way to do it. #triggeredsnowflake",negative
"This is my favorite LA Fitness location. The people are nice and always have a smile. I got my first personal training assessment with Raine and she was fabulous. SO KNOWLEDGEABLE!!!! She knew exactly what exercises I needed to do to assist me in my fitness goals. I'm training for a triathlon, and I know how to swim, run, bike...but I don't have a clue on weights and strength training. She knew exactly what I need to do for not only building the right muscles for tri-sport, but for injury prevention. I've been down this road before, and had to stop due to injury. Her personal training skills are valuable for increasing my productivity as well as staying in the sport--essential for achieving my goals. Also, I signed up with LA Fitness through Chris, the GM. He was kind, knowledgeable and no pressure. I have a great aversion to salespeople. At no point did I feel ""sold."" I felt assisted in the process of acquiring what I wanted at a fair price.",positive
"This gym is a dump. Much of the equipment is old (very old) and shopworn. I've been told for years that this location would be remodeled or updated. Peeling paint, stained walls and flooring.

There are other LA Fitness locations around town that are fine; this ain't one of them.",negative

She is super knowledgeable and will teach you a lot about your body and how to meet your fitness goals.

"My wife and I were working out at this location, when she had to take a phone call. She stepped into a isolated area of the gym and took the call. While she was on the phone one of the trainers (named Freddy) came into the same area with a client. He looked at my wife and told her to get off her phone. As if that was not unprofessional enough, he proceed to yell ""maybe if you did not talk on the phone you would not be so heavy."" First, my wife is not heavy. Second, regardless it was extremely unprofessional and publicly embarrassing. Frankly completely unacceptable. When we complained to the font desk, the attendant had a laissez faire attitude.",negative

This gym can never open on time. If you require an early workout look elsewhere. Most LA Fitness gyms have problems opening on time but this one is especially bad. Besides that the equipment at this gym is antiquated and you frequently have to hold your breath using the bathroom.,negative

Watch out for the hard sell on the training. Overall good for your value if you just have realistically low expectations going in.",negative
"This place is very poorly maintained, has bad industrial hygiene, and in desperate need of an update. This place has an excellent opportunity to contract an antibiotic resistant staff infection. Management could care less about customer complaints, concerns or commentary. Take your money to an institution that cares about customer retention and is sanitary. The equipment hasn't changed since this place was called the ""Q"" back in the early 90's. The Cable cross-over's have been broken for 4 months. Still, no replacement or repair has been made. What a toilet!",negative
"I've been going to this LA Fitness since they purchased my membership from 24Hour Fitness. The turnover is incredible. I go about 3 times per week and see new faces weekly. The worst thing about this gym however is the Kids Club. The girl who does weekday afternoons and weekend mornings is extremely rude and unprofessional. She never greets me, never smiles, and if I try to make conversation with her she snaps at me. It's so bad that it affects my workout after being treated that way by her whenever I take my son with me.",negative
"I went in there once to ask about a gym membership and now they call me ever other day. Asked several times for them to stop calling. They say they removed it, but I keep getting phone calls.

"LA Fitness acquired this location from 24 Hour Fitness which unfortunately no longer exists in the valley. LA Fitness quickly turned this location from a 3-star gym to a 1-star gym. The men's locker room is filthy and rarely cleaned anymore. The spa, sauna, and/or pool are frequently closed for repairs. Deadlifting is no longer allowed here. The equipment is old and outdated. Sometimes the staff is friendly, most of the time they ignore you. Memberships are more expensive than when 24 Hour Fitness ran it. Time to find a new gym!",negative
"Was told in March that this LA fitness was being totally updated. They said ""the owners are picky and have high standards and they were coming to visit after the 24 HR acquisition"". This is the worst, dirtiest gym I've ever used, we have been going to the Shea gym instead which is VERY nice. I would skip on this location and wouldn't be surprised if they were closing it after a lease expires. Keeping my fingers crossed they up one of their high quality centers in North Scottsdale.",negative
This gym hasn't changed since the mid-2000s when I used to go. Signed up again and literally not one new piece of cardio. I talked to the manager and asked if they would be updating now that they're LA Fitness and he didn't know. The first day I went it was raining and there were buckets all over the place! Tacky! Cardio equipment is old and gross. Stained (big stains) all over the carpet. I feel gross every time I leave here--and not because of my workout.,negative

"Thinking of going to LA Fitness? BE YE NOT SO FOOLISH! They talked me into personal training with weekly weigh-ins, a personalized meal plan, shopping excursions to Whole Foods - the whole nine. I was pretty stoked. Until, of course my trainer no-showed for a solid month. Then the second trainer quit after one session. Then the THIRD trainer quit. Before I knew it, my pre-paid sessions had expired before I'd even been able to use them. I texted the Josh the VP, who was supposed to be ""my guy"" after the month of no-shows and my text sat unread and unanswered for 5 days. Not much of a guy. But really, not calling you back is kind of just the LA FItness way. Everyone I've talked to is like, ""gosh, that's not the experience we want"" but they sure aren't doing anything to fix it. With NO refund in sight and NO services delivered, I'm out $700. That's what I call getting swindled by business.",negative
I like this gym b/c there are less people here so it's easier to get the machines you want. Downside to the gym is the equipment is a bit used.,positive

"This one is much better than the one on Shea. Much bigger workout floor, bigger team rooms, sauna, steam room, pool, hot tub. The only thing it's missing is a basketball court.",positive
"Awful!!! I go to the one McCormick or Mcdowell usually but because the pool was inoperable wanted to see if theirs was working. I call, two rings and immediately get a man not in the best of moods ""la fitness, please hold"" like its a call center. Ok maybe they are busy. So I wait, and wait and wait, minutes go by. So I decided to call again. I hear two rings and then he places me on hold again, no greeting this time. I wait a min, nothing... I call back, he's now angry... ""You're going to have to hold!!!"" I didn't say a word and he goes directly to placing me on hold. No hello, straight to hold and now he's pissed. Great service LA Fitness, I had a simple question that could've taken you a simple ""yes"" or ""no"". I just wanted to know if the pool was open today... You've lost a long time customer...",negative
"I really enjoyed 24 hour Fitness at this location. And then it was bought by LA Fitness. In just a month it has GONE TO HELL in a hand basket. No more trainers, just sheets of paper to read at where you should be in your training cycle. Outside grass is overgrown and not maintained. Inside the showers have no soap. Then there is the ""Duh and Oh"" staff. When you tell them anything, like the showers have no soap, they look at you with wide, dumb eyes and say ""Oh"" and remain sitting on their butts, making no effort to fix the situation. There is no full time equipment maintenance guy anymore, just a maintenance groups that roves to the different locations, whenever they get there. I fear it will become a place with constantly broken down equipment like the one on Tatum. Time to start looking elsewhere. I was proud to walk in to 24 Hour Fitness. This place is really starting to feel like a dump. How sad.",negative
"My son has an LA Fitness membership in CA. He came here yesterday with his buddy to work out as we are in town for a baseball tournament. They charged us 5$ for an ""inter club exchange fee"" and tried to charge our guest 15$ to work out. We already pay 29.95 per month and for that amount should be able to go anywhere we want. We had to speak to the GM to get a guest pass after getting strong armed by a sales person for our guest to work out. Way to lose a customer LAF! Not a good look for the franchise. Will be canceling CA membership as soon as we return home.",negative
"Great gym! We've been going there for almost a year now and we love this place! They open at convenient hours, there are a lot of tools to train, weight and cardio machines, a great swimming pool, raquette ball and basketball courts! The staff is very friendly and helpful and they do a great job at keeping the place clean and enjoyable to train at.",positive
"My only qualm is their dam app. I've been trying for 3 hours to reserve a cycle for cycle class and their site never works. When I can't reserve a bike, I can't go to the class. Their web people or I.T. people need to fix simple little problems like that to make everyone else's lives a lot easier. Frustrating",negative
"Probably the worst managed national chain gym I've ever been a member of. Staff is rude and has constant turn over. Trainers have no clue what they are talking about. Thought an L4 vertebrae meant ""left side"". Gym experience: trainers leave equipment dirty and sweaty soaked with their clients for the next person, great example they set. Free weights are never put back or 1 of them is missing. Always trying to upsell you as you walk out.",negative
"I can't speak regarding all the employees, but I do want to recommend you DON'T sign up with SAM. If you sit down with one of the sales guys named SAM, ask for someone else!!! He will go back on his word multiple times and change Prices. Integrity is more important to me than anything, and LA Fitness lost my business this evening due to SAM! I don't even know how he can even be the Manager...",negative
"The hours are very inflexible. Especially considering my prime workout times are nights and weekends (hello???? They open at 8 and close at 8 Saturdays and sundays, they close at 10 pm weekdays). And about the front desk....there's this woman (girl) and she is a horrible person. She stares me down when I come in and obviously doesn't want to be there or 'work' as we call it. She makes my morning terrible with one look of her eyes. She constantly rolls her eyes at all the customers. There are no good workout classes here (hello bodypump!) There's also a ton of creepy old men. I'm canceling my membership. Why am I paying 40 per month for this crap??",negative
"Location is very convenient, biggest problem that makes it uncomfortable is the girl that works mornings on the weekends. Honestly the most unpleasant employee, she is ALWAYS on her phone, never even looks at the people walking in, she only brings up the scanner to sign in WHILE string at her phone. She doesn't acknowledge she is at work and that she is literally getting paid to use her cell phone. I don't like it because it makes me and others as well feel like she would rather us not even get near her and it makes it uncomfortable to check in. The gentleman that works evening mon-Friday is a great example of customer service always says his ""hellos, goodbyes and thank yous"".",negative
"I have been to 7 LA Fitness locations in the valley. Most are 'okay' making 3 stars. None 5 Star. This location ... doesn't even reach mediocre. I wasn't even actually in the gym yet and the front staff was extremely rude. I can't believe that I was treated with such disrespect when all I asked was ""Where is the sign in scanner?"" It amazes me that the employees are so rude and very arrogant. LA Fitness is not an inexpensive membership. You would think that the employees would be happy that they had customers. No customers ... Guess What ... No Job Fools!!!!! I will not return to this location. My search continues. Probably with another company.",negative
"The front desk staff was incredibly rude! Just went in to get an açai bowl from their Berry divine place, but front desk lady chased me down and told me I'm not allowed in there without 'checking in' which I was told differently last time I was in! I said oh sorry I was just going to get an açai bowl and she said ""well obviously they're closed today so you can't get one anyway"" I will NEVER return to this location! Completely dissatisfied",negative
"This location is one of the nicer ones. It has two storys with plenty of gym equipment and awsome bathrooms and locker rooms to accommodate your every need. But one thing this location lacks is customer service everytime I walk in every employee has their phone out and will wait to finish a phone call before they check you in. They never say hi or by or acknowledge any type of kindness you still give them.. And one more thing I can not believe happens here is, 5 minutes before they close the weight room lights turn off.. God forbid someone is lifting weights and gets the lights turned off on them.. This company is asking to be sued. Reguardless of the nice layout and abundant amount of gym equipment I won't ever recommend or return to this gym..",negative
I was very disappointed in la fitness. Wasn't clean or a friendly environment. I felt pressured when I signed up. Would not recommend,negative
"#LAFITNESS SUCKS. READ ON TO SEE WHY! Summary: LA FITNESS HAS THE INTEGRITY OF A METH DEALER. Before I moved to Thailand I contacted LA Fitness about refunding my prepaid membership because they have a policy where if you move out of the area and there are no LA Fitnesses they refund your pre paid membership fees. I've worked out at LA Fitnesses in Mesa, Gilbert, Queen Creek and the east valley. I went in person to the one on Greenfield and that's where LA Fitness intentionally makes it difficult because you have to deal with corporate. First, they do not make it easy because you have to jump through all kinds of hoops to show Corporate a new country ID, utility bills, etc and these things are not always easy to obtain especially when you move out of the country.Two months after I moved I had all the paperwork and sent LA Fitness everything needed via certified mail and over a month later they have done nothing refusing to honor the refund. Here's what I think of #LAFitness. 1) They have the integrity of a meth dealer. 2) They make it very difficult to qualify for a refund. Let's see, a one way ticket to Thailand... no gyms in Thailand... what's the issue. 3) When you do qualify and jump through all the hoops which include certified mail and an act of God they still refuse to honor their own policy. LA Fitness has nice gyms. However, a company, #LAFITNESS with no integrity that lies and refuses to honor their own contracts should be held accountable. I encourage anyone that's had a bad experience with #LAFITNESS to share their experience and give them a review on YELP and through social media. If I had known LA Fitness had zero integrity I would have gladly taken my money and business to a company/gym that did.",negative
"No matter how many times I ask, they refuse to get more 45lb plates. If anyone is working their legs it is nearly impossible to find enough free weights to do my workout. How hard could it be to get 30 more plays? They also run out of paper towels all the time.",negative
"Entering this gym was a big mistake! After talking to a salesperson for about five minutes I was so ticked off I will never return. The salesman was pushy, rude and arrogant. if they want to have clients buy memberships and stay at the gym long term they're going to have to change their ways and start treating people with respect. based on their ratings and reputation I'm obviously not the only one that feels this way. I live 5 minutes from the gym and will never go back, I'll sign up at the gym a little further just to avoid this place, not worth my money to be treated rudely.",negative
"Pros Cool pool and Ian, the trainer, was really nice. Now Cons. Jacuzzi was gross, stuff floating around in it every single time I went. My main issue: I'm enlisted in the US Navy. I needed to get in to shape before I left for basic training so I signed up to get a personal trainer. First of all, I was told that circuit training would not work for what I was trying to achieve, but what does my trainer do? Circuit training. Not only did it not work, but it made me gain fat as opposed to lose any or even keeping me where I was. I found out my ship date was going to be in the middle of January so I went in the day after the $210 was taken from my account, for my January payment, to cancel my membership. When I signed up, the manager told me that All I needed to do what bring in a copy of my orders and they would cancel it. Well, because I didn't ship out until the middle of that month, I just lost the $210. While part of my was expecting it, I then got told that I needed to scan in a copy of my orders as well as mail in the copy. I find out, over a week later, that it STILL has not been cancelled and that I need to send in another copy of my orders. These people will tell you whatever they want to get you to give them money. They are awful and I will never ever go to another LA Fitness again. What's worse, there is no corporate number to call to speak to someone above the managers of the location. So I can't just call corporate to talk to someone about my membership fee or make sure that it has been cancelled. The entire company is just the absolute worst.",negative
"If you plan on using day care for children, stay away from this gym! I was informed when signing up that they are required to have 1 adult for every 7 kids, but instead of hiring people specific for daycare, they simply take front desk people and throw them in there if needed, but they're not too good at math because coverage is still poor. Beyond that, the adults in the daycare do not monitor or attend to the children, and we had three incidents in the course of two weeks where our four-year-old twins were bullied and harassed by older children but the staff told us ""we couldn't get over there in time to stop them."" Furthermore, they were unapologetic and their lack of concern was apparent. If you have kids that need daycare while you exercise, look elsewhere, as there are more suited gyms within walking distance of this one.",negative
It has one of the coolest pool in the city. Be mindful it can get crowded and it will be closed whenever there is a water aerobic class but that is ok. The sauna is very hot so it works out great.,positive
"Pretty solid crew, solid gym! Only thing is I understand they like to keep the gym clean, but it seems like every machine I'm on is constantly getting cleaned Hard to get a solid workout in with someone in your shoulder the whole time. Other than that, awesome.",positive
"Typical gym. Overpriced and under cleaned. There are a few reasons I give it one star. They get pissed if you work out with anyone because there is no ""personal training"" (I guess talking to my brother every once in a while at the gym is personal training)........unless of course you buy it from them. The sauna only worked about half the time. The music was freaking horrible and so damn loud. ""Regulars"" (I don't know what else to call them I went enough to be called a regular I guess) would hang by the front desk and try to flirt with the late night receptionist. It was super annoying when I was trying to check in and by the look on her face most nights I'm sure it was even more annoying to her. Now the policies I paid cash in advance for a year so I wouldn't have to give them cc info but even that was a joke. I asked about a partial refund because some things in my life had changed (mostly having a daughter) and I wasn't going to the gym that much anymore. It wasn't a huge deal just something I was wondering about. I was told there are only 2 ways to get a partial refund. 1. Proof of death (I swear I'm not lying) 2. Proof you have moved to a place that doesn't have a LA fitness within 100 miles. Yea ok....well whatever. It's a gym so they are always going to try and get every dime they can. But my problem was mostly with the gym and the employees.",negative
This is the worst LA fitness gym I've been to. At least 40% of the cardio machines are either broken or due for major maintenance service! I would stay away from this gym.,negative
"I was a member here for 2 years. I canceled my membership about a year ago. It was overpriced and I would be mid run and a ""personal trainer"" would approach me to talk about his sales pitch. I really dislike stopping my run to tell them I am not interested. It got to the point that when they asked me how my fitness goals are gonig I would tell them I have lost 100 lbs so far! That shut them up real quick. Since I canceled my membership I have recieved weekly ""we want you back!"" emails that offer me a special deal of a monthly price that is MORE than what I was paying when I canceled my membership. I have called their local AND corporate offices to get myself removed from this mailing list, to no avail. Overall the facilities were nice. I was just highly disappointed in the service.",negative
Hayden Hidalgo...stop leaving your crap flyers in unwanted sections of stores. Your gym sucks and you make it almost impossible for someone to cancel their membership.,negative
"phone call: hey, do you guys have a STEAM room? ""please hold, let me check...yep we have one!"" FAIL, no they dont. but they do have a Sauna...yet, Arizona weather is a Sauna...never understood why fitness clubs put Sauna's in when its free outside. hours are not the most convenient, but arent so bad. I never get the gallery of ""managers and reps"" sitting over in the office areas, what a cost maximizer for the corporation. geez, I wonder what my monthly fee would be if they had 1 mgr/sales rep per shift, which really is all thats needed. kids club is nice, but what they want to charge you is not worth it. Those that give this place 5 stars have most likely never been to a gym before ever and have no clue what to expect. bottom line, they can do better, they just choose not to.",negative
"When I started coming to this location a couple years back I was so excited, it was never super packed like the Scottsdale location and it was really clean with fairly new equipment, I always felt comfortable there. It's slowly but surely going downhill. They haven't updated ANYTHING in this place in forever. The cardio machines are often broken. I'm a spinner and this location is still using bikes from like 6 years ago. It's impossible to find one that's in full working order. It's like musical bikes for the first 15 min of class. I will say I love the instructors for their group fitness classes here. Most all of them are awesome. If they would just update some of the equipment this place would be 5 stars in my book again.",negative
This LA Fitness is just like all other locations. Cardio kickboxing class with Andrea is awesome!!! I don't like how packed it gets during the 5-7 hour. And they hold the body fat percentage calculator hostage and make you sign up for training for it.,positive
"I go to two locations regularly and this location always has the friendliest people working, looks clean, and has a great variety of classes. It doesn't seem as closed in or dark as some of the other locations. No complaints :) The women at the front desk on the evenings I go always seems to be wiping down the doors, windows, desk etc. Which when you consider all the sweating on the machines it is nice to at least have the illusion that everything is being cleaned all the time!",positive
"My first venture to LA fitness outside my Chicago gym: same open, bright space and positive atmosphere, more diverse range of people (nice to see people with disabilities, including the man with seeping elephantiasis). Strange arrangement of the ellipticals on a floating elevated strip with not that great a view. Staff a little impersonal or icy, one I flagged down their attention to ask about towels, they directed me to the juice stand lady that was selling them. Guess I should have brought my own......",negative
"I really love going to this LA Fitness on Greenfield. Of the few LA Fitness gyms that I've been in the area it seems to be the most open, bright, and clean. It's great to have the gym divided into the different areas. Treadmills, elliptical, bikes, and stair climbers upstairs, circuit training in the ""big"" area, free weights towards the back. Just trying to give you a little visual. I feel comfortable at the gym. I'm not some massive weightlifter by any means (although my picture may deceive you... haha) but I feel like there's a really good mix of people there to make anyone feel comfortable. I've just had some issues with the administrative side of the gym. My roommate was getting charged for a while since it didn't switch over to my card when I signed up with him and I've just never felt like the staff was friendly toward me... I know it's not always their job to say ""Hi"" when I walk into the gym or as I'm leaving but when they have conversations with a lot of other people, or I almost always have to scan my card by myself just isn't the greatest. (These are really nit picky things by the way - just a few of my experiences.)",positive
"I'm a fan of this location. For the most part, the staff greet you when you walk in (the signal butte gym they didn't even look at you), it's pretty clean (I think), and it's close to home. They have a good variety of classes that give you a pretty good workout. My only complaint is that the director of the classes is ALWAYS 15 min late to teach class which is super annoying. But, even though she is never on time, she will kick your butt. I take my son to the dayacare here, and the ladies that work there are all really nice. They remember my son's name and always gives him a sticker when we leave. They seem very attentive. The body works instructor (I think her name is Jolene) is awesome!",positive
"I like going to this gym as opposed to the other LA Fitness's, because it's clean and everything is in working order. The staff are friendly and the personal trainers are approachable. I just wish the upstairs was bigger, so it could have more treadmills/ellipticals.",positive
"One of the grossest gyms I have been a member of. The bathrooms are almost never clean, smell horrible whatever time you choose to come in to workout and the management even after multiple requests refuses to take action on it. I would rather sit on a porta potty for hours than even attempt to sit in their bathrooms for more than 30 seconds. Equipment is a hit or miss, multiple machines are always out of commission. They did however add some new stair masters which are great. Being swayed into it by other friend's recommendations, I tried out their personal training services while I was a member and boy was that a waste of money. Trainers are more worried about making sure you finish before your 30 min are over rather than making sure they make the most out of it for you. Even if they are late, they will make sure you finish before your time slot is over. Even though they advertise 30 min sessions, realistically it is around 20 min. I was told while signing up for the service that I wasn't tied down to just one trainer, but when I complained about the unprofessional behavior of my trainer to the manager, no actions were taken. The trainer did get very defensive about it following which the workout sessions became progressively worse. Would not recommend this service or this gym to people looking around.",negative
"This is a well run gym at a great price point. They have a walking track, large free weight area, and 3 sets of circuit weights. The classes are better than average and included in your fee. This is a great gym for those not looking to spend a lot of time looking at themselves in the mirror.",positive
"Today this was probably the filthiest gym I have ever been in!!! Busy gym during flu season with trash overflowing, not paper towels, no hand sanitizer and a staff that didn't seem to care. They said the janitor would be in tonight, in the mean time they wouldn't have to worry about trash overflowing any more because there are no more towels to put in the trash. I do believe if the department of health were to do an inspection they would shut the place down.",negative
"You know! I would really like to give them a better review. However, after explaining to them 5. Yes, 5 times our house burned down and we won't be using our membership. I was still charged for the passed 5 months. Normally, it wouldn't be a problem. But, we live in Chardon, That's a 45 minute drive to use this gym. I called over and over again. I even came in 3 times. Yet, I was still being charged. Today was my 4th time here and they said my membership was cancelled and I wouldn't be charged anymore. What about 5 months worth of charges. AFTER I already cancelled? This is ridiculous! Just another large corporation wanted to screw over their patrens.",negative
"If you try to use a guest pass here, you will wait a long time an it may not be honored. Not a good way to encourage people to sign up.",negative
"It is a total disaster to enroll in this gym. Please google it and consider my review before you go. I am not the only person who gets into trouble with unexpected bills from this gym. The staffs there have credibility issues. They promise you everything and treat you nice until you find out they are only after your money. I got billed for over $700 for personal trainings I have never agreed or received. After I brought this to the Personal Training Director's attention and request to stop the unauthorized charges, I still get billed! So I have to call my bank to file a credit dispute. I don't know whether I will get my money back but you should not be the next victim.",negative
"At first site, this gym was great, and even until now I really want to love this gym. The positives: great layout, use of space, design and features. There is an indoor upper floor track (which is impressive), plenty of cardio areas and the gym is large enough that even during peak hours it isn't as annoying as other gyms where you just lose momentum waiting for machines to open up. I do get a little frustrated sometimes and wish they expanded the weight training area for peak hours, but comparative to other LA Fitness centers this space is glorious. Also, it's easy to find a less busy, more optimal time to go. It's impressive that they are able to fit in something for everyone there. I love me my stationary bicycling, and their little room is quiet, dimly lit and nicely isolated for when I want to just go at it without being bothered or cramped. There is a nice variety of weight machine, and plenty of rooms to do cool downs and cardio routines. The cardio machines upstairs are nicely updated. There are many negatives to this gym. First and foremost, they do not keep it clean. I can speak for the the men's locker room. I know it should expectingly carry that traditional stinky man scent you can't escape from, but the stalls and sink area are down right offensive. I've worked in plenty of restaurants and facilities enough to know that they do not even bother to use bleach, or they're not cleaning it frequently and extensively enough. It's so sickening I try to run right in and right out to wash my hands. It literally smells like urine and bacteria dried all over the floor and walls. I'm not exaggerating when I say it smells like that EVERY TIME (and I go 4-5 times/week). It's like they don't even care. Completely unsanitary. On the subject of cleanliness, there is a guy in the evening that tends to take his shirt off at the last hour and pine over his own silly bod (what a corny, narcissistic era we live in). Shirtless and sweaty, he moves from machine to machine in the weight room. Interestingly, there is cleaning staff and front desk staff helping clean up, walking right past him and no one enforces the ""keep your blouses on"" etiquette that every gym in the world has. What a great way to help transmit ring worms and MERSA to everyone. There are a couple staff members at the front desk who have great customer service and are very polite, but most of the time we are standing there waiting on the other apathetic staff members to grab our passes and scan them while they sit there and chat to each other. One staff member was even sitting there calling stores looking for a beer pong table! Not a good look for any business. I've counted up to 30 seconds as we watched two people chat it up before scanning us in. When my fiancée signed up, the man helping us told us he'd sign her up for a discounted price, but when she came in to sign up, he claimed that he overlooked it and that was for a different period. Yeah we're not stupid- the bait and switch is not something new for LA Fitness. I've had a couple experiences both here and at home in WA, with LA fitness ""sales"" reps. Each and every time they are frustrating and just trying to sales pitch you to maximize profit for the gym. The other downside is that the basketball court can bring in very loud and obnoxious people. I've never had a problem until I got here trying to keep focus during my workout. The noise and yelling is so loud from the court, that even with my music at max volume, it's still hard to focus and get in my own zone. I thought I was being ridiculous in reacting but then I realized when I looked around, that everyone was irked by the noise as they tried to continue on. Again, the staff hears the same loud noise- yet no one cares enough in that facility to do anything for the masses. This doesn't happen all the time and really just matters when you go- that's the plus side of that. This gym (locker room) is very stinky and has terrible, apathetic etiquette. We only stay because it's size, layout and I'm only here for another year for school. After that, thank goodness! It's unfortunate because like I said, I really want to like this gym. IMO it has serious potential to bring in a lot more members. If the folks that ran this place just cared about improving, rather than just hooking ppl into contracts and knowing they have their money, and looked beyond that I think they would have a gym that retained their customers and their business. I would think twice and weigh the pros and cons of this and other gyms before signing up. I'm mostly the type of person who just gets in and out and so I try to bite my tongue when it comes to the negatives. But overall, I've seen other LA fitness centers run with a better etiquette.",negative
"Poor customer service! Was not able to get the promised guest pass due to the lack of proper information. I was told, you can bring the guest anytime for two weeks. However, what I was not told about is that the guest's phone number has to be placed in system on day of signing the gym contract. Even after explaining my situation, they would not try to help me in any way. Again, poor customer service.",negative
"Terrible organization and service. I signed up less than a week ago - at the time I was told that there is no option to do a 7-day trial of the gym as advertised, unless I sign up for a membership. However, as long as I cancel within 7 days, I will not be charged. I return in 4 days to cancel my account, because the facility is just too far for me to use. I was told that I won't be refunded because I had to cancel before 3 days. I was also told that in order for me to cancel, I need to come in when the manager is here, which is during normal work hours, despite an associate telling me over the phone that anytime would work. Who can take a day off work just to cancel a membership!? When I told the front desk person that this means I may have to contact my credit card company to dispute the charge because of their service, she shrugged and said that that's what I would have to do. What kind of service and attitude is that!? They also consistently looked away and stopped paying attention to my questions even when I'm kid sentence. I would not recommend this location to anyone if you expected to be treated with common courtesy and respect.",negative
Too crowded all the time I hate it.. the staff overall is very snobby and unapproachable as well... don't like this location very much,negative
Great gym if you go during off-peak hours. Waits are long for machines and free weights in the evenings. Locker room and facilities as a whole are pretty good and membership price is very reasonable.,positive
"Been a member for at least ten years Was there this morning &observed a very dirty walk/running track. The walls & floor were filthy. Also, looked like a lot of bikes & other fitness machines were missing.",negative
"I've been a member of the gym for a few months now. I really enjoy it. Its not perfect, but thats why I gave it 4 stars. It is usually clean (Not always extremely clean, which is why I gave it 4/5 stars...sometimes I see bottles or paper towels on machines left behind by other members), it does get busy at peak hours but I avoid those. I go in the mornings and its not busy and you can always find a empty machine to use. My favorite part of this gym is the womens workout room which allows me to be more comfortable, although a few times men have walked in while giving tours which I think is inappropriate (Please let the woman tour the locker room/womens fitness room alone so no males enter it!) I also attend the group fitness classes 3-5 times a week and LOVE them. They have helped me so much and all the instructors are great. I really recommend them! Definitely check them out, its one of the better gyms in the area!",positive
"The past 2 months, I've been getting collections calls from different locations in the U.S. I paid $60 for a 5 day pass. The front desk girl said I'm late $32 and I told her I'm not a member and never was. She said that I paid for my first and last months when I ""joined"" in May (I visited my family and my cousin paid the $60 for me for the 5 days). She passed the phone to a sales rep, Matt, I believe. ( I'm an assistant manager at a national health club. I knew exactly what was going on with the temporary account.) Matt addressed the situation and agreed with what was going on and said he will call me Monday to update me that the account will be closed. He has great customer service. As for the Manager that signed me up.. He is bald and has glasses....He is a sleazy salesman.",negative
"Hey i like this one! They have a track overhead. The place is laid out very well. The staff at the front was not exactly welcoming, but not really rude. The place was really clean in the bathroom, but the machines were looking rough. There was some cups and debris left behind on the floor, so it looks like they are not vacuuming on a regular bases. But hey, it does not impact me while I am working.",negative
This a nice facility that is not well maintained. The location is very convenient. I usually do my grocery shopping in this same plaza. My workout requirements are basic. I use ellipticals and weights mainly. The classes here are what make my membership worth it. I've enjoyed yoga and zumba but have friends who speak highly of spinning and kickboxing also. I pay 30$ a month and feel the cost and amenities are fair. There's also an indoor pool and track.,negative
"I did my research on Yelp before I went and took a tour. And everything that was written on Yelp was 100% accurate....the facility is not well-maintained. Fingerprints all over the glass windows like they hadn't been wiped down in months. When the guy giving me a tour offered me the option to check out the women's locker room I took it upon myself to get some live testimonials and ask a few ladies in there what they thought of the gym. Slick, eh? One of them mentioned that the water fountain had been broken and it took the staff a few weeks to fix it. Weeks? Three ladies all gave me an, ""it's ok for the price"" response. They pointed out a locker that was hanging off the hinges, broken, and some unfinished areas in the locker room. They said stuff like that goes unaddressed for long periods of time. There were a few machines that weren't in working order. What *really* stood out to me was the fact that there were weights, mats, empty water bottles etc. laying all around the gym. So that tells me two things...the people that go to this gym don't re-rack anything (which is bad enough because it's discourteous to other gym-goers), and that the staff doesn't do anything which is worse. This is a big place and it could be SO MUCH better if they took care of it. It felt like a really run down and tired Bally's Fitness (even though I know it used to be Urban Active), and I didn't feel good when I was inside the place. I left there and drove down the road, took a tour of Lifetime Fitness, and bought a membership there. That place is the Rolls Royce of gyms in the area. So for the $35 per month LA Fitness quoted me it was a no-brainer to go to Lifetime and pay the $75 per month to go there just to be in a cleaner, newer gym where you feel good in the environment.",negative
"On Dec 29th, a friend and I went into to the brand new Cuyahoga Falls location to see if we could take a look around/get a tour. We were THOROUGHLY disrespected. We asked for a tour and the staff at the front desk staff called over some in a shirt and pants that looked like he might be management. He started asking us marketing questions, (what are you looking for, where do you work out now) and although I politely asked about 3 different ways if we could just take a look around at what they offered he WOULD NOT give us one and told us to wait there (there were only a handful of members in the gym and there were though no less than 8 staff at the desk and at the marketing tables on the left talking to each other). They just sat there and stared and ignored us until we left. We FINALLY did leave when a younger hotter person came in and asked the guy at the desk and he TOOK HER THAT INSTANT for a tour without so much as a look towards us. Even though I know first hand how shady gyms are, I'm still sort of in shock. It was clear to us the type of members they are looking to attract.",negative
"Have been working out here for a couple of years, and as far as gyms go it's pretty standard. I like the indoor track and the fact that they have child care available (although the caliber of that care is somewhat suspect). I usually go during the day so it's not too crowded, but can be pretty busy at peak times. Locker room could be cleaner. Membership fees are always negotiable, and if you pay upfront you can often get a pretty fair rate.",negative
"Star 1: Friendly staff, and always well staffed. Several PTs available also. Star 2: Great open layout, with many options for traditional and 'modern' exercises, with a decent pool. Star 3: Cardio Theater, in addition to an indoor track and a plethora of cardio machines on the first and second floor Star 4: Even at peak hours, you can still get your workouts finished without being flustered Other pluses: good juice bar, saunas, several class options, plenty of parking Minor Nays: Closes at 7pm on the weekend, and at 11pm on weekdays.",positive
"Love this location, have never had an issue here. The smoothies are good and the facility is never to crowded. I have had memberships at other gyms but ended up back at la fitness.",positive
"Despite my contempt for this corporation and management, my trainers ROCK. Those two in particular, have changed my life. I will be forever grateful and give them five stars of solid gold. Ethan and Joe are AWESOME!!!",negative
This gym has changed a lot since it first opened as Urban Active. It was much cleaner and better ran than. LA Fitness has allowed the standards to deteriorate and the cleanliness to go by the wayside. It's frustrating when there's no direction from the staff towards patrons abusing equipment or hogging machines. Additionally if something does break it can take up to 2 weeks for it to get fixed. Yes this is a big gym with lots to do but it's not worth $35 a month.,negative
"Great location, I tend to go this location more since its more spacious then the market street location. Reason for three stars is due to limits on free weights here. Other then it's great .",negative
"To start off, let me say that I've been to at least 30 LA Fitness locations around the country. This one ranks somewhere in the middle. The upside is, it's not very busy, so you can relatively easily get to the equipment you want. However, the equipment is very mixed. Some is new, while other machines are ancient. The older ones tend to break a lot, so a substantial portion of this gym is always out of service.",negative
"Oh, how I really want to love this gym. The location is great (next to a Nordstrom Rack? Yes please.) The facility looks nice and offers lots of different kinds of weight and cardio equipment. They also just opened a smoothie/health food bar, but I've never tried it. But it's still missing the mark in so many ways. This place lacks in communication, customer service, and cleanliness. First of all, the time of day you come here makes all the difference. Expect it to be a bit of a madhouse on the weekends (especially in the late morning-early afternoon hours). I have yet to take a class here because I find them to be at awkward times and the ones I've seen have been unbelievably packed. But I just figure they are so packed because they are that good. As far as the gym itself, everyone's comments about machines being broken and not fixed for a long time is totally true. Machines will be unusable for weeks, but it hasn't been an issue for me personally yet, because there is an abundance of equipment and you rarely have to wait for anything, anyways, which is really nice. Furthermore, I have to say, this is the filthiest gym I have EVER been to. I always wipe down machines before and after I use them, because as you will witness, few people do. While I usually see someone cleaning during the week in the mornings, the weekends are a different story. Hand sanitizer has often run out, trash cans are overflowing, bathrooms are gross, discarded water bottles are on the floor. As far as the staff goes, most of them are super nice. There are a few kids, however, that are usually sitting down, texting, and not even responding when you say hello as they scan your key card. Maybe I'm old school, but seriously, am I inconveniencing you? And one final note - this place needs an email list or Facebook page. I've driven here a few times only to find they have randomly closed with no warning. 2014, people!",negative
"I was mistaken when I even thought to give this place 2 stars. You can find decent equipment, a track, classes, etc at MANY other gyms. I def got ANOTHER call from personal training... seriously??? Not sure what education these guys have to be personal trainers, but they must not go over reading or understanding English. Not sure how many more ways I can say ""PLEASE don't call me. I'm NOT interested"".",negative
"The worst experience I had! Signed up for membership and visit couple of times and was schedule an orientation, instead of showing me around, the guy was pounding me for 45 min. With the fact that I have to use his services as a personal trainer. It was awful so I cancel my membership. Never again.",negative
"Pretty good pricing (month to month) and good training services. Try to catch them on a deal. Shoutout to Stephanie who trained me for half a year! She was great. I highly recommend her. They have a lot of good amenities - pool, women's only gym, fitness classes, spinning, etc. I also occasionally go here for yoga and zumba. My only issue is that for yoga, it's more ""pop"" yoga. The instructor does a great job with breathing and giving everyone space to go at their own pace, but she plays sometimes poppy music in the background, and occasionally will try to make funny comments, which makes it hard when you're trying to hold your body in a pose! It works for a lot of people, but I prefer a yoga class with more concentration.",positive
This gym is decent but I was looking for a gym that offered classes (which they do) but they are usually filled to the max and the times being offered aren't that good. I also tried to go spinning on a weekend morning and the bike I got on was broke so I had to leave and I notice that a lot of the equipment there is broken. The gym is usually crowded and there is a lot of grunting/yelling in the free weights area which is very annoying (definitely a meat head kind of gym). The one good thing about the gym is the pricing and they allow you to do month to month (I signed up when it was Urban) so not sure if this still holds to be true.,negative
"They will force you into a 2 year contract and then trick you with the cancellation fees. I moved states and the lady that signed me up KAY said if i moved states it was free but if i wanted to cancel the membership it would be $50. Here i am a year later, i moved and want to cancel it but no they won't let me!!!! Worst gym ever. Worst customer service.",negative
"I was a member here for a little under a year. The gym itself is nice & I don't have any complaints about that. The reason for the 1-star are the corporate policies and harsh contracts. In fairness they have good pricing, but to compensate they take advantage of you from various contractual standpoints, misleading sales tactics, and outright lies during cancellation. So let's talk about what led me to write this review. There is a $50 cancellation fee if you move more than 20 miles away from any LVAC. This $50 fee is uncommon and the vast majority of people will have no idea it's there until they move and cancel their membership. This is because the sales staff doesn't tell you, and most people don't read the contract. I told my at-the-time gf I would only sign up if she was the guarantor of my contract since I may have moved and I didn't want to be stuck with the $50 cancellation fee. She agreed and was the buyer of the contract. Fast forward about a year, I move, and go through the appropriate steps to cancel my membership, sending in the required docs and whatnot. They confirm with me my (former) gf is the one responsible for the fee and my membership has been cancelled. They continue calling me asking for the money and I request my phone number to be removed from their database since my membership has been cancelled and I am not legally responsible for anything. The lady agrees and says she'll delete my phone number. Fast forward a few weeks and I start receiving phone calls again which I don't answer. I then receive a letter stating my membership is NOT cancelled and I owe $43. I called today and the lady on the phone tried to tell me I was legally responsible for the $43. Fortunately, having an attorney as a father I understood the appropriate questions to ask to get her to ultimately admit I am not legally responsible for this money & my credit will not be impacted; however, the representative was convincing, and most people would have been duped into thinking they were legally responsible and would have coughed up the $43 membership fee plus the $50 cancellation fee. You can really learn a lot about a company by reading their contract. The salespeople will tell you (or NOT tell you) anything to get you to join, and that's their job, I used to be in sales. You can only trust the contract... You also learn a lot about a company when you try to cancel your membership. Unfortunately, both signing up and cancelling have been quite arduous experiences. Couple random notes: -Downgrades at ""end"" of contract have $35 fee & sometimes you won't be eligible for cheapest rates (they do this to try and force you to stay w/ higher tier pkg). Make sure to clarify renewal fees and rates before you sign. -Receive 3 months free for referrals, but they force you to go to headquarters to redeem (tactic to dissuade people from redeeming as there is no reason this can't be done from from any gym location). Plus, they outright lied. They gave the person who referred me this 3month slip but when ""I"" read the fine print it did not apply for my type of membership. After bringing this up they acknowledged she would have gone to corporate and been rejected the 3 free months, and I would have signed the contract under false information. Me reading the fine print and realizing I was lied to led to me choosing a different membership structure. -No 12 month option? Forces clients into long-term (26mo) contract. Also, no month-to-month at the end of your contract. Forces long-term contract renewal. These are tried and true business tactics to take advantage of customers who don't understand what they're doing. -Be careful. I received 3 different sets of pricing (2 of which were incorrect) from the sales staff. You really need to read the fine print and ask lots of questions. It's a lot more complex of a structure and contract than EOS or 24hr Fitness. -Compared to 24hr Fitness & EOS, the staff is by far the lowest quality. That's not to say everyone is bad, I had a few people I really liked, but in aggregate, the lowest quality between the three. Notably my issue w/ MJ & my gf had an issue w/ 2 female employees taking mirror pics when she was naked in the changing room. This issue continued even after she altered management.",negative
Been with them for almost a year now so this is overdue! Parking is plenty but it gets fill-up quickly. The facility is super clean. I like to use their sauna after a long day at work.,positive
"very mean when I made my plan three years ago, I was told that I could cancel when I wanted to. but they lied, they gave me no option to do that. They said I could not cancel. after much insisting they said they would cancel, so, without worrying, I went back to my country, Brazil. This year I went back to Vegas, I went to the gym again, this time I was able to make a three-month contract. I paid in cash $ 100. I was super happy. but to my surprise the other day when I came back to work, my plan had been canceled. I was told that I had a debt for non-cancellation of the contract. I did not get back the $ 100 I paid the day before. I am very disappointed with the gym. I DO NOT RECOMMEND ! You will never be able to get rid of it. and when you think you got them, they'll get your money making you a fool.",negative
"I got a membership here, and I cant cancel it because of the contract I signed which I have to pay for years before I can cancel for free. They told me i have to pay $500+ if I want to cancel the membership. Lesson learned, don't sign contracts from people you don't know, they'll lie whats not and what's on the contract.",negative
"This is such a long over-due review! I love LVAC and have been going here for years. My first location (pre-baby) I went to was the Central/Sandhill and although old, still got the job done extremely friendly staff, & clean. Now that I've moved near Henderson, I go to the Green Valley location and don't think I'm switching gym anytime soon! I MUST MUST MUST rave about the playroom now that I have a daughter. Norah has been going to the Playroom since she was 8 months old (now 2!) and they are nothing less than AMAZING. They remember her by name and she gets so excited once we pull up to the gym (forgive me for not knowing staff names - I should ask!) I usually going around 6PM and the same staff is there. Now that it's the new year EVERY gym is bound to be crowded so don't let other reviews fool you. Love the staff. Love the gym. Period.",positive
"I've been looking for a gym close to my house, as I didn't want to drive all the way to my office where my current gym is located. I signed up for a free 1-day pass to check this place out as many people I know go to LVAC, and they seemed to enjoy it. The front desk girl looked like she was ready for work, but I felt like I was interacting with someone who didn't entirely comprehend what I was asking. She mumbled most of the time, and kind of trailed off, leaving me sort of confused as to whether I should repeat what I said or just get someone else who had a brain. The guy who was helping us fill out the form acted like ""sign up if you want, or don't -- Just don't waste my time."" When I started to work out, some machines were broken and archaic. Towels weren't readily available, and everyone in the gym must have been trained to stare at people with contemtment who didn't have mr. Olympia-status muscle-bound physique or 34D-sized boobs. From the person cleaning the floors to the trainers all the way to the lackluster front desk girl, I wasnt feeling all that welcomed. Then they hit me with a 26 month contract. When I said I don't want a contract that long, the staff just plainly stated, ""it's only 50 bucks to cancel though."" When I replied, ""it's still 50 bucks though,"" he didn't say anything, and he didn't say anything either when I told him, ""thank you, and have a good day."" I can deal with less-than-stellar equipment. I won't deal with rude staff. And I didn't meet a single one today who was decently nice. Won't be going ever again.",negative
No complaints I like the classes they offer... 8 Strikes and RPM Cycle are my favorites. Just wish they offered more on the weekends.,positive
I love my gym! I have been working out here since I moved to Las Vegas in 2007. Going on 9 years soon. I have nothing but good experiences here. I shall be working out here for another 9! ;),positive

No more spit balls or nasty toilets or smells of sweat and funk or Brown Pools or Spa. Because of Joey as Manager, it's like working out in Beverly Hills at a Five Star Resort.

"Its good big gym. Has everything you need to work on your fitness. There is a pool and indoor track too. The only thing is parking sucks and at any given time of the day its always busy. This gym is always packed and at least once everyday i have to wait for a machine which i hate because Im a person of routine. There's like over 100 classes too, so if thats your thing then this is the gym for you. There's also a small Women's Only gym downstairs that has most things you need.",positive
"Bought a three year membership. Not a great gym but I I paid for three years. Joined the VIP locker section. After my 2 years of VIP locker I had knee surgery during renewal time of locker. No call, no notice just put my my personal items in a plastic bag. The area manager Bill apologized to me. I renewed my locker and got my stuff back. About three months late about $200 stolen from me out of my locked locker. Two weeks later another $40. I'm fortunate enough it didn't hurt me but no fun. Bill seemed to fix the problem by changing locks and access to VIP. Renewed my membership that expired and at that time switched from premium to standard. I have VIP access I didn't need premium. On invoice told them to change membership to standard and authorized to cc to be charged each month. After 7 months of over billing called to get straight with them the told me you're switching memberships we have to charge you more and a sign up fee. Are you joking? I cancelled my membership today effective June 30, 2015. Don't go to this gym unless you want to be treated like trash, stolen from, and ripped off by them. I hope my post saves one person from the mystery of joining LVAC.",negative
I'm an avid gym enthusiast. I go.5-6 times a week. I got the pleasure of visiting this place with a member not too long ago who swore by this place. She Loved this place. Then she took me ....member services did not want to honor there own promos and made us both jump through hoops and was plain rude. Which is fine. One star for rudeness G. If I could get over that if rate them a lot higher for the gym itself. Large facility with a lot of equipment. I'm assuming to their low pricing (good thing) that explains how insanely busy it was during what I would consider a non peak hour being from another part of the country.,negative
"I have attempted to cancel my membership over the last 5 months as I haven't set foot in LVAC. I noticed a $20 charge in addition to my monthly membership. When I called LVAC, they stated that this was an insufficient funds charge. I reviewed my bank account and called to confirm this was not true. I had plenty of funds and payment was processed at the initial request. LVAC did not call me to say I didn't have funds, but expected customer service out of the biggest scam gym in town was expected. I plan on using this to cancel the membership before the two year expiration. The fine print at this place is as fungal as the nasty overcrowded locker room! Don't go here!",negative
"This is the worst gym ever, their customer service sucks!! They try to lock you in for 2 years, they lie, and they're management at corporate is very unprofessional DO NOT sign up here ever. Tru fusion is right down the street and they are absolutely amazing",negative
One of the two LVAC's I go to and this one is the better of the two. It's location can be a problem at times as traffic is backed up certain times during the day. This gym is usually crowded so parking can be equally as fun as fighting traffic. The equipment is up to date and they always get the newer machine to exercise on.they have two classrooms that offer many different classes for your pleasure or pain! The pool and hot tub is a decent size and usually has enough room. The sauna and steam room also a larger than other locations and these are popular spots on members visits. The club is clean and staff is friendly.,positive
"Steer clear... signed contract 2+ years ago and still getting charged once expired 9 months ago! No refund, and no apology of any kind! Apparently you sign up for life! Go month to month or don't go! There are better clubs in town! No stars if that was an option!",negative
"I was very disappointed today, I brought my wife along for a tour the facility and possibly her becoming a member. The sales representative gave her the tour was really lack and didn't give her the full details of the facility. It seemed like we were bothering him for the tour, it seemed like a real good opportunity to sign my wife up today turned out to be dismal as she is did not sign up thank you for your poor representation by your sales staff. I would like to suggest that your manager AJ is retrained on how his customer service skills are delivered to your current and future customers.",negative
"Not happy with this this gym or the customer service at all!!! Found out two months after processed payments, that even though the payments went thru on my credit card, they were considered late. Now I owe $50.... Where were the phone calls or emails (some sort of communication) the first time a payment was ""late"" I think they do shady things like this on purpose to get even more money. Like I told them, if I had known there was a problem, I would have taken care off it two months ago!!! It's a $20 membership, not worth this! Plenty of other gyms with out the run around and non communication.",negative
"Bottom line: Oversold and unmaintained. This is the 4 gym I have been a member of (I move a lot). It is by far the worst. All of the problems stem from the same cause. They never stop selling memberships. I have been this gym at 10 pm on a Saturday and its full. I have regularly driven around for so long lot looking for parking that i gave up and went home. You regularly have to wait for machines. Many classes are so full you can barely move around. I have gone for spin class and had to leave because there wasn't room for another bike. Despite the high demand for classes they haven't added any more. It is a high use gym and it doesn't seem like it is ever cleaned. The entire place reeks. I assume that their staff are underpaid because they are all rude a-holes. Basically, it seems like the owners of LVAC are trying to squeeze every penny they can out of their gyms.",negative
"One of my favorite places to be. Except during Zumba of course! I started recently coming back here to work out and get back into shape. For the most part they have avoided me about the free months I was suppose to get with signing my friends up, but whatever thats a thing I hate about this place. I did though get a year for $144 so its not too bad. I've checked out most of the gyms around my area and out of all of them, this one just simply has me most to offer me, seeing as I like running on a track and not a treadmill.",positive
"Giving it 1 star only because the staff left a bad taste in my mouth. I don't remember the guys name that I dealt with, but he was over pressuring me to sign up & was not professional. Plus its always over crowded, so for me its worth driving 15 min to Edge Fitness off Blue Diamond. Their staff is extremely friendly, & I train 3 times a week for the past 3 months & have never had a problem. This location is only 4 minutes from my home, so if the staff treated me & my girl friend more professionally, than I would've signed up since my brother & friends work out here too.",negative
"This is my new location, since I moved. I much prefer the location on rainbow & vegas dr. I haven't been to any classes yet here. but I will be trying soon. the womens only area could use some work... they have a good amount of cardio machines. and seems to always be busy. lots of parking, but always busy so might not always find a spot too easy. I will be updating this after the next time I go and see more of the location.",positive
"can those TV ads and that website be any more annoying? They market to ADD sufferers. Awful techno music on the TV just blares up when it plays (virtually useless - non informative TV ad) and their website has those annoying ""live interactive"" salespeople that tries to talk to you and you can't find any relevant info on your own. Good luck finding the monthly fees on the website. I gave up. Not worth the hassle. EDIT- good deal on membership once I showed up. I feel like an ass now since I wrote bad review. This place is pretty good compared to the local 24 Hour.. Cheap too.",positive
"I was a member here for six months. It's a decent club but there are entirely too many people. At 5 pm, I expect a gym to be packed. But 5 am? Parking is terrible here.

"Great gym at a great price. Open 24 hours a day every day. Lots of classes all day every day. Can get pretty busy. Nice indoor running track and the kids area is fun for the kids. Alot of people complain about the people who go but honestly, if you are going to work out, who cares what other people are there.",positive
"It seems funny giving a so so review to a business I go to 6 days a week. This is one of those situations where you make lemonade out of lemons. I got a great deal for pre-paying for a 3 year membership. It is close to home and my workout partner was already a long time member. Don't get me wrong, the place isn't awful. It is just very heavily used. Machines are starting to show their age a little and they are not super fast on updating them. First 3 months of the year are the worst because all the ""resolution fatties"" hog up valuable gym space. My only other HUGE peeve is their cleaning crew is scheduled for 9AM every day. Really? Prime time is when you have to mop at a 24HR gym? How about 3am? That would make more sense. Until this city get s a nice high end option like Sportsclub LA or Reebok Club, it will have to do.",negative
"I originally liked the idea of a large athletic club, until I started having to deal with the management of this chain. Here are a couple of examples: 1. They gave me a membership number that was the duplicate of someone else's number. After I called and cleared up the matter with their corporate office (nobody at the gym itself is empowered to do anything) I attempted to go back to the gym. When I arrived they wouldn't let me in. I calmly explained that I had just talked to corporate and my bills had been paid on time, every time directly from my bank acct. 1 hour later (and 45 minutes more on my cell phone, since they wouldn't let me use a house line) we finally got the matter cleared up. Unfortunately I could no longer workout since they had wasted all of my allotted time. All of this, and not a single apology or offer of compensation 2. They decided to close their child care at 2 pm three days after a holiday without advertising or announcing that they would be doing this. When I arrived to drop off my kids they just said ""tough luck, what do you want me to do about it?"". Other: As expected the personal trainers have completed their mail-in certification program, but are hard pressed to figure out that folks workout for many different reasons. Their expertise is sorely lacking and the free session was completely unproductive. The one spin class I attended started off with a 35 minute ""endurance ride"" (i.e. ride the bike at a normal pace) then we stood up for 5 minutes and concluded with a cool down. Not exactly the ""Spin Class"" I was looking forward to attending. On the bright side, I've rarely had trouble finding equipment to use and there have been very few instances of broken equipment that isn't fixed quickly. The location is convenient and their 24 hour schedule is helpful for busy folks. The gym has a lot of potential but the staff and management seems to not be focused on their customer base.",negative
"Good luck trying to cancel your membership. I fax over information and strangely enough they didn't receive anything. And even when they do get your inform, if you moved out of state they will charge you for a couple months anyway. And if you get a new debit card and have a long distance number they will not call you to inform you that you bill is building up. All a sudden your 2 states away and collections is calling you for $700 dollars. Thanks LVAC for not spending 4 cents on a long distance phone to inform me of anything!",negative
"Rob is the best trainer in Las Vegas! I look forward to working out now. Each workout is customized and tailored to my current fitness or strength level. Even if I sustain minor injuries while playing sports, my workouts are modified to not only work through those injuries but to allow them to heal without losing fitness or strength in the process. I cannot imagine having anyone else as my personal trainer. Try him out. You will not be disappointed.",positive
"I've been going here for years and love this place. Rob takes his time to understand your fitness goals and helps you achieve results. I've been to numerous gyms that do group fitness and never felt like I received any attention or had someone to be able to show me alternate moves if I couldn't do something... not here. The focus is to ensure you don't get injured which is key if you want to have sustaining results. Wether you try the Body Pump class, personal training or group training... you should try it.",positive
"LVSP has been the only gym I'll work out at for almost four years! I started coming to this gym after a few years of not being very active. My back hurt and my hips made a popping noise when I did certain exercises and Rob fixed all of that! LVSP isn't your average gym, it's really about changing your lifestyle. My workouts are 100% tailored to what shape I'm in and how my body functions and I always see results when I put the work in! I got into the best shape of my life before my wedding with Rob and currently am working on regaining strength and physique after my first baby! I wouldn't go anywhere else, I love this place!",positive
Robbie Martinez has given me back my mobility. Four years ago when I started with him I hobbled in with a cane. I've had 11 surgeries and will be 70 in December and my improvement makes me grateful everyday. I have a individualized program that Rob constantly tweaks to challenge me weekly. He had me quickly off my cane and I am still advancing. In spite of the different ages and levels of fitness even some world class athletes he gives me 100% devotion. Check him out it works!!,positive
Rob is the best. I haven't been here for long and already see more improvement in my body and it's ability than I've seen doing anything else. Definitely try it out! If you don't have excuses not to work out that is.,positive
"I first came to LVSP for a bike fitting after hurting my achilles tendon on a ride, I wished I had come here first instead of trying 2 other locations to get a proper fit. A couple of years later I am still riding with the position Greg set me up with and with no problems/pain. Last Summer I started to come here for the group training classes. I have been to a few other gyms with personal trainers and they don't even come close to what Greg and Rob have to offer. They start you out with a functional mobility test to determine your strengths and weaknesses and create a plan designed specifically for you. The group training is pretty much a semi private session with either Greg or Rob, class sizes max out at 6. During the class they are constantly watching everyone to make sure they are using proper form and determining if your routine needs changes. Unlike other trainers I have had in the past who try to push you too hard right out the gate, Greg and Rob slowly work your weight up to avoid injury. I also did classes in the cycling studio. It is a nice setup and between the group workouts and cycling studio I was able to ride further more comfortably, which to me was more important that going faster, although I was getting a little faster. If I still lived in Las Vegas I would be going to LVSP, I have yet to find a gym that can come close to what they offered. Instead I talked to Greg one afternoon about what weight kettlebells I was using and exercises so I could continue what I was doing there at home. Not quite the same, but better than some of the places I have seen around my new area. If you are looking for a great place to work out and get in shape in Las Vegas, this is the place to go. Their facility is spotless and the equipment is in top shape.",positive
"I'm very hesitant to offer such a dismal rating, as I'm more inclined in life to find something praiseworthy. In light of the poor rating, I feel it's incumbent upon myself to thoroughly explain to the reader and, perhaps, even the trainer, why I have come to this conclusion. My Daughter has been racing XC mountain biking for the last year. I'm an avid mountain biker, but hardly knowledgeable about racing, training and the detailed philosophy and mechanics of the sport. Through a search on Google, I was delighted to find Greg and his facility. I read some articles he'd written, heard him interviewed on a Podcast and thought the facility on the website looked outstanding. I couldn't wait to get my Daughter started. We sat down with Greg and I was convinced I hit a home run. Greg, aside from being a certified 'bike fitter', is a former racer (both Mtn and road), and clearly understands the sport and the art of mountain biking. He gave us a lesson on the physics, biomechanics, Psychology and theory of racing. I couldn't have been more thrilled. We talked about the advantages of having a local trainer, as I had previously dabbled with an online service. So far, so good. Greg set up my Daughter's training program which consisted entirely of different types of riding on the trails. This all made a lot of sense and I loved the focus and direction it gave us. However, a pattern was starting to develop. The first thing I noticed was that beautiful facility we saw was never utilized. When I enquired as to why, I was told that during her race season, it was not a good idea to start any kind of weight training. This made sense and so I thought when the season was up, maybe we'd be spending some time there. I would be patient and listen to the expert. Another expectation I had, was that he would actually get on the trail with my Daughter and work with her. Well, the first attempt at that and I was told the day of the ride that his bike was out of order and we'd have to re-schedule. Fine. The second attempt to ride was canceled due to the heat. I found that unpersuasive, as riding in the heat in Vegas is commonplace. When we finally did manage to get together, he was very instructive, knowledgeable and the experience made me very happy. So, you can see, I don't for a second question Greg's knowledge. Something else started to develop. The lines of communication became very difficult. Greg made it clear he wanted to use email. However, it seemed he only meant one way. Meaning, when I would email him, I'd get no response. Additionally, it seemed reasonable to me that I could attempt to get him at his facility. So, I would periodically call there when email didn't suffice. He was often with a customer, of course, which, I completely understand. I think that leaving a message for him to contact me was well within normal business/client relationship practices. My Daughter would have a race every other week. It would seem reasonable that we could expect him to reach out to discuss strategy etc. Except for one occasion, this did not occur. You start to get the feeling that we were just not that important. Today, Oct. 27th I called, with excitement, to tell Greg about my Daughter's results in Sunday's race (As still... no email). I got the receptionist who said ""Greg was available"", only to come back to the phone and say he was busy. So, I simply left a message for him to call. I had done that a few times the previous month, only to be disappointed in not getting reply. I attempted one more time today, the 27th and again was told by the receptionist ""he is available"". Now... here is where some weirdness begins, and I may have been the cause. I responded to her... ""are you sure he's 'available' or do you mean you're going to check?"". She came back and said he was not in the facility. And here's the closer... I get a call from Greg saying he speaks ""flat out' and wants to end the service. He assured my that my child has a great future, but he will not put up with me being 'rude' to his staff. He also scolded me about how he communicates through email. But, here's the kicker... and this is what bothers me the most, is unforgivable and the reason I'm writing this critique. He said ""I've asked around town about you and see that this is a pattern"". Ooh. That was fighting words and completely below the belt. Because, that is meant to be painful. It's unknowable or provable to me. It's not relevant and not believable. But, it was meant to sting. Didn't he know I'm a New Yorker. I'm not gonna put up with that. Anyway, I was taken by surprise. I literally didn't see that coming and, admittedly, I'm a little pissed right now and might decide to take this down eventually if I remember. The guy has knowledge, I'm just not sure he's 'all there' and certainly doesn't believe in good communication or discussion. So.. there you have it. I wish him the best. I truly do. Just a little pissed about that ""I've asked around...."" comment.",negative
"What a great workout! This place may be geared towards athletes but the team could not have been friendlier or more helpful during our drop in to the Body Burn class on a Saturday morning. If you are lucky enough to live in Vegas and try this place, you'll be hooked. If you are just visiting like me, drop in and enjoy a customized workout at a very reasonable price (my class was just $20).",positive
"This gym has provided me with the best experience I've ever had in the world of fitness. The trainers are attentive and innovative. My fitness level is constantly being evaluated and the training program evolving with me as I do. The equipment is top notch and the environment is the opposite of the big box gym....nobody taking selfies in the mirror or oiling their body or looking like they're about to hit the club, everybody is there to work and get fit!",positive
"I've been coming to this gym for about 3-4 years now and I LOVE IT! I'm a loyal lifetime member that doesn't cause trouble and doesn't mind following the rules but recently there's been a new rule change about wearing your shoes in the sauna. I think that is utterly disgusting and unsanitary to make people take of their shoes when hundreds of sweaty people and feet walk in their! I think that rule should not be enforced and should be taken off immediately since there is a lady manager at night that is a nazi about it. I understand they're trying to keep it clean but for 1) we PAY 60 dollars a month for them to work so they should be able to clean it. 2) if hundreds of people go in their a day and they don't clean it at night cause they think it's ""clean"" cause we have our shoes on I'm pretty sure disease and nasty stuff is going to start spreading. I hope someone reaches out and fixes this problem immediately, thank you .",negative
"WATCH YOUR BANK ACCOUNT!!!!! I just noticed I was charged $69 fee for a membership that was canceled in October (last payment was in Nov). I just called and talked to Olga, I explained that I was changed $69 today and my membership was canceled. I have not been charged since Nov (last payment). She asked if I canceled or put it on hold. I told her I canceled completely, like forever! She asked if I came in to the gym to do it (yes I was told that was the only way) and she asked if I was given a cancellation form. I DID but don't now 6 months later!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! She put me back on hold and came back and said that she sent an email to her managers Nancy and Patrick and that I would get refunded 3-5 days. This is sum shady sh*t. I wonder how many other people they do this to. I guess I need to cancel my freaking bank account so this company doesn't charge my card whenever they feel like it. I will update this post in 5 days (or less) if I see the $69 in my account.",negative
I basically use this membership for the kids swim lessons. I truly wish I didn't have to pay for membership to enroll my kids in swimming but that's the deal. Also wish there were more class time options. I've been very happy with the swim staff especially Noah who has been awesome with my kiddos. We previously attended Hubbard at the recommendation of friends however my kids learned 3x as much Ian's did more in one month that they did in 3 months of biweekly lessons at Hubbard! So glad we found lifetime for lessons.,positive
"Life spa is the worst place to get a massage. I got one a few days ago and have been in pain ever since to where it hurts to breathe. First, they try to cheat me from my hour massage by doing ""neurokinetic"" therapy which I was not informed will be part of the massage. Just stay away! It's expensive and causes pain!",negative
"This place is ridiculously overpriced, we paid for a member ship for 2 years and barely went. So I went in and cancelled my membership and now they have me in collections saying I never cancelled it, now 4 months later of me calling them every time a collections agent called me saying it was put on hold not cancelled they are saying the amount for the hold is less then the early cancellation so I should just pay it. Wtf! That is not good business practice! They should have notified me at the time of cancellation any charges dues which they didn't, nor did I ever get any bills, just a collections agent calling me every month saying we owed, $10, then $20, then $30 now $40 and each time I reiterated that was had cancelled and not put on hold, they said it didn't matter and I owed them money now. I finally just paid the $40 and will never recommend this place to anyone.",negative
I brought my son to swim today even though I'm not feeling very well I have high blood pressure but I wanted to get him out the house to swim for at least 30 minutes in the indoor pool as my son is swimming in the shallow water I'm approached by lifeguard telling me that I need to be in the pool with my son in the shallow waters then his manager comes out she tells me the same thing so I move closer to the pool so that I can be close to my son they asked us to get out of the pool because I refuse to get in the water today because I'm not feeling well mind you we have been coming here for the last 2 to 4 months I've never gotten in the pool with my son and now all of a sudden today it's a problem I will be canceling my membership I paid $122 a month not to be harassed by Life Time staff when they're having a bad day I would not recommend anyone that just want to come and relax with their children to lifetime in Goodyear Arizona I have referred several people and their families to this gym I will be making a complaint to the general manager tomorrow and I will be telling the families and friends that I've referred here the issues and let them decide if they would like to keep coming which I don't think they would it's not a family-friendly place they will harass you if you are of other color yes I said it lifetime is a races place,negative
I've been a member since 2010 and I must say the last couple of years have been the best. Overall I love my gym. The management and staff are very attentive to the members needs and request. There is an overwhelming amount of support for your wellness needs. Love the Life Spa and Cafe. My only disappointment is the cardio equipments cleanliness late at night. After being used all day by the time I get there it's in need of some major sanitizing.,positive
"DO NOT JOIN THIS GYM DO NOT SIGN A CONTRACT..... i have had a membership for 4 months. Been paying 110 for me my girl and my son. Today my girl took my son as she has in the past already and all of a sudden hes not registered and we have to pay an additional 13 dollars a month to have him have child care. The gym is good and ammenities are good but they lie and decieve to get you to sign up. Ive left 2 messages for manangers and have recieved no call back. I hate being lied too.... 13 dollars in the grand scheme is nothing but i personally do not do business with dishonest businesses. I have a year contract and they got me for another 8 months after which i will ABSOLUTELY be leaving this gym. Very dissapointed in the way ive been treated and i DO NOT RECCOMEND YOU SIGN UP HERE. you mean squat to them once they sign your contract. Do month to month or better yet go to a different gym. Once they got your bank info and your contract, your dead to them apparently.",negative
This place gets five stars where ever I go. You get so much more than a gym membership when joining Life Time Fitness. The place is always clean. Ample space for any kind of workout you want to do. The extra programs and classes they offer are great as well. This is gym of all gyms. Family friendly and positive atmosphere. You really get what you pay for.,positive
"Canceled after 7 days of trying it out. Didn't notice they where still charging me after two months of canceling. I went to talk to the manager and they told me I was going to see a refund and my account will be closed. It has been a month and a half now and still no refund. To top it off I'm still getting emails stating that my account is pass due. I was expecting organization from a $60/month gym. Keep this in mind just incase you want to ""try it out""",negative
"This is an amazing place. My kids love to come play in the pool during the summer. I work out 3 times a week and the equipment is always clean and in good repair. Other than the hot tubs being closed too often, it is a great place to get fit. Thestaff is friendly and helpful. Only complaint is that it is a little pricey and they should allow you to brieng a guest a little more often.",positive
"Just another big, scummy fitness corporation that will keep billing your card long after you've canceled, and refuse to refund fraudulent charges. Don't sign up unless you're ready to be a member until death, or until you're ready to file a fraud claim with VISA, because that's what it'll take to get out of here.",negative
Even though this gym is more expensive I do like it and my kids enjoy it I do wish they had fitness program for the kids for free rather than paying another additional price. My youngest has a bit of difficulty but I think it's because he's used to a preschool setting where they sing and dance well here it feels more like a babysitting position. I have my oldest so he tends to give his brother the attention and it works out. I love the classes especially Wednesday night Zumba step and is my favorite and I just enrolled for the 60 day challenge and I'm excited to see how that goes.,positive
"I signed up on the 6th of oct and was also signed up for the 60 day challenge. The trained told me then if I signed up with him he would train me for an hour each session and that he would credit my lt bucks toward my first personal training bill. He talked up this big game and said he could work around my work schedule. The first few sessions were alright and I was content. It wasn't until my 4th session that I realized I wasn't getting my full hour. When I asked him about it he said I was only paying for 30 minute sessions, completely disregarding his ""promise"" when we met. Go figure. In order to work around his schedule I had to go to the gym at 830 pm, after working, leaving me no time to get anything done. I told him I needed to do earlier sessions and he said he was going to sign me up with someone new who could meet me earlier and that he would call or text me with info. Nothing happened for 2 days so I called him again and he said that he was still going to train me and I'd just have to work with his hours. For he last 9 days I haven't received any messages or calls back from him so I called the gym after the 5th day to try and cancel my personal training contract and the trainer I talked to told me I had to talk to my specific trainer because he couldn't access my file. I called back the next day after I realized I had already been billed for the next month $328! He told me I would be billed monthly from the day I signed up which was the 6th. So not only did I only get 4 of 8 sessions for my first month but now I was already charged for the next month before I could cancel. The female trainer I talked to apparently could ""access"" my file and told me she would cancel my contract and email her manager and that her manager would contact me and refund my $328 and actually use my lt bucks toward my first month like my trainer said he was going to do in the first place. 3 days later, today, I get a call from another personal trainer seeming like he wanted to help and offered to refund me my lt bucks but could not refund my $328 because I didn't do a written statement to cancel. Not only was I not aware that I needed to do this but I was told something completely different when I signed up. I tried to call and cancel in time and couldn't even talk to my personal trainer. When I talked to another one he couldn't help. And the next one... apparently I was too late. Now I'm awaiting a call from the General manager which seems doubtful by now. I enjoy going to this gym but I feel really ripped off over the ""personal training aspect. The kicker is that the personal trainer I was training with got fired on Saturday and I didn't even know this. I guess they didn't plan on notifying my girlfriend or her mother who also trained with him. They were just supposed to keep calling and texting and getting nothing back. I really hope someone calls me to fix this or I'll have to just cancel the gym all together and dispute the charges with my bank.",negative
"I went for a tour and loved the facility, beautiful, huge and smelled great. However when I took my kid to childcare (he was in sandals) he was told he couldn't play in the maze because he didn't have socks, that's fine but they left it there... They didn't redirect him to other toys or the iPads. They let a 3 year old sit there staring at other kids playing for 45 mins being oh so sad. I'm also not sure the adult/children ratio is within legal standards. There was maybe 60 kids and 4-5 adults. Childcare is most important to me, and I won't be signing up because of this incident.",negative
"Lifetime fitness is a solid place to lift, swim, run, etc. However, once you sign up its almost as if no one cares about you. I had tried to ""suspend"" my membership for the month of january as i was going to be gone. I emailed 3 different times to the employee who signed me up and not one response. I have no idea why I was never responded to. So then I called the place and talked to the manager who assured me things would be taken care of which they were not. Called again and in my profile there was no written information on me calling before and no information on the emails I had sent. Have full proof of emails and calls. Its pretty pathetic customer service and all they care about is making money. The overall gym is great but the customer service is something to definitely question prior to signing up. Be aware that is all.",negative
"Life Time is the most impressive gym facility I've ever seen. There are more pieces of equipment, classes, rooms, classes, training, and other amenities than you'll probably ever use. And honestly, the price isn't bad either. (If you're a veteran or have certain BC/BS policies, they waive whatever the initial sign up fees are as well.) I rarely see any broken equipment, which is impressive given the sheer number of machines. The staff is helpful and isn't always trying to upsell you, which I appreciate. I primarily joined for the pool(s), so I could swim year-round, but I've found myself appreciating a lot of other things that Life Time offers.",positive
The gym equipment is on point ... But when I took one of the classes the yoga mats smell ! I don't think they wash them.... The class was great though DONT ever go to the juice/smoothie bar ... They are SO slow .. Like a bunch of big ass buffoons trying to figure how to make an almond spinach smoothie ... How long does that take 20 minutes + and there was NOONE before me !!!!!!!!!! All you have to do is throw almond milk and throw spinach and pour into a cup .. It takes less than a minute .. Anyways I ended up canceling and got a refund but wasted 20 minutes waiting and I looked over the counter they just started blending it like WtF! Totally incompetent The guy did even say sorry for the wait or anything he was just like oh yeah refund okay durrr stupid gorilla,negative
Very good gym. I am a big fan of group classes and have stayed a member because of these classes. I tend to stick to classes Amy teaches since she is super motivating and fun!! Also enjoy the hot yoga classes. What is keeping me from a 5-star rating 1) the membership prices are quite steep and 2) the classes tend to get really crowded and require you to get there 30 mins prior to get a decent spot. Wish they would add additional classes to the schedule. Especially evening classes. 3) there are a ton of kids which makes it hard to go to the pools.,positive

Great gym, a little pricey compared to other gyms, but well worth the money (IF you go consistently).",positive

Lifetime IS as good as it gets! I love my gym! The staff is extremely friendly and the class instructors are great! I am a yoga fanatic and they offer multiple classes throughout the day which is really nice. I take yoga 5-6 times a week here and love it! The locker rooms are extremely clean; the entire club is very clean. I really enjoy working out here and refuse to work out anywhere else... I'm addicted!,positive
"Not a good experience here at all. Do not use spa, no bathrooms, had to go to the family bathroom in my robe, inexperienced masseuse. Signed up for a trainer session and it was nothing but a sales pitch. Pool closed a lot, hair in showers and not clean. A complete joke, not a gym......more like a sleazy car dealership. I contacted management several times and no response!",negative
"I'm sorry for those that have had bad experiences at Goodyear Lifetime; however I can't say the same quite yet. So far all couldn't be better- exept for two things. Eric who signed me up, did an awesome job in presenting in everything. The gym is always clean,super clean towels, always find an available clean working machine, never overcrowded, plenty of classes offered to just join for no separate fees. I initially met with a PT which didn't work out for me- so I chancged to meet with Charles and Annie, they both are awesome people to work with. Not superficial at all, easy going, encouraging, no pressure sales. My two setbacks are that I wish there were better massage chairs at the spa place- those chairs that they currently have SUCK major, it's a joke of an annoyig massage. And I wish they would supervise the kids more and separate the little kids from the big kids, all that running around and comingling of big and little kids- is just asking for an injury. I doubt that i would drop off my little ones with them just for that reason. Otherwise this is a great gym- if i could I would spend half my day there - it's an awesome place to join. It resembles a country club a top notch one.",positive
"Fees and inclusions: Yes, this gym is kind of expensive- $52/month for a single membership, $100/ month for a couple. If you only want to run on a treadmill or lift weights, this might be overkill. For those who like classes and want some luxury options (eucalyptus steam room, anyone?), the price is very reasonable. Membership includes access to any class (except for the ones that use the reformer pilates machines) from spinning to hot yoga to core. It includes access to both the indoor and outdoor pools, the saunas, and steam rooms. And an insanely huge cardio area and a very nice selection of weight machines and free weights. Classes and instructors: If you enjoy classes, $52 is a steal. Being a yoga fanatic, I feel like I am in heaven. There are 2-3 yoga classes EVERY DAY, with hot yoga at least once a day. Go price what it would cost to do yoga every day (or even 5 classes a week) at a local yoga studio. The way I see it, I am getting a steal on yoga classes and everything else is just a bonus. All of the instructors at Lifetime are fantastic. Speaking about yoga, specifically, these are the best yoga instructors I have ever had the joy of taking classes from in my life. The instructors in general are friendly, welcoming, and know what they are talking about. I've taken the gamut of classes and have interacted with over a dozen instructors, and have never had anything other than friendly, pleasant experiences. I've also never had to get a ticket to go to a class, so maybe that's just a Zumba thing? Someone mentioned Randy, specifically. I have taken classes with him and never picked up on anything rude, arrogant, or ass-like. Equipment: You won't wait in line here for a cardio machine, whether you are wanting a treadmill, elliptical, or stair machine. When I enrolled, my member service guy told me to come to his office if I ever had to wait in line and he would make sure that I was refunded for that month.A few weight machines have duplicates, but there is a chance you might have to wait if you are wanting a specific weight machine and are there at a busy time. I go several times each week, and any time a machine has ever been out of order, it is fixed within a couple days. Personal training: When I signed up, there was a special for 3 free personal training sessions with your membership. Unlike others who experienced a high-pressure sales pitch, I actually really enjoyed my first and second sessions. My first was used more to discuss my nutrition, current exercise regimen, and fitness goals. My ""trainer"" (Dustin) asked if I was interested in having a personal trainer as a long-term thing, and I explained that I was very comfortable with my current routine and meeting my goals on my own, so I was really only doing this because it was free. He was okay with that and didn't try to change my mind, and used my second session to do more of a physical-therapy type session (which I loved) showing me how to properly stretch out the areas where I tend to feel soreness. I was switched to someone else for my third session, and this guy (don't remember his name) was flaky. He rescheduled me at the last minute 3 different times. I ended up not using this third session, and used my credits to do a couple of yoga workshops, instead. So, for personal training, it seems to really depend on who you get. In terms of the fitness/health assessment, this was free and checks things like cholesterol, body fat percentage, range of motion, etc. I was kind of skeptical of my results, because I am 5'6, 125-130 pounds (size 4), and have a fairly athletic body type, but was told that I should focus on losing weight because I had too much body fat. You don't need to be a toothpick to be healthy, so I was actually kind of offended by this. Facilities: I have never seen the locker room messy. It is always clean, there are always lockers available, and the steam room with the eucalyptus is just luxurious. I love that there is a separate family locker room for parents with opposite-sex children... it prevents awkwardness. My only complaint is that you can't get a long-term locker in order to be able to keep a toiletry bag or other belongings at the facility. I have had memberships at gyms that cost less than 1/2 of this one that have had that option. So, overall, I think this place is well worth $52. I'm not sure where other people are from if they consider this an ""ungodly"" amount of money... it is pretty average for a gym membership everywhere that I have lived, and more than reasonable for this level of facility and amenities... a downright steal if you take advantage of the classes.",positive
"2 stars mean "" Meh. I've experienced better"", and that statement runs very true for this ""gym"" I signed up in May to get fit and to get strong. It was a pretty nice gym, lots of equipment and lots of room. The locker room is very nice and they have steam rooms and private showers. This place has a ton of amenities, but it is not a great gym it is a club, a place to go and great and meet and that's about all. If you are into heavy lifting, or into being able to get to the free weights at all this place is no good unless you go on Friday night when there is no one in there. Try getting in there on a Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and your not going to have enough room to stretch let alone work out. The people that go here are not friendly in fact they are all pretty much scared to make eye contact. Everyone is to focused on the chick in the workout room or staring at themselves in the mirror. The company itself cares more about getting new clients than retaining old ones and the gym is just over crowded. It is a very pricey gym well over $100 for two people and that price goes up even higher with kids. I recently canceled my membership and moved to a real gym not a club. My only advise to this company is start caring about the clients you have more than you do about packing more into your facility.",negative
"How I miss this place.....the pools, hot tubs, steam rooms. I'll be okay since I can pay whopping $20 less a month and go to a 50 year-old YMCA in Pennsylvania ;( Arizona is so fortunate to have new, nice gyms!",positive
"Pricey but worth it. I got a 7day pass to use and fell in love with this place. The locker room was always clean. Unlimited towels to use, lockers (where you DON'T need to bring a lock because it uses your club card in exchange for a key), hair dryers, body wash in the showers, a sauna and the steam room with eucalyptus aroma therapy is something I miss terribly. ( I moved back home after school and was a member for 6 months) This place felt so pretentious when I first walked in- then I joined after my 7 days was up. Best decision I made in my life. Everyone was so friendly. I got two personal training sessions and Matt did a great job. He wasn't pushy and didn't overly pressure me to buy anything...this led up to me buying more training sessions on my own accord. I lost 20lbs with his help. I would take my lady friends (even my mother in-law) here to hang out in a spa like environment. The club advisers who signed me up would get me free passes for my friends to use so we could ""get away"" and relax at a gym. This place was like a huge spa. I always felt energized after leaving this place. Who goes to relax at the gym anyway? Always thought it was sweat and tears until I came here. My husband got a couple hair cuts at the salon and I did a Brazillian. I was given a cup of hot tea and they put a hot lavender scented sash thing that helped relax my shoulders before my wax session. The woman who did it was quick and very nice to keep me talking so I would be distracted from the pain. I also let her know it was my first time. I wish they would open up a club in my state! However when I visit I'll definitely be picking up a 7 day pass and if I move back to AZ....I will not hesitate to join again. They have successfully ruined my expectations of any gym out there- I simply cannot find a duplicate.",positive
"I don't know how people complain about the prices when this is the premier ""chain"" gym in the entire state of Arizona. You get what you pay for, especially with the facilities and cleanliness. Cheaper gyms don't have towel service nor squeeky clean showers that LIfetime has. I've been a member since they first came into Arizona way back when. I lived in the East Valley so I was a member at the Gilbert location and sometimes frequented the Chandler one, next to Ikea. What's very interesting is that even though Lifetime is a huge national chain, all their locations vary on layout and what they offer. Also, they are open 24/7. This is one of the main reasons I'm a member here. I think they're one of the only ones open 24/7. I sometimes go to work out after midnight and I like having the option to do so. It's a trip when you go to a different Lifetime, especially if the floor plan is the opposite of what you're used to! I know the Tempe/Chandler location has tanning beds, which I wish the Goodyear location had. There are a lot of group classes available as well as very good child care. If you take advantage of all that they have to offer, it is NOT expensive. Also, the sales people are to the point. They are not like Bally or LA Fitness where they try to give you a ""deal"" by giving you a year or two worth of membership, so they can literally take all the money from you up front. I know so many people who have prepaid for their gym memberships and never go! Lifetime is month by month so you can quit or place your account on hold. Best ""large"" gym in Arizona!",positive
"I was in the area and wanted a fitness class while here. This is a great facility - huge gym w/ plenty of cardio equipment, free weights & machines. It is spread out so you aren't on top of one another. They also had an indoor track, racquet ball courts & pool. I attend a Body Pump class which the instructor did a great job with. There is a beautiful outdoor trail that runs along the hospital and gym area as well. I would definitely return to it.",positive
"This place is the best. As far as equipment goes, if you can't find it here, you probably don't need it. When any of the machines are out of order, they are not out of order for long. There is generally a sticker or some other kind of notice on the machine with the approximate expected repair date. Not something you would find at your local city rec center. The locker rooms are exceptionally clean, and soap, shampoo, lotion, and towels are provided. There's also a sauna, steam room, and whirlpool in each locker room. There is also an Olympic size swimming pool for those who prefer aquatic sports. Classes are offered, and many of them are free of cost to members. Some of the classes have a small nominal fee. Even though they have family times in the pool area, the locker rooms are restricted to those 14 years of age or older. This means no whining, sniveling brats underfoot when you're trying to wind down after a long, hard workout. This alone is worth the price of membership. I would recommend Lifeworks without hesitation.",positive
Just joined last week. I met with a complimentary trainer who suggested some machines to use and made sure I knew how to use them correctly. Today I took a couple water classes and I enjoyed the instructors for each. Everyone I have spoken to seems very nice and whenever I have a question a gym member seems more than willing to advise me. So...so far so good!,positive
"We joined a couple of months ago, and love the place. It has a wide variety of machines, weights, cardio, strength, and a million classes of all types. Clean as a whistle, and you don't feel like you have to be a musclehead to be there. There are also trainers available for fitness evaluations and instruction on the machines. All this, at a very affordable price.",positive
"Overall I like Lifeworks. The child care area is outstanding...my kids love it, the locker rooms are kept clean and it's not overly expensive to join. For the most part they have all the classes an amenities you could ask for. My only complaint is that when equipment breaks it seems to take an inordinate amount of time to be repaired.",positive
"As part of Southwest General, Lifeworks offers a bunch of programs and deals a lot with rehab and massage. I use lifeworks solely as a workout facility. And it's the facilities are what lures me in to Lifeworks. And it's not super ridiculously expensive. I've joined or visited most all of the gyms in the area here, each having their individual perks. I personally love workout classes and Lifeworks offers a wide variety for every level; land and water. The locker room is spacious with nice showers providing shampoo, conditioner and body wash. There is also a hot tub, steam room and sauna located right in the locker room. You'll definitely make some friends in there. With a new memberships, Lifeworks gives your 6 free training sessions, as well as a few other paid for amenities such as a free Pilates session and a hot water massage. Still being a new member, but have generally been impressed with the services and facilities and am currently happy with my choice.",positive
"It's awesome for this place to have an Intro to Pole class. The Instructor was so friendly and welcoming, and the class wasn't that overwhelming because we were all beginners. They taught us quite a few tricks for a beginning class, and made us feel confident that we could do this. I also went to an aerial class and was able to do some inversions, as well as get some stretches in. The only problem with Live It Up is that it is quite costly. It costs around $25 dollars a class, and a membership isn't much cheaper.",positive
Friendly environment. Great coach. Looking forward to my class everyday. Will recommend to anyone who is interested in pole fitness.,positive
"This is a fantastic pole studio! The instructors are friendly, the classes are fun and everyone at the pole studio is extremely kind and encouraging. Definitely recommend taking an intro class or 4 week beginner course to start off but eventually you'll get addicted and opt for a membership! My favourite part about this studio is that it's more like a small community. You'll get to know the instructors well and the students too. Most classes can only have up to 11 students so you get the individual attention you need when it comes to perfecting or learning a new move. I'm not going to lie - pole is also really hard. And that sense of community is awesome when you're feeling down about not getting something right away. There were so many times in the beginning when I wanted to quit but I kept going because everyone was so encouraging and willing to provide tips and help. Also lots of free parking! :)",positive
Super awesome pole studio. The classes are super fun. All the instructors are really helpful and their routines are super amazing. It has a great community and everyone is really nice.,positive
"I would definitely recommend this studio to anyone interest in pole or has done it for a while! Maggie the owner was super patient when it came to memberships and being new to the studio! Teachers here are also super supportive and go above and beyond to teach not only what the syllabus says for the day but what you think are your strengths and weaknesses. This is one of the few studios I've seen in the GTA That not only just does the exotic part of pole! It is an all round workout! They work on every part of the body. During stretch and aerial yoga classes teachers ask students body parts they would like to work on! Very personalized experiences here through every type of class. If you're looking for a great workout, dancing, stretching, flying in the air doing aerial yoga then this is the place to be!!",positive
"I always look forward to the pole classes here, and after class I'm thinking of when I'm going to be at the studio next. That's how much fun the classes are. Not only are the instructors supportive and encouraging (shout-out to Iris, who is wonderful), but the students also help each other out with tips and pointers, and cheer each other on. It's a great atmosphere to be taking classes in. The pole classes are also great workouts. I agree with a previous reviewer that in addition to learning dance moves, there's a focus on developing the strength to properly perform new pole maneuvers. I've also been to this studio for a pole party for a friend's birthday and Jen made it so much fun! We learned a pole routine step by step and managed to do it all together as a group by the end. I highly recommend group parties here too.",positive
I've been taking classes here for almost half a year. All of the instructors are super attentive and helpful. They are always willing to slow things down when you're having trouble. Definitely recommend this studio!,positive
"Probably one of the only pole fitness studios that focuses on both athleticism and art in all of GTA. I highly recommend both pole and aerial yoga to anyone who is looking to build upper body and core strength while having loads of fun. Maggie, the owner and head instructor is amazing; so are all the other instructors.",positive
I've been going to this studio for half a year and it's been a great experience. Instructors are really nice and fun. Would recommend it.,positive
"I tried aerial yoga for the first time at this studio last week. The address is a bit hard to see from the road at night but there is plenty of free parking. It isn't really yoga in the traditional sense where you move smoothly from pose to pose, and if you can't do some of the moves there aren't really any alternatives. You do require some level of fitness to do this, arm strength and flexibility specifically. The instruction was attentive and ensured everyone's safety, but since people are at different levels it is pretty slow going. I didn't work up a sweat but I felt it in my core the next day. I was wearing shorts and was told capri length pants would be better; I was going based on the photos on the website, which show everyone wearing considerably less than that, and the only mention of clothing is that if you tend to sweat to wear something that covers your underarms. The front door opens right into the studio so it was pretty cool in the room which was something I didn't expect. I would probably go again if it was a little more affordable.",negative
"I've been to several of the big pole studios around Toronto and I have to say I've finally found a studio that feels like home for me! A lot of the other studios I've been to lack that one-on-one dedication that Maggie at Live It Up provides to all of her students. She's very attentive and knows how to instruct based on my body and the level I'm at. It's great to be around an instructor who is a patient and works with you to make it to that next step in your pole practice. She's never too tired to demonstrate and teaches directly to you. I can tell that she's genuinely excited when her students progress and that supportive environment is why I keep coming back to this studio! Another great thing about this studio is that you do NOT have to share a pole. I've been to studios where you're sharing a pole with a stranger in a 1 hour class which essentially means you're paying full price to spend 30 minutes on the pole. I've also found that Maggie is concerned about the safety of her students. She is always there for a spot and will recommend methods to help you enhance your grip. She also makes sure that you have a proper warm up and cool down which I've found a lot of other places will skip over, resulting in soreness and injury. Definitely would recommend this studio to all aspiring pole dancers no matter what level!",positive
"I purchased the groupon in July. It was $45 for 5 classes. Maggie is the owner and instructor. She is very nice, patient and attentive. Maggie is also very encouraging and allows you to play around with variations (with her instructions of course!). I have tried Aerial Yoga (a little slow for me but still fun), Intro to Pole (love this!!) & can't wait to try some more! The studio is very clean & spacious. I helped organize a bachelorette here and Maggie was very accommodating. Everyone had a great time and she also bought us mini cupcakes! The session was one hr (5 girls - most places dt require max of 8 ppl), $35 each, photo/video ops, and a chance to play around on the pole and aerial yoga hammock. I will highly recommend going to Live it up for classes or even a party !!",positive
"Great pole studio! I've been taking pole for a year at other studios but this one is by far the best. Not only is it close to my home, you get free parking too! The instructor is great. She is patient and spends a lot of time working with me to achieve my goals. I'm constantly learning new things to the point where I feel like I don't have enough time to practice. It is a friendly and safe environment and is a great place to meet friends. I highly recommend coming here!",positive
"Have been taken 7 classes, there have very patient and friendly instructors, very professional skill. She makes sure all students achieve something new before leaving the class . I have learned lot and that is the reason I keep coming back to the lesson . :) plus, the place is prefect, clean, large and free parking .",positive
If you are looking for personal training from a guy who knows what he is doing I highly recommend Madden. This guy really knows his stuff when it comes to fitness. His gym has all the equipment you would find at a large place - minus the crowd. Personal 1on1 training and on your schedule.,positive
"I have been going to the Madden Endurance gym since early 2014 and in 3 months I lost 15 pounds. My wife had another personal trainer and she stalled out on her weight loss progress. At the time she stopped losing she was 20 pounds from her goal. she has been with Tony for about 8 months are she is 5 pounds from her goal weight! Tony is a caring, passionate trainer who wont let you give up on yourself. He wants you to better than what you were when you walked through those doors. Unlike most classes, Tony isn't in it for the money.... He actually loves what he does & it shows in his clients.",positive
"Love this place! No ridiculous crowds, or overfilled classes. Personal training and classes in a private environment with great people!",positive
"I've been using his personal trainer services for almost 8 months. I couldn't have asked for a better training experience. There are many different exercises he bring into the session that keeps it exciting and fun. He provides excellent healthy eating tips whenever we go over the ""what did you eat today?"" part of my session. He encourages when I feel like I don't want to go another set and motivates me to do better. Bootcamps are awesome! Fun times with like minded people. Awesome services with reasonable pricing!",positive
"I highly recommend coming this gym if you are looking for a total body workout. Whether it's boxing, kickboxing, boot camp, or personal training, each workout is a full hour of excitement and intensity. Tony's personal training techniques have helped strengthen my old injuries as well :)",positive
"First it's a close location to us, so we thought to give it a try and let me save you time and money.. not a huge place but you have all you need. Great people to spend time with. Very clean place and great customer service.",positive
"My husband and I joined this gym specifically because of geographic location as it's near to our house. My expectations were low, but the price is affordable, lots of handweights, bathrooms are clean and stocked, the people are nice, the gym is relatively quiet (which I like) and I never feel like I have to compete for equipment. This is a great non-meathead gym, perfect for those who prefer not to talk to anyone. Would love to see a few more machines (Hip Abduction), but overall very pleased! I'm grateful to have it so close by.",positive
"If you have class pass this place is sure to please. Their evening circuit training classes are essentially personal training sessions. You'll have lots of one on one attention as sweat and run and lift and sweat. Park above or underground behind metro and they are on the second floor. You can take the stairs or elevator but you are heading there to work out. For those looking for a home gym, their monthly rate is very reasonable and includes these circuit training classes too. Everyone as friendly and everything was clean. I left tired and ready to visit again.",positive
"I was in the search for a new gym since the one I used to go to closed. I tried a few gyms before I came across Metro. I tried their 3 day class pass but I didn't complete the 3 days because I knew this was the place I wanted to be at after the second day. Their circuit training sessions are different everyday and they are intense. While the classes are going on, the gym is still open to other members who want to enjoy the equipment and do their own workouts. But what made me fall for metro is the instructors! Regardless if there are 10 ppl or just 1during the classes, the instructors give you the quality training and proper form techniques. The other gyms I tried, didn't have the personal effect I have been so used to from my previous gym. Metro gives that and so much more. The only thing I would like to see is having the circuit training classes at 5:30 rather than 6:30 and alternating those times between thier Crossfit light and the circuit training. This way it gives individuals in either class a better schedule. If anyone is looking for a gym that offers personal attention, open during regular hours, great equipment, judgment free atmosphere and structured classes then Metro is the spot",positive
"Great place to come. The location is awesome, huge parking garage, and an elevator if needed after the crazy workouts. The staff is friendly and caring. They were extremely helpful in answering my questions and were very accommodating to work out modifiers, when I needed them. The prices are good and I will definitely be back!",positive
Came here for a class last night. This gym has a convenient location with plenty of parking spaces in the back. Staff is friendly from the front desk to the personal trainers. Restrooms and showers are clean. Large windows for a great workout view. My favorite machine is the rowing machine.,positive
Best gym in Charlotte! Kettlebell & TRX lovers will find everything they need here. A large Cross fit section as well. Perfect location and great management team.,positive
"Metro Fitness has changed my life. I hated working out for the longest time. I am proud to say that I have been consistently working out since last November doing CrossFit. All the instructors are professional and so friendly, they are very patient as well. The staff is also awesome and make you feel like you belong. The center is so beautiful, well kept and clean.... a definite plus! They are worth every penny and are hands down thee best facility in Charlotte (I belonged to a total of 6 gyms in the Charlotte area before joining Metro Fitness!!) Give them a chance, you will not regret it!!",positive
"I've worked out a lot of gyms and with a lot of personal trainers and Metro is the best. It's clean, professional and they are serious about fitness. While everyone is pretty focused on their workouts don't be afraid to ask for help. The trainers and staff are extremely professional and spend time on the floor. They will gladly help you learn a new exercise or show you the proper form. I work out with Thea routinely and can't say enough great things about her. She is a constant professional, stickler for good form and knows how to motivate me. She customizes my workouts and constantly coaches and me and pushes me to achieve more. I highly recommend Metro Fitness.",positive
"Best gym i have ever been a member. Sure the sports club LA at the four seasons in Miami was trendy and chic with their ambient light and house music but metro has something that not many other gyms have, a real knowledge of what physical fitness actually means. The crossfit classes are insane and will redefine what you ever believed a workout was. The best part about this gym is the sense of family, everybody suffers together, we cheer each other on, and we reach levels of athleticism that we did not think were possible before. If you want your gym experience to be some meaningless chore somewhere else than have fun with that, if you want to beat all your friends at every sport imaginable then join metro",positive
"At age 39, I realized that I've let my couch-potato ways get the better of me over the last few years. I'm a big guy. 6'4, but I topped out at 384 lbs. In October I started dropping weight by adjusting my diet. 50 lbs into my weight loss I hit a plateau that had held for almost a month. A friend at work recommended Metro Fitness and their training approach. I signed up for a year, and a package of 30 personal training courses. I am 2 weeks in, and already I am starting to see a change. My weight hasn't really started to drop, but my body composition is already beginning to change. I feel better, have less pain in my legs and back, and am really excited about the change happening with my body. The staff are fantastic. My trainer is amazing. I got tired last week during a workout, and he brought me a 50 lb dumbbell to hold for a while. When he reminded me that this is what I had already lost, it really kicked the rest of my workout into high gear.He also taught me with exercises that I can do on the road, so while traveling this week I've managed to keep up the working out. I've tried dozens of gyms over the last 20 years, always promising myself to get back to my high school football player weight / physique. And every time has been a failure. But I think Metro has the 'secret sauce' which is going to keep me comign back again and again each week until I reach my goal!",positive
"What a great facility in a convenient part of Myers Park. Went herd for a Yelp Kicks Butt class, and was very impressed with the staff and workout. A good mix of newbies and experienced folks for the Crossfit class, and they made all of us feel comfortable with the workout. A few shakes were even handed out post workout. Thanks for the workout Dar & company. Can't wait to return!",positive
"This was a yelp sponsored event that was both a crossfit and athletic conditioning class the gym offers. I am providing a review of the class and instructors rather than the overall gym experience. So if you are interested in either of these 2 classes then read on my friend! There were not many people in the class familiar with crossfit so the instructor described crossfit and it's main principles. He provided an overview of each movement before we started making sure our form was correct. We did a dynamic warm-up one of which was a weighted sled push. Oh boy was I gonna feel this the next day! By now the long sleeves have come off and we were ready to start the ""workout of the day"". The workout was scaled in half since there were a lot of first timers present. Being a regular cross fitter this was not an issue since the time was not cut in half so I could just do more. The workout consisted of a 250 meter row, 10 push presses, 10 box jumps and 5 burpee like movements. You are to perform as many sets as possible in 15 minutes. Doesn't sound hard right? Wrong!!! I was sweating within the first 5 minutes of the 15 minute time limit. Please keep in mind the weights and height of the box were based on what you think you could do and you go at your own pace. There was a lot of encouragement from the instructors as we'll as form correction along the way. Even better I did not have someone screaming at me the entire time. I want a tough workout but hey I don't like to be treated as if I am in the marines. Next it was time to move to the athletic conditioning class. The female instructor was sure buff and cut. I knew off the bat this would get results if I came on a regular basis. There were 6 stations setup. She went and demonstrated each movement and length of time to stay at each station. 4 of the stations were 2 minute increments and the others were 30 seconds on 30 seconds rest for 2 minutes. This workout looked a lot easier than it was. I am in good shape and I found myself needing to take breaks especially after having finished the crossfit class just prior to this segment. I will be double sore tomorrow. This is what I look for in a class because normally I do not find them challenging enough. I would definitely come back for this class. A quick reminder that all workouts can be scaled to your level so do not be afraid to try these classes. At the end of the event we were treated to either shots of chocolate banana or strawberry banana smoothies. Okay no argument on my part I will take one. Too bad they weren't spiked..just kidding. It was the perfect and well deserved surprise after a challenging class. We stretched as a group and then class was over. I loved it!!",positive
"Swanky! Yes, indeed. Metro Fitness is a beautiful fitness club. Not only will you find tons of great cardio equipment, but there are also plenty of weight machines, free weights and an entire space dedicated to CrossFit. So, not only is the gym top notch, but the trainers and management are spot on. They take a great interest in your fitness and walk you through the best ways to get your sweat on. I came to Metro for a free CrossFit class in honor of Yelp Kicks Butt. I didn't quite know what to expect, but after an hour or so I left happy and worked oooooout. Our two trainers, Jimmy & Thea, put the 16 of us through a rigorous, but inspiring workout, that combined athletic drills, weights, cardio machines and more. They made sure that everyone was working out hard but safe and really explained each exercise and it's importance. Dar, the owner, was also on hand to watch our form and generally be awesome. Yay for encouragement and super friendly staff! So, I really adore this gym and I would love to join full up and take advantage of the incredible amenities and CrossFit classes, but it's pretty out of my budget right now. Hopefully Metro can offer some other options in the future so those of us who aren't members can come once in a while and enjoy their fantastic gym & classes!",positive
"If you are looking for a workout, check out Metro Fitness Club. It's located on the second floor above Mellow Mushroom on Selwyn. Talk about temptation, there is a pizza place underneath, if you use their cardio equipment you are staring directly at Yoforia, Reid's Fine Foods, Nolen's Kitchen...focus and determination is key. The parking is easy and you can either take the stairs or an elevator to get there. The facility is brand new and it shows. I was completely impressed with the cleanliness, the quality of equipment, and the nice upscale feel of the interior. However, I didn't commit to sign up because it came at a price that was a tad out of my reach for a recreational gym goer, like me. To use the basic facility it is approximately $100 for a couple and it costs a bit more if you want the specialized training program. I've got to say that the training looked intense and no doubt it will for sure get you in shape. I may rethink this after the holidays! *wink* The locker room was really nice, workout towels everywhere, and the staff were friendly as well. It's in a great area with a delicious view!",positive
"I have been a member for almost a year, love the classes. I mostly attend Zumba classes, GREAT instructors. I find the only problem with the classes are some of the people who don't seem to be aware of a few important things. I would like to bring attention to a few basic dance facts: Never upstage the instructors. Never text while a class is in progress. When the music starts, please refrain from conversations. Group dancing is distracting to the instructors and others. If you arrive late, please stay in back. If you need to leave early, please stay in back. Be aware of your space and persons on both sides and behind you. Do not move all around the room while class is in session. Jogging is not acceptable while class is in session. Respect the instructor and others while in class. Instructors should never be approached while they are instructing. No one has a designated space. Doing a different dance from instructor is rude and distracting. If you follow these simple suggestions, everyone can have fun.",positive
"So far this is my favorite gym in Arizona. It's variety of locations are convenient and the dollar amount on the membership is right on point with the packed value that the gym brings. What's most important to me at a gym is the vibe and environment, and the people it attracts. This gym attracts and promotes greatness. The motivational posters on the wall down to the types of equipment and classes range from the hardcore and bad ass too the serene and chill for recovery. I had an incredible consultation with Will Taylor at the Scottsdale pavilions location, he helped adjust some flexibility on me and now I feel like I have an upgraded body awareness. He also recommended a trainer exactly for my goals and put the first session on the house since it's those specialties are beyond his scope of practice. Very professional. Very friendly, very knowledgeable. Thanks mountainside. The only upgrade I would like to see is actually the music they play. Could be more motivational and have harder beats/songs, better variety instead of just top 20 hits. Would like to hear more metal, dubstep, EDM, rap, workout music instead of club music (:. One more thing GET BIGGER TIRES and REAL tires!!",positive
"The Pima-IndianBend location is spectacular! I spent much of the summer in Europe bike racing for Team USA Paralympics. Now that I've been back this fall working hard at Mountainside, I must compliment the Fitness team at this location. Everyone here rocks! Super friendly, always helpful, the place is kept spotless. Not sure how they do it, but it makes the place comfortable and inviting. Thanks for another great year, and keep the compliments coming.",positive
This gym offers yoga but unfortunately the noise level from the surrounding classes is so loud and so intense that it shakes the floor. There is no relaxation possible with that much bass permeating through the walls and floor. This issue has been brought to the attention of the management by several people including the yoga instructors and many people in the class and nothing has been done. Tyler the manager suggests the only possible recourse is to cancel the classes rather than ask the high intensity classes to turn down the volume. However the noise level in the high intensity classes is already at an unsafe volume it's honestly louder than any concert I've attended. I would not recommend this gym . For the price you should be allowed a quiet atmosphere for yoga and a saf e environment for high intensity classes that does not risk long term hearing loss. Also when concerns like these are brought to the attention of management sensible solutions should be sought in a timely manner not ignored. Also the temperature of the gym is really warm nearly too hot for cardio.,negative
"This is the WORST gym I've ever used, at any location! It is over priced and always packed, their unprofessional associates have less than enough experience. If you want to try and cancel forget it, they will steal your money! I am not one to write reviews, but after speaking with unprofessional staff at the corporate level and getting nowhere as well as not having a customer support service here I am. Consider yourself warned!",negative
It's extremely irritating when you have your headphones turned up to max and you can still hear the lady next to you on the elliptical talking on the phone.,negative
"If you like a warm gym, Mountainside Fitness is for you! I have been a member there a few months, and while on the treadmills, I have been pouring sweat during my hour-long runs. I'm a proficient runner who has qualified for the Boston Marathon, so this has nothing to do with Fitness. Rather, the company informed me that as per company policy, the gym is set to 74 Degrees! As a former personal trainer and someone who's been around gyms since the early 90s, Mountainside Fitness operates the warmest chain of gyms I've ever experienced. When a gym temperature is set to 74 (most gyms are around 68 degrees), that doesn't account for the concentrated workout areas such as the treadmill area. All of the body heat can add an increased temperature variance of 4-6 degrees. I brought my digital thermometer in there last weekend when the treadmills were packed and it read 80-degrees. It was also insanely humid (probably due to the sheer sweat volume of everyone doing cardio in an oven) Other chains such as Lifetime Fitness and Gold's Gym keep their temps well into the 60's (Lifetime Fitness keeps theirs at 67 degrees). So if you don't like a warm gym, and don't like sweating to an unnecessary degree when on the treadmill or other cardio machines, Mountainside Fitness won't be the gym for you. Serious runners and athletes would much prefer Lifetime Fitness. I used to be a member there and running in the cool temps they set is wonderful! I'll be cancelling my membership and heading over to Lifetime soon, as will a few of my friends. A gym that skimps on AC to save money isn't worth my time. Smarten up Mountainside!",negative
"As someone that was in club management for many years in the D.C. area, I'll do my best to give a fair review. I'm only giving two stars for the following reasons... I will say that the club is very clean. Hands down, they have a crew that comes in during the day and thoroughly cleans the equipment and the amenities and they do a very good job of it. Other clubs have a bit to be desired in this area, so I'll give MS a big thumbs up for that. They also have a great variety of equipment for everyone. Free weights, a big assortment of cable machines, etc, and it's not an intimidating atmosphere by any stretch (which is great for anyone just starting out). If a piece of equipment is down, it normally gets fixed in a few days (to be fair from experience, equipment repair specialists don't grow on trees and have previous scheduled calls). Where I fault the club is that they don't enforce any of their own policies: quite a few signs banning cell phone talking and members pay zero attention to that. Staff, to include management, have walked by individuals yapping on their phones and haven't said anything. If I have to crank up my headphones due to someone being loud on their phone, that's a problem. I've watched people take selfies in the mirrors with unknowing members in the background, and that's a privacy no-no. They also don't enforce the dropping of weights (which tends to sound like a B-52 strike in the distance), and members have also shown up in flip-flops (or no shoes at all) and I'm pretty sure that's a health code thing in AZ. These are policies that are plainly posted, however to my knowledge have never been enforced. All in all, the club is ok at best. Just waiting for Equinox to open up in Scottsdale....eventually.",negative
"After a year of coming here is still two stars, Facility equipment has improved and the staff still wonderful, but if I hear one more excuse about their cable provider and the kind of service they receive, I am going to hold payment from my bank, I just paid an annual additional fee for club improvements and the TVs still not working. Get it together people everything else is working fine.",negative
For $43 a month you'd think there'd be better customer service and friendlier staff. Not a very welcoming environment to walk into.,negative
"I've been in my new home for about 5 months. During those 5 months, I've wanted to test the Mountainside Fitness gym that was literally across the street. Why I didn't is why many people don't. The process is one of the worst consumer experiences I have every experienced. Over the past 4 months I've checked in on their website. The cost has always been the same. I thought about just signing up and dealing with whether I even liked the place after the fact. They offered a 5-Day free trial. I printed it out and looked at it for a month. Did I really want to go through the process? Today (4th of July) I decided I'd force myself through it. That was at 7am. Being just across the street you might think I'd be there by 7:30 - 8 at the latest, right? Try 1pm. That is how long I put it off. So... I bet you are thinking that it was all in my head and everything went as you would expect, right? You would be wrong. So... Walking in, I fill out the form, the form is given to some man younger than my daughter, and proceeded to take me on a facility tour. When we arrive back at his desk he starts talking about packages. I explain to him that I've watched the plans online for a few months, I am aware of the costs and what I was planning on doing is using the 5-day pass for a few visits at different times of day and see if the club has the capacity to meet its membership. I'm not going to pay $50 a month to wait for equipment. So... the sales guy tells me the following - word for word - If you leave the club today without buying a membership, you will have to pay $95 to use the rest of your FREE 5-day pass. Are you serious? Yes he said, club policy. I nearly lost my cool, but held on. I may join, but they took a 100% sure deal and made it a maybe - and I WILL tell EVERY person I can what a slimy place Mountainside Fitness is. I will spend the next few hours posting this experience many different places.",negative
"Needed a place to workout in Arizona as 24 Hour Fitness has packed up and left, and my parents had previously been members of Mountainside. Michael quickly got me set up with a membership and was more than helpful with any questions I had. The staff, no matter what time of day (I work graveyard so to keep my body clock right, this was 4:30am) were friendly and cordial and the free coffee was a welcome surprise. The facilities are kept clean and there are plenty of weight stations, mat space for stretching, suspension training and cardio equipment (hooray for the gym that has arc trainers). The locker room/showers are always clean and well stocked with soap and the towel supply (always a plus) is frequently replenished. It surprised me how crowded it was early with at least 7 personal trainers all working with clients, all with smiles. Saw many of the same people every day and it appeared to be a communal environment.",positive
"This use to be the best gym around. Now since multiple changes in policies it has turned into a dump. They give ""guest passes"" that are only good for people that haven't ever been members. Due to friends coming back in town for the holidays. I have been unable to workout with them unless they want to pay $10 for a day pass. Why should you give guess passes and restrict my use of them. I was a member for 3 years and just canceled my membership today. I urge anyone to go to another gym for this along with multiple other reasons.",negative
"We joined Mountainside Fitness since we moved farther away from the Gold's-turned-EOS we'd been members of for a few years. The cost is a bit more, but the amenities are clearly on a nicer level. Enrollment was easy and when we both turned down their complimentary personal training session that comes with each membership, we weren't pressured about it. I've never had any issue with any of the cardio machines. (And I see people wipe down their machines all the time--not sure what the review stating differently is about.) There are a ton of weight machines and free weights. I've never had any problem finding space to do my workouts or find the right weights. Everyone is pretty conscious to re-rack and put their dumbbells in the proper place, which is EONS better than the crowd at Gold's/EOS. I've taken some Power Yoga classes, and their yoga studio is much nicer than I expected from a non-yoga studio. I don't love that there's a random wall right in the middle of the room, but I guess it doesn't affect the classes. The class itself is awesome for a workout, but there's not much of the hippy-dippy, introspective Namaste vibe that made me fall in love with yoga. Still, if you want to sweat, it's perfect. The locker rooms look really nice (haven't actually used them yet since we live so close), and the cafe/smoothie area seems well stocked. And there's free coffee in the morning! So, on a scale of my now-defunct Golds/EOS membership and my current membership to the Village Health Clubs and Spas, I'd say Mountainside is a perfect match in-between the two levels.",positive
Love the gym love my friends there but too many times they don't show up to open in the morning it's very discouraging to those of us with a time frame.,negative
"This gym might be OK for some classes or weights but forget it if you want to use the steppers. The machines are in the last row and high up, the hardest machine in the hottest area with no air circulation. But worst of all usually 2 of the 6 are not working at any time. Many of us have complained repeatedly and no one ever does anything about it. So that is 1/3 or 33% of the equipment that does NOT work and is always ""under repair"". One machine has been down FOR MONTHS. It is infuriating. There are elliptical machines that there are many of in the back row as well. These could be replaced with more steppers, but at least if they kept the 6 repaired. But that appears tp be to much to ask.",negative
Nice friendly staff. Open with lots of equipment choices. Nice and clean. Looks like a recent renovation. Juice bar. Bathrooms are nice.,positive
I rushed over after work to speak to someone in regards the rates. I was told that it would be a few minutes since gentleman was all ready in the middle of signing up a new client. The reception was kind enough to show me around while I was waiting. After the tour client had left and customer service rep sat at his chair for a good hour. I got up and ask reception and she said that he knew I was there and would grab me he was ready. In the meantime his feet were up on the desk and have a full on conversation with what sounded like his girlfriend. I was so disgusted I walked out and left. Reception was very apologetic. Really disappointed.,negative
"This gym has everything I need for a good workout...lots of cardio equipment, weight machines, free weights, and a pretty generous amount of free classes (I've done some of the yoga and fitness classes and like them all, though sometimes the room is crowded so try to get there a bit early). My son goes to the childcare and I am comfortable leaving him there and he is happy with it. It's not the cheapest gym, but it's not the worst, either, and since I need a place with a non-scary and convenient childcare it's definitely the best local choice. There are some extra Scottsdale-y members but that's just the location, and doesn't reflect upon the gym itself, and there are plenty of ""normal people"" there, too. Overall, it's a good place to go!",positive
"Pretty good gym. I like that they have power yoga, and the teachers are sometimes comparable to those of private yoga studios! They just remodeled and added a new spin room. I think there will be more construction underway soon so just be aware of that! I like that they have internet, I don't like that they don't display the password where you can see it (like on a treadmill). I hate when I'm already working out and I go to use my spotify only to realize I didn't get the password and cannot listen to my music. They need to fix that. Also, they have towels available, which is great! Gold's gym on Northsight does not provide towels so this is a huge plus.",positive
"Mountainside is not only the worst fitness club I have ever seen but the worst business ever. Not only do they not care about their members but in fact they don't care about the health and safety... and her's proof. Some ""genius"" decided that they needed high intensity lights that strobe to the music in the spin room. Most members, and even instructors, complained and several had to stop spinning as they were getting migraines. Rather than removing the lights the club removed the switch taht allowed us to switch them off. In my case one day I became highly disoriented and nauseous. I felt as though I was about to faint so I got off the bike, visually indicated to Randy the instructor, that I felt bad and I left the spin room. I went to the manager's office to report this. Then I sat down to avoid collapsing. Numerous members, as well as several of your own staff, saw me and saw that I was in obvious distress, as did others in the spin class. Despite my very obvious distress at no time did Randy bother to check on me when I left the class or after, which is totally irresponsible on his part. Furthermore none of the club staff offered to get a doctor or an ambulance, or drive me to an emergency clinic. In fact I had to request an Advil or Tylenol and even that was not readily available. Later that same day Ms. Sarah Mitcham, the Club Manager, called me to tell me that I had caused a disruption leaving the class and hence my membership was cancelled effective immediately. She did not even have the decency to ask for my version of events. It seems that the instructor had told her that I had caused a disturbance in leaving the class. Not only do I deny this but several members who were in the same class have offered to testify that I did not cause any disturbance and they too object to the strobe lights and feel they are detrimental to their well-being. Upon further investigation it appears that I may have suffered a slight seizure. There are numerous medical articles, which claim that strobing lights are a cause of seizures even in people who do not have epilepsy, and even lighting companies sell such lighting systems with warnings. I wrote a letter to the club president asking to discuss this but he didn't have the courtesy to replay which is just further proof that they don't care about their members.",negative
"Jan's review pretty much sums up everything I feel. My wife and I have been members for about 6 years. The new renovation was a joke. New floors and annoying disco lights in spin. Bikes still same old pieces of junk. Loose handlebars & seats. They are worn out and used up; they need to be replaced. And all the better spin instructors jumped ship and are gone. Recumbent bikes all have loose seats and no pedal straps. Wide screen theatre area has 3 seats! REALLY. Not enough weights and equipment for muscle classes. My wife has been waiting 3 yrs for promised additional weights. Free towels are nice but are now all ratty and feel like a steel wool pad. Time to replace them. Mountainside, it's time to get your act together.",negative
"I have been a member here for several months now and I love it here. I read some of the reviews of the gym and was disgusted by what some people wrote about this place. Obviously someone needs to learn some respect and control themselves. I don't believe destroying other peoples property is the way to make a point. I wonder why they looked at you funny...? Grow up. Anyway, this gym is actually very nice. The staff is very friendly and the gym is always clean. The classes are great and there are usually always on time. I love the space this gym has. The locker rooms are not at all like the ones at most other gyms I have been to. They are spacious and that hairy naked guy that parades himself about in every gym is defiantly absent (thank goodness). All in all, the atmosphere is very relaxing and quiet for a gym. It keeps me motivated and going. Highly recommended!",positive
"New to Yelp, but I have been a Mountainside Fitness member for four years. The clubs across the valley are always clean and comfortable. My main club on Shea and Sahuaro Dr just did a redo of the look and feel and the place feel brand new. The equipment is always clean and in proper working order. The locker rooms are not scary and the interaction with the staff keeps me getting up and coming in early even on the ""coldest"" mornings in Scottsdale.",positive
"I just got a letter in the mail telling me that Moutainside is changing the terms of our contract and is now going to start charge me a ""annual enhancement fee of $25 for your individual plan"". So lemme get this straight.. I'm being penalized for being single? Yeah, there's this guy named Uncle Sam who already screws me over for being single and having a good job...I don't need my gym doing that too. Especially when there is Abby Bella Dance Studio an LA Fitness and 24 Hour Fitness close by (I'll give you their addresses if you're interested in not being taken advantage of). Seriously..the Audacity and what's an enhancement fee anyway? Unless liposuction is now included in my membership, I'm taking my business elsewhere. ***Update: Mountainside management's definition of an ""enhancement fee"" is a joke. I'm going to file that explanation under NOT MY PROBLEM. What you consider ""enhancements"" that you want to charge me a surplus for (without my consent) most of the general public would consider operation costs and keeping up with competition. This isn't a condo association. I don't have any invested stake or profit sharing with this company and therefore Mountainside shouldn't be allowed to charge what I would consider to be a B*S* special assessment. Further stating this fee is an ""industry standard"" is a farce. In the past I have been a member at: 24hr Fitness, LA Fitness, XSport, Abby Bella and Bally's...NONE of these gyms have ever tried to sneak in some annual ""enhancement fee"" ever.. so who are you comparing yourself too? Lastly, since I've been bashing you all over town I just found out my co-worker who also has a membership at your club isn't getting charged this annual enhancement fee...how fair is that?",negative
"We've had a family membership here for a couple years now and we love it. Would do 5 Stars if they had a pool or other water related items but still gets a strong 4 Stars. Not long ago they remodeled this location an added a boxing ring, new machines etc. I have a VIP locker that I love they do my laundry daily and put clean towels, a bottle of water and a fresh mint in my locker each day all for about $1.25 per day. They have 15 of these lockers located in their own special area with TV's nice leather benches etc. The lockers are huge with push botton codes no locks. The gym is always clean. The child care is fantastic open 7 days a week my children love it. They even have parents night out where you can bring your children for a couple hours on Friday night and go out while they do arts and crafts. The juice bar has shakes with all natural ingredients and its almost always open. The location is very convenient on Shea and 116th Street. Theres a full size indoor basketball court and to many other amenities to list oh yea a dry heat sauna and my favorite the steam room. Huge selection of weights and bikes. If you live in the area this is the gym for you.",positive
"Avoid like the plague! Terrible people rip-off scam, they sign you up after a Groupon offering great value, carry on charging you when your not even in the country, I have since left the US and explained my situation to the Manager -- who then decides to send a conned contract to a debt collection agency. AVOID - DO NOT deal with this company!!",negative
The yoga classes here are wonderful. Some start as early as 6:30 am which is a great way to start the day. I also appreciate the fact that they have Saturday and Sunday classes.,positive
"This is a very nice, new looking gym. The layout of the gym is great since the cardio location overlooks the whole place. I like the tvs on each of the cardio equipment as well. The machines and benches are all better quality than other gyms have--feel more comfy with more padding. There's a bball court as well. I've never done any group classes but they have 1 or 2 rooms for those as well. I think membership is somewhere around $40/month which is on par for this level of gym.",positive
"Wow, all I can say is this place SUCKS big balls. Take your money to 24 Hour Fitness (which is literally 3 minutes from here), where your business will be appreciated. My boyfriend and I joined back in early summer. We paid for 2 full-year memberships. We paid nearly $500 each, which I feel is high for a gym. Don't go here if you are interested in a serious workout... All the women come all dolled up. And all the guys are meatheads (especially the trainers, who need to really lay off the roids). The gym is very nice... clean, good/new equipment. The reason for the 1 star, however, is due to their policies and lack of customer service. When joining, they rush you through the contract to get you to sign, skipping over the fact that you are responsible for inquiring any additional fees that they deem as necessary. So, after my boyfriend and I had been working out at this location for a month, we got a bill in the mail saying we owed an additional $52 for their renovations. EXCUSE ME!?! This gym is like 5 years old... When I called to ask what specifically the charges were for, the manager told me it was for the new IMAX Theater, valet parking.... the list goes on. Are you serious!? Valet parking at a gym? I've never heard of something so absurd. Get exercise and walk to your own car... This is a gym for goodness sakes! They refused to take the charges off my bill even though I would never use their useless new amenities. They said if the charges weren't paid by the due date, I wouldn't be able to work out until they were paid off (with late fees). HAHAHA. So I went to Craigslist, sold both my memberships and my 20 personal training sessions. And I didn't have to pay their outrageous fees. There were other shortcomings, but honestly, my BP is already going through the roof from writing this review. I'm done. You can go fuck yourself Mountainside Fitness!!",negative
The classes and facilities are phenomenal. Highly recommend MSF! They're always updating the facilities and keep everything top notch!,positive
"After going to LA Fitness (moon valley) for about 12 years my wife and I finally made a decision to make the switch and join this gym. This was mainly because of the location, plus the new one is opening at happy valley which is even going to be closer to me so the convenience factor played the biggest role in my decision. Anyways, the gym is different and so is the equipment so I knew it would take some time to adjust. But after attending mountainside for few weeks I'm definitely a bit frustrated and I kinda regret my decision. I honestly don't understand the price difference (at LA we we paying $50 for both of us, here we're paying about $70) but we literally get nothing extra. Yes the locker rooms are little nicer here but that's about it. Anyways, I am mainly frustrated with the equipment more than anything. Everything moves and the machines are way too close to one another. Like uncomfortably close, at least when compared to my old gym. The machines are not stationary (drilled into the floor) so when I try to do some curls the whole machine moves (one time it slid to the left and made contact with the guy next to me. The plates are metal and rusted! Why couldn't they have rubber around them? This way you can't use them for any exercise other than to load on the machines and then lift. I'm really really hoping that this happy valley location will be little better. Otherwise I'll probably go back. Fingers crossed.",negative
"I have going to this location for awhile and take my kids to the child care. My kids keep getting sick from this location and today I know why. The children's club manager is negligent in that she allows sick kids into the club. This morning I saw a very sick child in the kid's club area and I informed them that the kid looked sick. They said it was okay because the mother said ""the child is on antibiotics, so it's okay."" The poor child appeared very miserable and snot covered his face. I told the kid's manager about how the child, she said that as long as the snot's not coming out green, it's fine. She was very short and had an attitude that I expressed concern. She finished the brief conversation being snippy, saying that's it's just my preference if I wanted to put my kids in there. Clearly I quickly left, not wanting to expose my healthy children to the child who is so sick that he's on antibiotics. I am appalled and disgusted by the kid's club judgement and lack of customer service. I will not be coming back to that location and will be letting everyone know of their child care negligence, irresponsibility, and lack of human decency.",negative
"This is the only gym I've been to aside from ones on university campuses and I really enjoy coming here. The staff is super friendly, the facility and locker rooms are clean. For $44/mo you get unlimited access to the gym and classes - yoga, Pilates, Zumba, etc. The rate goes down to $38/mo if you sign the yearly contract. You also get guest passes and can bring in family members for free every Sunday. I especially like the fact that they're open pretty late (until 11 pm weekdays and 9 pm weekends), since I'm a habitual night owl. They're currently updating the cardio equipment - new treadmills now have WiFi and streaming capabilities, perfect for watching Netflix during those long runs! Hoping that they'll upgrade the elliptical and bicycles soon too, which are starting to look a little rundown. There are plenty of free weights and machines for strength training, also a basketball court. Other features: a smoothie/protein shake station, childcare area, sauna in the locker room. I tried one free training session and didn't love it, but that was a couple years ago so can't speak for the current trainers. One personal pet peeve I have here is the fact that many gymgoers like to use outdoor voices in the indoor weights area. Literally happens every other time I come here and distracts from the workout experience, but I guess you can't force people to be considerate!",positive
"I have attended the Surprise, Peoria and North Phoenix locations. I had a really bad experience at the North Phoenix location. I was looking for a mat area to stretch before my spin class. The only mat I could find was apparently some private class. It was not clearly marked as private. I was treated very rudely and abrasively. I tried another area for stretching but the private class took all the mats. It should have been clearly labeled as private and members should not have to go without club amenities like a mat to stretch on.",negative
"Love the classes, just wish they had more. Forget about taking a class on Friday Sat or Sun. Those are my days off and I wanna sleep in. But you have to get in early and few classes to choose from. Daycare is revamped with a new crew. Daycare closes at 3 on Sunday. Can you please stay open till 5 at least? All these things are not brought up when you sign the contract. So get a month to month membership. Staff is friendly, love Lori and her yoga class. She's so great!!",negative
"Courtney at guest services is so rude and un professional. She gave me a hard time about a promotion I brought in, sent directly from mountain side! She was rude about the situation, didn't explain anything and then didn't even honor the entire promo as there was other free things included. She is always on her cell phone, and then never at the desk where she should be working, but up walking and talking to people or in the child care area talking with her children she leaves in there all day. I am not the only one that noticed this as a few other members and workers have said the same thing about their experience with her.",negative
"The Mountainside fitness north Phoenix location is reneging on contractual commitments. I purchased a $3700 personal training package, and they are refusing to honor the unlimited expiration date portion of it. Jeremy the general manager there is on accommodating and unhelpful. Don't do personal training through mountain fitness",negative
"No only does the gym have all the equipment necessary to keep my workouts new and fun after the remodel, but it is cared for by a team of friendly and attentive staff. As a new mom, I am so thankful for the child care center within the gym. A special shout out to all the ladies that give extra attention to my little one so her mommy can get in a completed workout. I appreciate being able to get back to the gym as I love lifting weights. From obtaining my membership to signing up for child care to becoming one of the every day gym rats, they always make me feel welcome and like a friend.",positive
"We joined based on the classes that they offered and the daycare option. One month after joining three of the classes were canceled and never came back. When my child was five months old, I watched one of the daycare girls hold my daughter on her hip with one hand like she was a-year-old. When my daughter fell backwards, because of her lack of neck strength, the girl had to literally catch her from falling. NEVER went back.",negative

I just joined Mountainside Fitness (MF) oat the Arrowhead location with my BFF. So far my experience has been outstanding. Met with Brian in the personal training Dept for 1 hour consultation. He was very knowledgeable & we learned a lot about all components for a successful lifestyle change! Now I have visited their Carefree & I17 location since it's closer to my house - so if my BFF isn't working out I still go ... Just to Carefree location instead. The staff at both locations have been EXTREMELY friendly!!! Today I took M1 with Dana (Carefree) & she was incredible!!!! She also recommended another class to help with learning the moves to help me with M1 class. That class beat me today ... But I will be back!!! If you want to join a gym that COMPLETELY makes you comfortable going too no matter your weight / looks etc than join!!! Hopefully you tell them I referred you! See Ya There!,positive
"Lots of empty machines, but I always have to wait for the ones I need. They might want to rethink their inventory. It's too hot in this gym. They're stingy on the AC and their wifi never works. We quit the gym after a rep got smart with me when I asked him why the wifi never works. Maybe he'll think twice about being a smartass to customers in the future, or maybe not. Not my problem anymore. Also, they offer 10 free passes per year, but they don't tell you that the passes have to be used by different guests. Only 2 free passes per guest!",negative

"Was a member for about a year or so when I lived nearby. The gym was always very clean and well cared for. Generally if a piece of equipment was down, it wasn't down for very long.

Sadly I moved away and need to find a new gym but if anyone is looking for a nice, comfortable gym with a ton of options, Mountainside fits the bill.",positive
"4 stars only because of: No water fountain in locker room No paper towel to dry hands after washing the in the bathroom & the hand blower is ancient.

"Horrible experience still going on. I joined Mountainside Fitness because it had a couple of good step instructors.(Although in the summertime, it gets very hot there - even have to open the door - to get air!!) After about a year, I began working every day so I put my membership on hold (they charged me $10 a month) until I determined whether or not I would be able to attend classes. I renewed the hold status once, for a total of 6 months. On the last renewal of the hold status, I was told that unless I went back to being a regular member after the 3 months was over and wanted to join at a later date, my membership would expire and I would have to pay the initiation fee again. Since I was still working and found other classes elsewhere at times that were convenient to me, I let the membership expire. Little did I realize that they began to charge me for full membership when the ""hold"" status expired! I never discovered it (they deducted for 2 months) until my credit card was breached, my CC company replaced the old one, and when Mountainside tried to make the auto deduction, it didn't go through. When I told them that I was no longer a member and what I had been told, they basically said tough - I owed them for 2 more months in addition to he two they charged me for, and I would have to go into the office and formally withdraw. I did go into one of the centers about a month later, and let them know that I was no longer a member, reiterated what their rep had told me - that membership would automatically expire if I didn't renew the hold status. They insisted that I pay the fees that they are continuing to charge me. I told the no, I wouldn't, and that they had already gotten 2 months of fees that they didn't deserve, and that we could call it a wash. She refused. The membership director called, insisting that I pay ""what I owed them."" The fees are now a little over $150 and they continue to send me bills every month, (so the total continues to grow), e-mails, calls, dunning notices, etc. This place is has horrible customer service. They are snotty and arrogant - they are not even taking responsibility for what their staff tells people. Just the fact that they require you to come in and drop instead of being able to drop by phone is a pain and tells me that they are desperate for money - or greedy - take your choice. Mind bogling",negative
"I had membership at Mountain Side Fitness before I shifted to LA Fitness to reclaim some of my unused training sessions. Objectively speaking, Mountain Side Fitness is a level above LA Fitness with a premium look and feel, and overall better services for clients - free towels, an executive room for members who pay more and a really good child care center; they even have a channel on each of the cardio machines that lets you watch the camera feed from the kids room. Also, they have a small café where you can order shakes/smoothies/juices of your choice - billed directly to your monthly statement. Coming to cardio and other weight equipment, the equipment at Mountain Side Fitness is not that different from other gyms like LA Fitness or 24 Hours Fitness and their personal training offerings are not very different compared to other gyms. And with respect to membership prices, it is a little higher than LA Fitness (about $5 - $8 more) but you get what you pay for. Personal training, like at other gyms, runs you about $40-$45 a sessions depending upon your package. Overall, the gym exudes a premium look and feel and the services and do live up to that image.",positive

David have helped me understand my form better and what to do with my workouts and I love gaining the understanding on what I need to do to help me with my bad knees.

I love this gym and all my friends go there and we absolutely LOVE our trainer Mark Olson! But they play Adel, James Blunt and other slow, depressing music. I love Adel and James Blunt, but not to work out to! Because I work with a trainer and read my iPad while I'm on cardio, I can't use my iPod to drown out the music. So...their music sucks. I love the employees and the daycare is awesome. Love the activities for kids. Love OSR being on site for my semi-frequent strains. Love the equipment. It's rarely out of order. I love the snack bar but would love to see a juicer! A juice bar would be awesome! Fix the dang music and you would almost be perfect.",negative

What the company does with them has nothing to do with me."" WOW. Never even asked what the company does with the fees, just what the different fees were. I wish there was another gym option close by.....",negative
"It's a gym so what can I say? I hate them. I hate having to go there. I think we should all by healthy & skinny always. Reality says that for a gym this one rocks. Super clean & the equipment is in great shape. The locker rooms are clean too. They have tanning, childcare, & a hair salon & chiropractor. Shawn is sales is the best & you should talk to him if you need a membership.",positive
"Finally getting around to my reviews. Got to give good ones where they are due! This gym made me into a gym rat and I enjoyed it. This place worked for me. I liked the laid back atmosphere and enjoyed seeing the many familiar smiling faces when I was there. I purchased trainer sessions when I first joined. I started with a trainer that really helped me overcome some of my sports injuries. I enjoyed the personal workouts and they imparted knowledge on various techniques. I continued with trainers for several years. I had to leave my trainer, Melanie when I moved and am still devastated.",positive
"I joined on a month-to-month plan in July, 2012. The gym is pretty good, no real complaints about the facility or staff. In September, they hit me with a $25 ""enhancement fee"" out of the blue. The claim from corporate billing was that this is in the contract. I don't remember anything about it, and I'm completely sure it was never pointed out by the guy that signed me up. So, they get $25 and lose the $40 a month I was paying for membership. Good for them. I don't do business that way, and I won't do business with anyone who does if I can help it.",negative
"I signed up here on March 2, 2012. I have been everyday except Friday, Sats and Suns since. I LOVE THIS PLACE! I hate the way I am so out of shape and how I am reminded of this every time I walk in, but by the time I walk out, I realize, that I am getting IN shape and that makes me love Mountainside. The gym is clean, the place is NEVER so busy that there aren't any machines or equipment available. The trainers are all really great. They build quick rapports with their clients and you feel good when you walk out knowing you got a GREAT workout in. The Ladies locker room and sauna are magnificent. The fees were reasonable and my husband joined with me at the same time so we saved quite a bit. Mountainside is doing the health business just right. Eli and Chris are great trainers, motivators, and fair guys. I highly recommend them for your first understanding of what training will consist of. Troy was our advisor who signed us up and he was really friendly and attentive to our discussion. I was worried about the kids aspect, but to be honest, not a problem at all. Right on Mountainside. Finally a Gym I can walk into and feel at home. I will continue my 4days a week for the next 6 months and when I jump into that size 4 bikini this summer, I am making sure to give Mountainside all the credit!",positive
"I was dying for a gym within 10 miles of here and finally got it. It had almost everything, a great selection of classes, lots of cardio machines, ample free weights and weight machines, basketball court, rock wall, child care, hair salon, tanning, massage services, sauna & steam rooms in the locker rooms, I am probably missing something. The only thing I think is missing is a lap pool. This gym opened in Nov, 2008. It's newer, well maintained and a great choice!",positive
"This place is absolutely terrible. The gym it self looks nice upon first going in, but the equipment in frequently out of order and rarely clean. They offer customers clean towels, but nothing to clean the equipment with after use. They're also thieves, with no real cancellation policy other then what they feel like telling you at that very moment. I tried to cancel do to the lack of hygiene in the place, and they told me I would forfeit my last months payment (never discussed in the contract) as well as pay 25% of what was left. This place really needs to step it up. I would not suggest that anyone waste their money here.",negative
"This location is one of the best run and most advanced gyms I have ever been to. I've been a member of every major gym in the Phoenix area and Mountainside Fitness (the CC location specifically) was nicely sized with plenty to do for everybody. There are other locations (phoenix/scottsdale) that are completely tiny and worthless unless you like waiting for weights, benches, and even machines.",negative
"I could not be happier with this gym! I think the price is incredibly fair for the amenities and how nice the facility is. As a stay at home mom (I have a 1.5 year old) I am especially impressed with the childcare. The ladies are so patient and kind. My daughter was scared at first, now reaches for the staff when we get in there. The best part is that they have cameras and you can watch your kiddos while you work out. Every time I'm there they are always cleaning and disinfecting all the toys. I love this place and I'm thankful to have somewhere I trust to leave my daughter.",positive
"I enjoyed going here for the few months I lived in Peoria. But after claiming you could quit any time, they made quitting impossible and were super shady about it. I filled out a form to cancel before I moved away. But I kept getting charges. For months. And threats about ""collections"". Jeez, you can see I haven't used the gym since I quit two months ago, what the hell? Danielle S, the manager, kept claiming since I didn't make a copy of my cancellation form it never happened. Strange, that was never an option when I filled it out! And demanding I come in person to fill out the form again! I moved away! In this day and age why on earth would someone have to physically drive to a location to fill out a form? Email it! Mail it! No reason. Just playing games to rack up charges while providing no services. Also known as...FRAUD. Technically. You know, legally, fraud. ARS 13-2310.",negative
"These people have no idea about common sense and logic. We had a group of 5 who wanted to try out mountainside fitness. We all have Arizona iD, except for one of us. We all live and work in AZ, including the one who didn't have an Arizona drivers license, and we offered proof that she worked and lived in Arizona. But they refused to let her try a 5day pass because she did not have an official Arizona drivers license. This makes no sense. She could prove that she works and lives in AZ, but they refused to let her join us. We are upset because she drove all the way from Scottsdale to go try it out with us, but they wouldn't let her in still even though she could prove that she both lives and works here. This place sucks I recommend going to absolutely any other gym",negative
"I was a member for over 2 years. I signed a personal training contract. Over the course of the past year I have been through 3 trainers who have quit or who were fired. The trainers were excellent and knowledgable. After the 3rd one left I was fed up with the turnover. I contacted the Arrowhead training manager to be let out of my remaining training sessions. My schedule had drastically changed after starting a new business and it was increasingly harder to make it on a regular basis. Add to that the thought of starting all over again with yet another trainer. I was told by the manager Brian that he would speak to the VP. After 3-4 emails to Brian I emailed the VP Mario. I emailed him twice about the situation at Arrowhead location. I explained my situation in detail. I NEVER got any response from either email. I also called VP Mario on 2 separate occasions, left a voice mail. Again NO response or call. I then called and asked to speak to the owner or president. I was told I could not have their emails. They told me Mario was the one to talk to about complaints or concerns. I explained that Mario had chosen to ignore all 4 of my attempts to contact him. I got one phone message from Mario and told him when I could be reached...no attempt was made on his part to reach me again. This is the final ( and 3rd) email I sent. I have NEVER gotten any response. WHAT A DISGRACEFUL COMPANY. Taking money for services not rendered, not responding to a member's concerns. I KNOW I am not the only one who has encountered this. SHAME ON YOU MOUNTAINSIDE FITNESS!!!! October 4, 2017 Mario - I am sorry I missed your call Monday afternoon at 3:45 p.m. I was in a meeting. I e-mailed you that I would be available after 4:15 p.m. I did not hear from you either via e-mail or phone. I also did not hear from you the next day to follow-up. To say that I am frustrated is an understatement. I have been trying to deal with and get resolution to my issues since August 14. I e-mailed back and forth with Brian with no results or true actions. On August 28 I decided to deal with you with the expectation that the VP would certainly be more concerned about his clientele and be professional in his actions and response times. I e-mailed you on August 28 and then about 5-7 days later. I received no acknowledgement that you had even read or received my e-mails and my concerns. I then called you on September 18 and left voicemail for you. I again called and left a voicemail for you on September 25. Again there was no response. So now it is 4 weeks since my communication efforts with you have started and 6 weeks since this entire situation started. I have asked to be refunded for my remaining 93 sessions and have just been told I could be provided another trainer. Brian said if I could not make my appointments he would have some resolution for me. ( That was the e-mail from late August ). Personal training, by nature, requires personal attention. The health and fitness industry is a service based industry. Clients need to feel they are valued, respected and have a positive and encouraging relationship with the trainer and the other gym personnel. Sadly this appears not to be the case or priority with Mountainside Fitness. How have your actions and your team members accomplished this? They haven't and you haven't. I feel like my concerns and my issues are being swept under the rug in hopes of it just going away. To have this as the culture in your managers and this company is so sad. This very poorly handled situation has fractured our client relationship beyond repair. There has been no respect, no efforts, and definitely no customer service. I can't truly believe that under these circumstances you will not honor my request. Would you really ask that I continue to work out in such a negative environment? Are you really going to keep the money for the services you could no longer provide me in a suitable manner? I simply want final resolution to this manner in the form of the refund for the 93 sessions. It has been 6 weeks with no efforts on the part of this company. Refunding the sessions will take very little effort on your part. If this cannot be resolved in accordance with what I am asking then I will have to pursue more formal avenues of resolution that will bring public awareness of the poor overall culture at this company. Sincerely, Leigh Ann Stastny",negative
Be very careful of fitness training. My trainer pushed my workout to the point where I had injury to my knees and back. In PT now and canceled membership and no reimbursement for unused training sessions.,negative
"Extremely poor customer service at this particular location. Treated like a number, not a member, when I brought my father (senior citizen from out of town) with me to workout. Very corporate feel with an emphasis on high pressure sales and zero flexibility for an old man that forgot to bring an ID with him. ""Member safety"" being quoted as policy and reasoning for 25 minute wait to get a sales pitch from member services. Manager could not think on his feet or provide any reasoning for the inconvenience, he could only recite policy like a corporate drone. My father is on record as having been a guest of mine in the past. Flexibility and doing what's best for the gym and the membership should be management's focus and what separates this gym from others. Not the case in this instance. Substandard treatment by staff and disappointing lack of flexibility and discretion by management.",negative
I've had a membership at just about every gym out there and this gym beats all of them. They always keep everything super clean and even though it's packed they have ample machines to be able to work out on! We go multiple times a week and the gym is always packed with people which says a lot about the fact people choose this gym over all others!,positive
"I came in to try this gym. I was filling out the waiver and info sheet and the asked for an ID. The front desk girl (who was nice) asked her manager, and she came out to inform me that i need an Arizona license. I just moved from out of state 2 days ago and the manager was rude and told me this info and said it would be $15 day fee and just walked away. I even had my new address in ARIZONA. I have ran and worked at gyms before and this was the worst gym experience I have ever had. They even have an option for one day pass and they still said I still need Arizona license. I will probably never be back to this gym. Based on the experience I had.",negative
"Paying to much money for a gym that's always packed. Tried bringing my daughter and they stated she needed an ID who brings their ID to the gym? I'm paying you money to be here and to be able to bring a guest. Find a better gym that's nots packed all day long. Equipment is never open, leaving this gym and going somewhere else that's cheaper and less packed. Look other places before coming here.",negative
"First, I'd like to start by giving positive feedback on the cleanliness of the facility. Most gyms are not very well taken care of. From the bathrooms to the main floor, the gym is picked up and amenities are typically stocked. The cons: The basketball gym; I signed up at this gym because of the full court gym. I often played there 2-3 nights a week. There was a good and loyal base of customers who would use the courts several nights a week, playing for hours at a time. After seeing them section off the full court gym to accommodate functional fitness really turned me off about this gym. If anything, the smarter thing would have been to add more machines, and more free weights. The gym is often extremely packed to where you are waiting on people to finish up on machines and benches. The carpet area is now used primarily used for stretching. The staff; outside of a few people that work the front, aren't friendly. Lastly, as minimal as this sounds; the gym is raising pricing on members. It's only a couple bucks in my certain situation but it's principle. Lvac in Las Vegas, is a gym I was loyal to for over 10 years and they honored and grandfathered my price that I signed up with them throughout my tenure. I live in the NW part of Peoria, and sadly there isn't another gym close to me. I would not recommend this gym to family or friends, and as soon as there is another gym nearby. I will take my business elsewhere.",negative
"This is easily the most disappointing Yelp review I have ever had to write. Myself, wife, and 2 kids have been members here at MSF for two years. We have referred at least a dozen other friends and couples here who have signed up and are now regulars. One of the greatest appeals that MSF had was that it didn't have the generic commercial feel of LA Fitness or 24 Hour Fitness. Most of the staff knew us by name, and it was a very welcoming place to go. Recently things have been changing. The final straw for us came yesterday afternoon when out of the blue we received a email from Danielle Jarrett, the newly appointed GM of the Lake Pleasant location, that they would be getting rid of the full basketball court. This was a pretty big blow to us seeing as myself and my 2 sons all play basketball here 3 times a week. It also doesn't take a lot of effort to read through your top Yelp reviews and realize that over half of them mention the full basketball court IN THEIR REVIEW! While the fact that the full court will be gone is disappointing, it's more disappointing that they made this decision without AT ALL considering to see what their members thought. That's not the same MSF that we signed up for and definitely not one we want to be a part of... Be warned if you are planning on signing up here that some of the amenities they use to draw you in may be gone in no time at all and you will have nothing to say about it.",negative
"I heard that they are closing the basketball full court, wish it was not true. We are disappointed as this is one of the gyms that has full court and consistent games during the week and the only reason some families sign up. If you are planning on signing up for the full court think twice as they will be renovating soon and is going away.",negative
"Fastest way to ruin your credit! Their collections team has a policy of immediately reporting delinquencies to collections EVEN BEFORE they bother to notify you of the deficiency. Technically legal, but shady....and is a gym really worth ruining your credit over? No other gym acts this way. Sign up at your own risk!",negative
"The instructors are excellent but have to rate it under three stars due to management. My husband went in three times to cancel his membership and the ""management"" was never available. I still go here but am disappointed with how horrible this place smells! Anytime of day or night! The ""filtered"" water tastes disgusting! The staff at the front desk is always chit chatting together and never gives eye contact when customers come in the door. Please clean the floors and machines more thoroughly. Maybe auto room deodorizers.",negative
"So much fun to work out here! I go early in the mornings and everyone is so nice! The front Desk clerk on Wed mornings - David, I think - is awesome! So much positive attitude! Just puts you in a good mood, right away!! My hubby goes after work and says it's pretty busy with all of the classes going on. So whatever you like....you'll find it here!!",positive
Love this gym! Childcare is amazing and Justin my personal trainer is awesome. Probably one of the best trainers I have ever had. He keeps things really interesting by always switching it up and being creative. He has been a great encouragement on my fitness journey.,positive
"I've been going to this gym on and off for about 5-6 years. I love this place. Staff is friendly, clean facility and the members are nice also! Classes are great and they have a great support system there too!!!",positive
"Music is way too loud !!! My husband bought me a $200 pair of Bose Noise Canceling HeadPhones and I still hear the music over my own music or TV program. The music doesn't make this gym inviting, it's a huge turn-off. Sadly, I don't think I will be renewing my membership.",negative
"You won't regret a membership here. Childcare is fantastic and a great feature for a gym. Equipment is top of the line. Full basketball court. Classes are a part of our membership. Locker rooms have nice showers, steam room and sauna. This place is killer!",positive
We mainly keep our membership because of the daycare. If you have kids (specifically babies or toddlers)you have to check this place out. It's worth the extra money. The classes are amazing and the equipment is a HUGE step up from LA fitness. Even the bathrooms are amazing. Seriously it's awesome :),positive
My family and I have been coming here for three years. They have childcare which helps us out tremendously when we need to come in and get our fitness on. The place stays pretty cool and the atmosphere is fantabulous it's never been too packed for me to workout here. I love that they updated the drinking fountains with an option to fill your water bottle. Very convenient.,positive
"I love this gym! The facility is always clean and nice. The childcare workers are amazing and my daughter just loves it here. I d not know many employees, however,the ones I do know have been so kind and helpful!!! Tj, the fitness director is really nice. he was patient and helped me with my goals and getting training set up- I saw Blake a few times and- WOW- what a workout. And heather was in childcare, now I see her all over- she is such a doll. I highly recommend this gym to ANYONE!",positive
Child care at this location is great! We love the classes that they offer. My only complaint would be that the classes are sometimes a bit crowded; I wish they'd offer more classes to reduce the sizes of the classes.,positive
"This is a place you can go and do activities to lose weight. Or you can bulk up and learn how to bench press cars or crush boulders. I mean the choice is yours. It's dope tho cuz you can like lift weights or do some cardio on the machines. They got a basketball court too but some people be real good like they are trying out for the NBA, so I just wait till their done and shoot a bunch of air balls but look good doing it. Oh and you can like tan or use their steam room which is cool unless and old guy gets naked then it's just weird. Probably don't eat a pizza after you get done working out like I did, but that's just me, I don't conform to societies rules.",positive
"I have been coming to this gym for over a year now. I have lost a total of 125 lbs with the help of my awesome trainer, Blake!!! I never feel intimidated or out of place here. I would highly recommend the core concept trainers. They have helped me change my life!!",positive
"I don't go to Mountainside Fitness for working out, but I do use their Chiropractor there for a long time. Never have I walked in the door without the staff giving me a super friendly greeting and being extremely helpful. The place is always super clean, too, with plenty of trainers around to help. I have a great impression of this place from what I've seen.",positive
gotta love mountianside .. i go the surprise one. but been to this one many times. they are very nice and i feel welcomed when i go :),positive
Great gym and awesome kids club. You won't feel bad about leaving your kids in this club while you work out. They even have a bouncey house for the kids,positive
"Wow I don't know where to begin. Convenient location for us out in the boonies of Peoria, beautiful facilities, classes are free, blow dryers in the bathrooms are amazing, tvs everywhere....seriously changed my life. I lost 20 pounds going to this gym. Worth every penny.",positive
"I would recommend reading the reviews of the other locations and see how people are promised one thing when they sign up only to have it change when it is time to renew their contract. Prices going up over $180 a year after being told their ""price for life"" to being nickel and dimed to use separate pieces of equipment. Do research!",negative
"I been going for 5 years to this location, most class and instructors are good. But not all instructors are good I just say. some are terrible. I used to love to take saturday morning classes with teacher name Tea, awesome instructor she always make each class fun and different. but now they replace her with a new teacher name Connie, which I really don't understand why is she teaching a class, she make the class a lot more challenge, not everyone is able to do the posture and half of the class is not able to catch up, she may think she is very good, but she definite is not a good teacher. Hopefully the owner is able to replace a better teacher then Connie.",negative
"This is my favourite Yoga studio in the Markham/Richmond Hill area. It started out as a Moksha Yoga, but I love the improvements that the owners have made since it became My Yoga Studio. I feel like they kept the best of the facility and great instructors. But they tweaked the format of the classes to enhance the learning experience of the yogis and yoginis looking to advance in their practice. I always feel able to try something new and challenging here. With Moksha, you are very limited. I find the yoga instructors here to be very encouraging and supportive for people who want to take their practice to the next level. Another thing I like about the classes here is the variation in temperature according to each style of yoga. It's these little attentions to detail that I love.",positive
"A disapointing experience here. After hearing great reviews online I drove to the Richmond Hill location hoping to try it out only to be turned away with a unsympathetic ""no"" from two kids for being 3 minutes late the to class. I know policy is policy. But businesses don't succeed with poor customer service. By all means this place could be the greatest yoga studio. I simply had a horrible experience.",negative
"Signed up for a one month community appreciation program from Appreciation Events. Great deal with a one month unlimited pass and buy one get one ten class pass for $20.99. Thus far, I've sampled classes at various times during the day, from 6:30am classes to 8pm classes and found that 4:30 classes is the best time with fewest people ( I think once there were maybe 13-15 people). Likely because it's an awkward time for the employed, but I'm taking advantage of my month working from home! The studio itself is well maintained, but a rubber mat is recommended if you're planning on becoming a serious hot yogi to combat slipping on mat during class and focus 100% on your poses. Staff are friendly. My favourite classes so far are with Bonnie. Overall, a warm and rejuvenating environment for you to get away, get toned, and get relaxed.",positive
"Recently signed up for the one month unlimited membership to try out all the different classes. The change room (I can only provide comments for the ladies side) and studio room are both generally clean; with exception of one of the Sunday Vinyasa class at noon where the studio room floor was not mopped (I believe and hope that it was a one off). I also wish that the change rooms would have lockers so that I can store my belongings in a more secure place. I really enjoy the 8pm hot classes as there is less people and works great with my schedule. I find that I can really a great workout while feeling more relaxed. The studio also offers 6pm economy classes for $9, Monday, Wednesday and Friday which makes practicing yoga more economical as we all know how expensive it can get. Overall great experience and would recommend anyone interested to practice yoga to try this studio out.",positive
"I have been practicing yoga for about 3 years now and have tried different studios. I almost lost my interest in yoga after about a year in another Moksha studio because it was very repetitive and boring. Then I bought a passport for prana pass and tried MYRH and the rest is history. This studio has kept me going mainly because no 2 classes are the same, even if it's the same teacher. If you like challenges, this is the studio to come to.",positive
"I have been to a few yoga studios... this one has my heart! Anyone with a love for yoga and a passion to try to take the practice off the mat.. .this place is for you! Awesome teachers, space and community! I have definitely found a studio that deepens my love for yoga every time I take a class.",positive
"I needed a good diversion as I ended my tournament season, recover from injury, and quiet the mind. Then, I tried Moksha RH since it's so close to my house and one I haven't tried before. I took the Introductory Offer of $40 unlimited for 30 days last March and I just got hooked to his place. I've been coming regularly since, 3-4x/wk. The #1 reason? TEACHERS. Rockstars and angels, they are simply a bunch of outstanding instructors. They're all highly experienced and effective. I just love the way they help us build and understand the foundation for each pose. Reminders, tips, queues, personal pose adjustments, philosophy - excellent guidance through the practices. Their leadership in each class are just brilliant. I have a list of awesome teachers, and it adds up so often. PM me so I can tell you how they're generally like. I have my faves too! This should help you one way or another. The other reason is SPIRITUALITY. From my practices years ago, I have learned that Yoga is first and foremost a practice for the mind & spirit. And the Moksha RH teachers never ignored nor neglected this aspect of the practice. In fact, they emphasize it, which to me is a total coolness factor. Found my sanctuary that offers a good variety of CLASSES - another reason to love this place - those I totally dig and absolutely love. The frequency of each class type also helps with my desired number of practices each week with favorable schedules. Students vary in levels and personal purpose of doing yoga here. And the teachers are mindful enough to adjust their pace and difficulty level depending on the class that gather at that time. Sometimes, there are too many binds and handstands; sometimes mostly stretch, reach, and bends. However it goes, I get my waterfall of sweat and oh-yeah's. So I come to class without expectations, just follow the flow/breath, and focus on what I can do. They also have many relevant workshops every month with experienced and highly esteemed teachers and healers. I love their website. Go check it out. The CULTURE of kindness, humility, and politeness without prejudice nor aggression to push you out of your limits are very motivating. I find the students here are practically happy that they can laugh and smile at their own fumble-and-tumble (i'm one of 'em), and kind enough to tell you hey its the left foot not the right with a smile. The teachers make jokes or positive remarks making each class fun yet serious hard work. I've tried almost all classes and scheds except for the weekday early morning of 6:30, and they're all good. Some classes can get so packed regardless the time. But it's NOT always like that. The weather is sometimes a good indication. LoL They have a single studio with a maximum capacity of 40 adults, maybe 45 if the mat spacing are adjusted properly. Yes, I actually counted like an engineer. I dunno why but it should serve a good purpose in this review. Anyway, the heating/ac in the studio is good, love the huge windows and lights in the studio which they adjust according to the intensity of the practice (light affects our state of mind, after all), musing on the calming and earthy interior, sufficient dressing room, and super nice & friendly customer relations. No worries about parking spaces. Moksha RH: a sanctuary, a church, a haven, a good place.... There's just so much love in here, man. :D",positive
"Moksha yoga is based on a standard set of poses, this is good for building strength but they offer variety with Flow classes and Ashtanga. Also, some instructors such as Todd and Heather add in variety and a beautiful flow to the Moksha series with different postures. Some teachers will invite you to advance or modify poses based on your own comfort within your practise. Vikram has a calming and wonderful way of instructing. I signed up with Markham but I frequent here a couple of nights a week, I do this for variety and for what fits my schedule. I am very particular about the style of my instructor. I like to be challenged, I want a great sequence of poses and I rely on the instructor for their guidance. The studio is large enough, it's very clean, the change room is notably large for a yoga studio, 4 showers which is impressive. I have never had a feeling of unwelcome, this is yoga! Scanning is easy, there's on-line sign up and perk rewards. I would definitely recommend Moksha.",positive
"We love this studio. It's not as updated as Maple location, but there are 6 showers in the ladies change room, which is greate, as you don't have to wait in line. I love the classes. Our favourite is YuMee Chun's Jivamukty classes on Friday night and Sunday, with live music. These are AMASING!!! Thanks YuMee and Moksha!",positive
I have a girlfriend who is a member at this location and was raving about it so I decided to give it a try since there was a Groupon for it. I'm running back to Yoga Tree! Here's what I did not like: 1. No lockers 2. Tried 4 different instructors and found them all to be poor. One instructor did not correct anyone. Just walked around and talked. Another instructor randomly corrected people (two people side by side were doing the exact same thing wrong and only one got corrected) Another instructor kept walking all over my mat. There was tons of room (about 15 people in class) and I don't mean they caught the corner walking by. They walked right onto my mat with both feet. Several times! I even moved my mat and they still walked on it! Why??? The other instructor was so so. I've had better yoga instructors at the gym. 3. Location. The location is a nightmare to get in and out of during rush hour. During non rush hour it takes me 10 mins but during rush hour it's more like 30-45 mins! 4. Classes are not difficult. These are good if you're a beginner or beginner/intermediate. 5. Different class levels are not offered. Which would be fine if instructors would give different options. Have not experienced this. Here's what I did like 1. The showers were nice and big 2. Bolsters and cushions available in class 3. Lots of parking available,negative
"I've been trying to find a yoga studio that offers a decent amount of Ashtanga classes since I can't take the heat (I get ridiculously dizzy which makes me want to curl into a fetal position not a child's pose). Richmond Hill has 3 classes a week at convenient times so I signed up. During the week is one instructor (Eric) and on the weekend it's someone else (I have yet to attend a weekend class...something always comes up!). I haven't done Ashtanga for a few months now but Eric is pretty good instructing the class and walking around occasionally to correct people's poses. I enjoy them as they're challenging and varies. The studio itself if pretty nice. The changer room is clean and goes by honour system since they don't have lockers yet. I was advised by the front desk that they're coming soon. You can leave your purse with the front desk if you want so it's not an issue. While the change room is small, people are generally good at changing quickly so it has never been an issue for me. Looking forward to a weekend Ashtanga class...",positive
"Moksha Yoga Richmond Hill is in a building I saw being built back a few years ago when I was still working within the area. I noticed that this is the first Yoga Studio that has large clear-view windows so everyone outside can see how I do my Flippin' Downward Dog. I noticed the lady next to me was really scared I'll give her a Windmill Kick in her face instead. She's still alive and eating. :P I guess in case of any emergencies, the Fireman from the Fire Hall a few steps away can always walk over and give anyone here Mouth-to-Mouth. The interior setting and bench has a lot of Drift/Natural Wood variety elements. The M washroom seemed average as I shared it with myself with 1 Washroom and 1 Shower area w/2 Shower heads. Awww, how intimate? The Studio space was large and must have fitted the 25+ of us perfectly but anything beyond that would have us kissing feet. The instructor was quite good with all explanations and the emphasis on ""Opening up the Collar Bone"" as today's focus. I guess probably as the lone Rookie and non-weekly local, the instructions and transition from pose-to-pose was slightly quicker for me, but perfect for everyone else. She wasn't the ""Technical"" type as she commented herself so we did the whole session Au-Naturel. That didn't mean we were doing Yoga nude, it just means we went without any soothing Music until the ending sleepy resting pose, my FAV.",negative
"Moksha Yoga Richmond Hill underwent a major facelit and renovation The waiting area, the change room and the practice room itself all double in spaces! New floorings, new fixture, almost new everything. Now the practice room has much better lighting than before, the floor to ceiling windows does let a lot of nature light comes in the room on a nice sunny day. The floor now are wooden panelled flooring. The lady change room now has 4 showers with wooden partitions, 2 hair dryers and 2 sinks! And they also installed a water machine out in the waiting room instead of having the filtered water from the only sink they have previously! Disappointment is there still no locker facilities. I also like how they expand their schedules in offering more non Moksha series classes! The Reduced Heat Vinysa Flow class I attended using my Passport to Prana was excellent. Lynda the instructor was really patient in explaining all the poses and walking around doing adjustments for us! She walked around the whole room and make sure everyone doing the asanas properly!! Great energy! Great class! There are also complimentary fresh fruits at the receptionist area where you are welcome to have a healthy snack before or after the class. They are still working on putting more finishing touches to the studio. I can't wait to see how it will be when everything is done.",positive
I think the pool and locker rooms could be better maintained. The pool looks like it has a bathtub ring. I find it expensive for seniors who are not on Silver Sneakers programs. We encourage our elderly to stay active yet make it cost prohibitive for them to join. $45 for a one person senior membership is too high.,negative
"Love the instructors and the exercise classes! Clean and friendly facility. A bit expensive relative to other clubs. Overcrowded at times and in need of more dumbbells and equipment for classes so members don't have to search the entire facility looking for 8 lb. weights, balls, etc. The. new mats are great! Comfortable atmosphere; feels like home.",positive
"I love the atmosphere! The staff is helpful and friendly. The equipment is well maintained. However, the staff should make themselves more visible in the equipment area and remind people to wipe off equipment they use with the provided disinfectant. It wastes time for me to wipe equipment down BEFORE I use it just to make sure I don't pick up someone else's germs and get sick.",negative
"If you're really into fitness I do not recommend this place. The free weight area is small and the other two areas are always taken with classes or by the staff having a meeting. I actually have pencils that have rougher nurals than the YMCA barbells which, by the way, are smooth as butter. The profile picture of this place on yelp IS LITERALLY THE STAFF HAVING A MEETING IN ONE OF THE TWO ONLY ROOMS WHERE YOU CAN WORKOUT IN. I even got kicked out because they were ""closing"". Like yeah, I get it was close to the time they close at but guess what. They weren't closed. Like I have at least a solid 5 minutes left, hop off. On the holidays they have scavenger hunts with kids running around the entire place with tables of free pizza cookies desserts whatever, you name it. I'm trying to make gains not be tempted into flavorful, tasty good food that will kill me. If you're a gym rat go somewhere else. You don't even have to be a gym rat you can just be someone who's starting get serious about fitness. If you got kids it's a good place to go for the children don't get me wrong. And don't worry, all you'll have to spend is all of their saved-up tuition money because the Y has you pay for a membership that costs more than every other gym ever. They won't be able to get good, well-paying jobs, but they sure will have the privilege of getting to say that they paid $50-$60 a month to go to a less than mediocre gym. The YMCA is family friendly, not athlete friendly. Y, you shall take this one star.",negative
"This is a great gym for families! Yes, I can understand how this gym is very expensive compared to other gyms in the area. It is! But, it is geared towards families. If you are not a family or a senior citizen and you're not going to utilize all of the extra curricular activities that they have, but this is probably not the gym for you. It is very expensive even for families but I highly recommend it",positive
. My son has ADHD and was put in summer camp due to some behavioral issues he was kicked out of the program. I was disappointed but understood. I decided to enroll him this year hoping that the YMCA would help to teach positive behavior. My son had 1 incident with another child due to movkingl and bullying. My son continued to tell the kids to stop until he was so upset. I do not condone any negative behavior but I don't feel it was up to my son to get the other children to stop. Where are the counsellors to immediately diffuse the situation. Due to that 1 incident my child was immediately removed from the program permanently. Mind you there was no physical harm to anyone. The reason they say he was removed was because of his previous behavior from the year prior. This is extremely disappointing. I believe every child should start every school year with a new slate. I feel as if he started with a target on his back and branded from day 1. My son had no chance from the moment he stepped into camp. Such a shame. These are children....,negative
"Nice Gym, however compared to other gyms in the area it is way too expensive. You can go to FX Fitness,Dynamic,Fitworks, and other gyms for 15-20$ a month. You can go to Planet Fitness for 10 bucks in Parma. The YMCA charges close to 50 a month and the only additional feature is really the basketball court and pool.....FX has a pool too for half the price",negative
"Get ready all you NR members, the Y has decided to honor the closed Ridge Road Y memberships, nothing against the people from Parma its just that this already tightly scheduled facility will be even more packed and overcrowded during peak times. Nearby is the ugly, boxy glass county library which used to be a mostly NR facility...it was to have been remodeled and expanded at its former sight, but the Mayor wanted his city hall there. Now the NR taxpayers subsidize the Y building which was a former defunct party center, and through tax dollars maintain the building and service it. The parking there is already a fiasco and will only be worse. When the first opened this Y, I called to ask about rates for NR residents and they were very steep. They offered only a small 5 or 10% discount compared to nonresidents and they wanted a credit card or checking for automatic monthly or quarterly withdraws...really? I found a better rate and facilities at the Seven Hills Rec Center, because as soon as these community rec centers (albatrosses) run into money-maintenance issues they will slash their non-resident fees, which seven hills did and it was cheaper than the resident fees at NR - family Y. Brecksville has the best set up, no regionalism nonsense or leases. The community that supports it and subsidizes it are the only ones allowed to use their rec center. They do not offer non-resident membership, nonresidents can only come as one guest of a resident. Good luck getting open swim time and bb courts.",negative
"I've been a member at this Y for a year now. It's very clean and well kept, but there is much room for improvement. You have to be careful at what time you go there during the summer months because the basketball courts are closed for a kids camp until 4:30 and other workout rooms are closed for meetings some days of the week. This is very frustrating because I am paying a full membership fee to use basically a third of the facility. If you're looking for a family oriented gym then go here but if you want to be able to utilize a variety of aspects of a gym, I wouldn't recommend this place.",negative
Came to shoot hoops as a guest with my brother and was only allowed to use a portion of the gym...probably the dumbest rule I've ever heard. Either it's an Ohio thing or the director of this gym is just str8 up pathetic. If you want a nice gym for you and your guests go somewhere else,negative
"The Y is new, clean, and in a very convenient location right near the library. They have a wide variety of exercise equipment, treadmills, and classes available. I do enjoy a good deal of the group workout classes... Zumba is always a lot of fun (if you're looking for a GREAT workout, go to one of Dana or Terryn's classes!) and spinning is a great choice as well! There are definitely regulars in these classes so there's a nice group dynamic going on and it's fun to workout with people you know. It's also great to have a pool in which you can swim laps! As a ""swammer"" (former swimmer), I still like to get in the pool every once in awhile. Those are the pros. As far as cons go, I wish there was a bigger variety of class times and types. Barre classes are great, but that class has been discontinued. I'd also like to try Pilates, hot yoga, and other trendy classes. It's also slightly irritating to go to a class scheduled with one teacher but be surprised with a less-than-desirable one (I have walked out of Zumba with Alyssa... There's no point to stay in a class where there's no energy!). Finally, the pool schedule is so tightly packed, it's hard to find open swim times. Overall, the NoRo Y is a great, convenient place to work up a sweat and I'll keep coming back!",negative
"I've been a member here since it first opened a couple years ago and it's very nice/new/clean, but it is very expensive especially for a Y. I'm not sure what classes are free but we signed our 6 month up for water babies class which cost money and was very disappointing. The pool is ice cold and they have no control over the water temperature it seems and that's the only pool. Secondly the girls teaching the water babies class were less than enthused about it and seemed more like open swim at times. Most of the kids cried bc it was entirely too cold and some had to leave the pool after turning blue. For baby/kids swim lessons I'd highly recommend the swim of things in North Royalton, it's definitely their passion and they have a heated indoor pool (but facilities ie changing area is very primitive...sheets hanging on string and they yell at you if you don't take your towel too the pool, kinda odd but they are good at teaching.",negative
"Best gym in Vegas, super clean, never too crowded, has a shower which makes it really easy to workout in the mornings and then head to work. If you're looking for a friendly and clean gym this is definitely the spot! Oh and the staff are great as well! Thanks JB, Theresa, and Ross!",positive
I've visited alot of gyms and this one is my favorite by far! The owners are so friendly and JB is very knowledgeable when it comes to forming the correct workout to meet your fitness goals! Open gym is supplied with plenty of equipment so there is never a wait. One of the best qualities about this gym is it's very CLEAN! I highly recommend this gym to anyone in the area!,positive
Great gym with a more intimate setting without the intimidation of having 150 people crammed into a warehouse. Simple rates with no gotcha fees.,positive
"If you're looking for a gym in Vegas, seriously look no further than Open Gym Fitness! 5 Star Gym all around! It is an easy, convenient local gym to get to. Open 24 hours too! No dealing with crowds like you'd find in any mainstream gym where you're constantly waiting for equipment. Even better-extremely affordable for what you receive when you come here!! Squat racks, medicine balls, kettlebells, TRX bands, Olympic lifting platforms, brand new set of turf, free weights and so much more! The gym is also a month to month commitment which is great! The owners, Ross and Teresa, are amazing people! You'll always see them around the gym chatting with members, giving out support, or even working out with everyone! You can tell they are owners who really care about making everyone's gym experience a great one every single time they walk through those doors. Their trainer, JB, is equally as phenomenal!! I've worked out in many different gyms, seen many different trainers, and no one interacts with and truly cares about their clients as much as JB does. Ive been apart of the group sessions he coaches Monday- Friday for about a month now, and I'm hooked! He took the time to learn my goals, and help me with my nutrition. In a little less than a month I've gained 2.2lbs of muscle and lost 4.1lbs of fat with the help of this gym! I could never write enough positive things about this gym- definitely make this gym your top pick!!",positive
Open gym is the ideal gym for anyone ! It's 24 hours & equipped with most of your needs! I hope they open up more !!!!! Jb was such a nice guy when looked around there !!!! So Knowledgeable & welcoming !!! Open gym is my new favorite gym!!!!!,positive
"Perfect gym to get in and workout. Never packed. Like a Crossfit gym without the price and always open. Seriously check this gym out!!! Pros: Awesome owners Power racks always available Two oly stations Benches and dumbbells going up to 100lbs Two rowers, 3 treadmills, and some other misc cardio equipment Sled and area to push inside Boxing bag Did I mention power racks always available? Open 24/7 and never packed. Month to month with no commitment AND priced very well (cheaper than 24) Cons: Very few. The only thing I wish they had was a machine for leg extensions/curls, but given the abundance of barbells and price, it's a very small inconvenience.",positive
"What happens when a neighborhood gym evolves into the absolute apex of gym experiences? This. The best gym, you will ever set your mortal eyes upon. Thinking about it now i'm not even sure it really exists, it's too perfect, like a stunning mirage in the desert. The gym itself has everything you will ever need to help you lose fat, get strong, and crush whatever your goals have. Locally owned and operated, the owners are the friendliest people you'll ever meet and express care towards their members. I'm relatively new to working out so I was a bit nervous a year ago, first coming in. But after coming in, talking to the owners, seeing the gym, and taking a few personal training sessions it really helped kick-start me into the world of Fitness and leading a healthier lifestyle. Also, you'll get to look ripped, so there's that. There's no contracts and no hidden fees, just an excellent gym. So if you're reading this review and even thinking about it, you're almost there, this is it, the Elysian Fields, fitness paradise. If you like bad gym's, this isn't for you.",positive
Amazing place to get a workout in. I'm a drop in from out of town and needed some open gym time to do my programming. Owner was really nice and the place had everything I needed for Olympic weight light and I was able to get my CrossFit workout on which included the airdyne. I highly recommend this place. Pretty cool idea. 24 hour open fitness center that isn't a body building gym.,positive
"I love this place! I was sick of paying crossfit prices and honestly could not make all the scheduled times. I am happy that this place is available to you 24 hours. The equipment is very good quality. I can do oly lifts, power lifts, crossfit and more. Very impressed with this place and appreciate the cleanliness and the kindness of the owners.",positive
"How do you know if you'll like OGF? If you answer yes to any of the following questions: 1. Are you a nomadic gym traveler, rotating from gym to gym to gym, in search of things unseen? 2. Are you into functional fitness? You want to kip your pull ups in peace, push the sled without judgment? Slam the med balls, climb your rope, jerk that clean, or curl in the squat rack? 3. Do you want to have a photo shoot with a bunch of ropes to bump your Instagram follower count without interruption? 4. Do you work an odd Las Vegas hour job, and can't be confined to 10PM closing time of regular gyms? 5. Do you hate LVAC/24? 6. Do you like a help yourself fruit bowl? 7. Do you want a platform so you can chase your Olympic dreams in Rio De Janerio however unlikely the outcome? 8. Do you like mom and pop businesses? 9. Do you like to work out in an almost empty almost all the time gym? Sign OGF like I did at $34.95 month to month with no start up fees or termination fees. See you there (or never).",positive
"Nice cozy gym with all the bells and whistles! The owners are very friendly, helpful, and receptive. No contracts, no hidden fees, and everything a gym should be. In the words of Peyton Manning, ""I like it"".",positive
Awesome gym. Great staff. Great environment. No hidden fees or contracts. Good for beginners up to advanced training. Very clean and well maintained equipment.,positive
"My wife and I have been working out at OPEN GYM for a few weeks now and we always feel welcome at the facility. The equipment, which is always clean, is brand new and top notch. The owners Ross and Teresa are such friendly people and they really know how to make you feel comfortable when you walk through their doors. You definitely won't feel like you're ""just another member"" at this gym. The environment is much different than LVAC and other big gyms. I'd highly recommend 1-on-1 training with Ross because his attention to detail is superb and he breaks things down in a very effective and easy to understand manner. We joined because of the fair prices and convenience (5 mins from home), but we soon learned there are plenty more reasons to sign-up. You won't regret it.",positive
"Great teachers and classes! Always friendly and helpful. Haven't tried any other otf in the Phoenix area, only in NorCal.",positive
"I have been a member of Orange Theory Fitness for 7 years now and still love every minute of it! After 7 years and I still have not had the same workout twice. I love that there is a new workout and new challenge every day. I started attending the Scottsdale location which was the first in the state of Arizona back in 2011. All in all, I have attended 10+ different studios across the valley as well as others out of state. Camelback and their sister studios (Central Phoenix and Arcadia) are great! The desk staff is super friendly and helpful, especially Maddie at the Camelback location. I was having issues with my heart monitor for a while and other studios (I tend to pop around a lot) were helpful in giving me a loaner for the class, but it did not resolve the issue. It was only a temporary fix. Maddie went above and beyond and spent time troubleshooting with my heart monitor and charger while I was in class until she figured out a solution for me. Top notch customer service! #ibleedorange",positive
"First workout!! I feel like Jello, but can't wait to go back!! Everyone was so nice and friendly and willing to work around my physical limitations!",positive
"OTF has changed my life in ways I can't explain. At 48 years old, I have never been athletic, hated running, and was putting on more and more weight. In the five months I've been attending Orangetheory, I've lost 30 pounds, I feel better than I've ever felt in my life, I'm happier, my friends are noticing a difference, I am actually starting to sign up for competitive runs and obstacle course races. I can't even begin to thank this amazing company for the things they've done for my life! Do yourself a favor and check it out!",positive
"Honestly, the workout is great but the policies and front desk staff made this a bad experience. I'm a member that brought my boyfriend in to try a class and 30 minutes before they started texting him saying he was too late to start and that he could come back a different day. We ended up getting there 15 minutes before and they said he could not do the class for ""safety reasons."" Sorry, but it takes 2 minutes for the instructor to walk you through class and 5 minutes to fill out the paperwork (which ended up being their safety excuse). Like I said, great workout but for the cost of membership Im really frustrated by the customer service. There is a new location opening up that I signed up for and am just using this location temporarily and I hope the other one opens soon.",negative
"The instructors and all staff are awesome. They take the time to discuss your fitness goals and learn your name. Even as a previous college athlete, I am being pushed harder than I have been in a while!",positive
"This was my first time visiting this location. I usually go to the one downtown since it's close to work. The facility is pretty awesome, looks and feels bigger than the downtown location. Their quiptment looked pretty new too. My workout was with Nic,he was great! Hands on, very motivating. Front desk staff were super friendly and helpful.",positive
"This OT is by far my favorite of the 3 in my neighborhood. The coaching staff is phenomenal, the front desk staff is amazingly friendly and the equipment, lobby and bathrooms are super clean. I used to dread going to the gym and now, I have to force myself to take a rest day! Every workout is challenging in different ways and after four months of attending, I'm faster, leaner and stronger than I was, or would ever be working out on my own. If you haven't tried OTF yet, check them out, you'll be hooked!",positive
Visited this location for the first time while the Arcadia location moves and I must say I really love this location! Jenny was absolutely AMAZING! I'm even thinking about driving the extra bit just to attend her classes each week even when my new location opens! Thanks for the awesome class!!!,positive
"The trainers are so knowledgable and very motivating. They are extremely friendly and fun. My form has been corrected several times, its like having a personal trainer. My fitness level has definitely improved and I've been able to adjust my workout accordingly. They have a very accommodating schedule. I always feel accomplished when I'm done.",positive
"The workouts can be CHALLENGING. BUT, it's all at your own pace. So although they encourage everyone to give their 100% effort, that will look different from person to person. I was hesitant to try it at first but it's by far the most effective workouts I've done. There is no way I would push myself as hard as I do if I was just on my own. They check in on you throughout and make sure you're comfortable and effective. I also love that you can see real time how many calories you're burning and how accurate it is. This location is my favorite one because they are open later than some other locations which gives me more class options to attend. Pros: Great workout, helpful staff, extended hours, clean Cons: May be a bit pricey for some people",positive
"It's the best workout, and the only one I've ever been able to stick with. I've tried so many different workouts over the years, and I end up losing interest. Orangetheory always mixes it up to keep things interesting, and you can never plateau since it adjusts based on your current fitness level.",positive
Love love love OTF! I've been an active member for nearly 4 years. It was my first time visiting this studio. I had a great workout with Trainer Kristi! She keeps the class motivated and moving! I would highly recommend this studio and of course a workout with Kristi!,positive
Worst ever!!! My 13 year old kid could run that place better! I've tried to cancel my membership for 3 months now and they keep charging me! I don't understand what's so hard about cancelling a membership when I provided the necessary forms after someone told me over the phone before all this that I didn't need to do anything!!,negative
"I was referred to Orange Theory by a friend. I decided to take the free trial class and was immediately hooked. I love the fact that the staff is so positive and truly motivating. I finished my class expecting to be bombarded with a sales pitch and nope, the girl at the front desk asked if I had any questions about the session or memberships...totally casual. I loved that!!! It was nice not being hounded to buy a membership like other gyms. It's nice because with the membership, you can go to other locations. I definitely recommend OT Ashley and Kristi are awesome!!!",positive
"I was sick of my general workout routine and needed to change it up. So many people have told me about Orange Theory, and I'm glad I finally tried it! I'm hooked!! Love this location and the trainers are amazing. Always a great workout!",positive
I love this location! Everyone is so friendly and welcoming. It is by far the best one hour workout you can have! Every trainer that trains here it's awesome and definitely knows what they are doing! Go orange!,positive
"If I could give zero stars then I would but since I can here's the deal. I signed up for the trial and after reassessing my monthly budget, cancelled. I was then charged $164 after already canceling. My money was refunded after a couple phone calls and I was then told that the 'system' created two accounts for me and where one was cancelled the other remained active and that is why I was still charged. Weird, but okay, I got my money back and didn't think of it since. Until this past Thursday 8/25 when looking at my bank account online I see a charge from OraneTheory Fitness for $79! What! So I call and am assured that the manager will take care of it. So I call back the next day to address the status on the refund and the manager has not seen the note yet but am assured again that it will be taken care of. So I call the next day and get the voice mail and no one called me back. You better believe I will be calling again, if not showing up and demanding this be resolved. For such a seasoned company you would think they would have issues like this taken care of asap. Obviously not. I have worked with other OT locations in the past and have never had issues. This location needs help.",negative
"This is my 'home' OTF. It is brand new and just opened in July. Today, after vacationing and eating all around the world.. I finally showed up for my beating. I have now worked out at a few OTF places in the valley, my most frequent is Central, where I got hooked by amazing Emily. I was sad when Emily left for Florida, but she's moving up in the OTF world. I had a few minor issues at Central, mainly with being told one thing regarding my daughter and a temporary membership, ( there are no contracts at OTF and that is the amazing thing about them.. ) and the pod/wrist band usage. NOT a reason to get mad and give up what works for my body and is fun, though! Keep pushing! Fast forward and we are here at Camelback Colonnade! It's new and shiny and our trainer, Richard, was amazing, encouraging and awesome! He may be on point with Emily ... as he made my daughter and I feel welcome here and guided us along. We aren't rookies to OTF, but no one would know that today... As I've mentioned in my other review for OTF Central, THIS isn't for pansies ! This workout will work you and work you good! You get cardio in blocks on the treadmill with running or power walking .. move to rowers .. move to the weight room and in an hour that goes pretty quick, mind you, you have burned 500-600 calories and later ... your heart will thank you! The treadmills here at this location have fans... ahhh! I love that, as I've been to the others and getting the treadmill in the 'right' area where the ac or fans from above hit you .. becomes key! No need to worry here at Camelback Colonnade! This place is clean and the front desk staff is nice too... that again, isn't necessarily the case ALL the time at other locations. If you haven't had your dose of citrus yet .. try it. Make your fat scream!",positive
"I will always and forever encourage people to try OrangeTheory! It's a tough workout, do not get me wrong, but it's one of the best out there. I travel a lot so I really appreciate that I'm able to go to different locations but still get great consistency! Coaches here at OTFSC are incredible! I take early morning classes and Michelle is always encouraging us to bring our best to our workout and leave being the best humans we can be. ""Be kind to one another"" It's just the perfect way to start your day! If you've been thinking about trying out OTF- go for it!",positive
"Pretty unprofessional staff, particularly upper management. They seemed okay at first but the more interactions I had with them the more I realize that the company hires really unqualified people who aren't able to do anything except sell. I definitely will never go back to OTF at any location due to their complete unprofessionalism.",negative
"Yup, it's real. All the hype, all the radio promos, friends talking about it, it's legit. Second workout done and love everything about it. We were very intimidated as we haven't worked out in so long but that wasn't an issue once the class started. It's the real deal, go check it out!",positive
"The trainers (Kenpo, Michelle, Kyle, Sunny, Rob), the interval training variety, THE MUSIC, the energy of a crowded class of people working hard!!",positive
"I love everything about Orangetheory! From the moment I walk in the door, I know I am going to have a great workout. Every trainer there motivates me to push harder. Nothing else compares!",positive
I like having a leader to direct me through the routines. I also like the fact you are never waiting for a machine. The hour is maximized so I get the most benefit of my time spent exercising.,positive
"Very clean, upbeat, fun and organized! Love it! The price is a little high but it's worth it when you see your results as they are happening.",positive
"I have been attending this location for almost 4 months. The girls at the front desk are always super friendly and helpful. I have attended almost all of the coach's classes and even though they all have a different style, they are always willing to help with form and technique. Love this place!!!",positive
Awesome trainers and staff who are committed to helping you enjoy your workout experience and reach your goals. Member for 1 year. Best workout!,positive
"Workout lasted 48 minutes, not 60. The guy leading our workout never corrected our form once (which I'm sure our form was wrong since we were new) and ignored me when I tried to get his attention to ask a question. He never asked how we were doing or if we had any questions. He had a gut and was out of shape. He had a pompous attitude and I'm not even quite sure he knew how to do the exercises correctly because when he ""demonstrated"" the lunges his knee was extended way over his toe. OTF is a great workout. They just need to make sure all their instructors are up to par. I'm going to another location this weekend and hoping for a more down to earth instructor who isn't lazy with an attitude.",negative
"LOVE OTF....great workouts and trainers! Kyle is especially amazing always positive and ready to go at 5am! Thanks for training at OTF Kyle, Boom!",positive
"I have worked out for years and there is nothing quite like Orange Theory Fitness. I tried it out as a skeptic and it is now my new addiction. . My fitness level improvements are incredible. If you are bored with your typical workout, you need to give this a try.",positive
"Amazing! That is how I feel after every workout. The trainers are motivating, the workouts vary daily so you don't get bored, and the staff is great. Love that the trainers make sure your workout is at your level, but keep you challenged. Going to OTF is my favorite part of my day!! I love this place!!",positive
"Orange theory is by far the best fitness training I have ever had. I was in decent shape before I joined but I had some goals to meet before I turn 40. I just couldn't seem to get that toning and tightening I was looking for. Then I started Orange and I am in the best shape I have ever been in in my life. The chandler heights / gilbert location has amazing trainers. They keep me motivated and I look forward to my workout with them. It is a challenging workout but if you listen to your trainers you can achieve those goals that you never thought you would. Thank you Tasha, Spencer, and Sonny. I'm gonna rock my 40th birthday!!!",positive
"Absolutely the best workout I've ever had!!! I've been attending now for almost a year and I've seen amazing results. I had already worked with my Trainer Champ in the past and lost a total of 85 lbs but he took me to the next level when he convinced me to join OTF. I lost another 5 lbs and an entire dress size. I'm in the best shape of my life and I owe it all to him and his staff at Orangetheory. If your looking for real results, this is the place!",positive
"Wonderful workout. Always different. Staff is great, helpful, and caters to your specific needs. Not only is the workout all encompassing, but the encouragement during makes me want to come back again. Going to a gym would not have given me that encouragement. None of the workout is intimidating, only encouraging.",positive
Fantastic workout. Never the same workout time after time. The trainers are wonderful and will help you modify if you need it. No excuse not to at least try it.,positive
"I love this gym! You get the feeling (and attention) of personal training in a room of 20 or so people working out. Everyone who works here or works out along side you here is encouraging, motivating, and friendly! Max and Stephanie create a warm, welcoming environment and the staff are so helpful! And the coaches are knowledgeable and attentive.",positive
"I've been a member since June. I have slimmed down, gotten a lot stronger, improved my balance, & learned so much about myself! I'm definitely a lot more competitive than I realized. This is the new 'Cheers' where everyone knows your name! The staff, coaches, and members are all so friendly and welcoming. Everyday is a new workout...you never know what you are going to be doing and I have NEVER repeated the same workout! OTF is definitely family and a really great addiction. They always have fun additional things to do for extra challenges, personal bests, or just plain fun! The price is definitely worth the amount of health & personalized attention you get!!! So worth every penny & all of my love!!! OTF",positive
"Took a free trial class this weekend and signed up for an unlimited membership. I really appreciate the friendly and kind staff, and Stephanie has been my favorite trainer so far. Hours are perfect for my work schedule and I love the weekend hours as well. I would like to update with a few more things that I love about Orange Theory: (1) Class size is limited. Ensures that everyone has enough space. (2) The apps that keep track of your classes and monitor your progress are fab! I love apps. (3) Trainer directed class. It's like having a personal trainer. You just listen and go! (4) Every class is different. (5) Nearly impossible to slack off and not have a great workout.",positive
"Orange Theory, or OTF that we fondly refer to it as is by far the BEST workout you'll ever have. I don't care how disciplined you are at the big gyms or at home, this is totally different. Wearing a heart rate monitor, you track your calorie burning zones and can see when you aren't working hard enough. The coaches motivate you and push you but not in a boot camp way. It's like having your own personal trainer and biggest fan! My body has changed in ways I never imagined in only 6 months and I also gained a new family. It's not easy but you see results and that is the best motivation to get yourself out of bed each day and workout for one hour. Come join us at this location, don't think about it any longer!! Come see what it's all about!",positive
"I absolutely LOVE being a member here and being a part of the OTF family. The staff is so friendly and welcoming and the coaches are amazing. They are very helpful and will also push you to do your best. The workouts are great and are never the same. I do the workouts at my fitness level and never feel intimidated by others who are more advanced. I'm so happy I took that first free class to check it out. After that, I was hooked! My daughter calls Orangetheory Fitness her ""happy place"" and I totally agree!",positive
"This is the best workout I've ever gotten! I've tried many fitness places and gyms, and nothing beats this one! Every class is different and the workouts are never the same. You are constantly pushing your body to change and do something different. The staff is amazing and has become like family. They are always encouraging you to do better. This place has changed my fitness and my life! Love my OTF family #nicolenotjenna",positive
"LOVE LOVE LOVE! THIS IS THE BEST WORKOUT EVER! I've never been able to be in such good shape as I am today and eat so many goodies without feeling any guilt! There's no routine in the workouts (I know because I go 5x a week), the coaches are amazing and you are guaranteed to get results! If you love hard core workouts, this is definitely for you! ???",positive
"Love, love, love this place. Where else can you go and burn a calorie a minute? I've lost 80lbs this year and OTF has been a huge part of my success. The trainers are knowledgeable and attentive. They definitely keep you honest with your form. The reminder that you're supposed to push to where you're a little uncomfortable helps me in those moments when I want to quit. The front desk crew is also so nice and helpful, I feel like I'm visiting with friends prior to my workout. Puts me in a good frame of mind for the tough workout ahead. I think the price is right too. I was working with a personal trainer and paying a fortune. OTF is much more reasonable and I feel like I'm still getting 1:1 training. I definitely recommend!",positive
"I visit from out of town for the holidays often and decided to try out this location and I was not disappointed! They were so nice and very accommodating. They truly made it a positive experience for me, and I have never felt so welcomed at a gym. Max and Marcus were awesome!",positive
"0500 Monday's and Wednesday's!!! I love Steph and Vivian, they both are amazing coaches. There is no wrong question-there is always great support.",positive
"just when you are feeling fit, it pushes you to be the best you can be! Love the motivation Stephanie brings, the strength and encouragement Vivian brings and the staff are awesome!",positive
"I absolutely LOVE this place! I actually look forward to going and I burn at least 600 calories in an hour! The music is fun, the coaches are incredibly helpful and encouraging and I've even met some new friends. I feel like I have a personal coach! All the equipment is clean (we clean after every use) and after just 6 weeks I can see a difference in my body! Totally worth the money!!",positive
"Orange Theory Fitness is basically a Barry's Bootcamp EXCEPT better because you actually wear a heart rate monitor to track your heart rate and calories burned during each class. It's half cardio (treadmill/water rowers) and half weights (free weights, trx, bosu) for 55 mins alternating usually half way through the class. I only have Pros: *the Otf app is super user friendly! You are able to sign up for classes in advance and it totally holds me accountable (they do charge you without an 8 hour notice) you can also book at other gyms from the app *after every class you are emailed your stats from the class which keeps track of your weekly, monthly and yearly calories *because it's a franchise with the unlimited monthly membership I can visit any other gym in the city (not sure about other cities, there might be some sort of fee) *your first class is free, and they loan you a heart rate monitor for the duration of the class *they offer late classes (7pm) and some of the locations do a 90 min class *there is no intimidation-every class is filled with all ages and fitness levels Bottom line....I wish I would've found this place sooner...... like 10 years ago sooner......",positive
"Cancelled my membership because it's too hard to get into the classes that fit my schedule. The morning classes are almost always on a waitlist if you don't reserve a spot 1+ weeks in advance. I was on the 4 classes / month plan, and OTF didn't let me roll over classes when I couldn't fit 4 into the month because their classes were full. So, basically, they were making me pay $60 a month to sit on their class waiting lists. Because their technology doesn't let you book classes past your monthly billing date, I wasn't allowed to book classes further in advance.",negative
The best workout I have ever found! Full body and comprehensive. Awesome coaches with great energy. They correct your form and as they get to know you they push and encourage. Love it here!,positive
"I love starting my day with OT! The variety of the workouts is great- strength training combined with cardio keeps me from getting bored with my daily workout routine. The coaches are great, they ensure you are doing the movements properly and push you to bring your best self to each class!",positive
I like that the coaches get to know you and they push you to work harder than you think you can. It's the motivation and the continued results that I see that keeps me coming back. And the staff is great.,positive
"I only have 3 workouts in so far but it's a good environment. Friendly staff and fellow attendees. Space and equipment are very clean. I was nervous that it would be intense but the way it's set up, you can push yourself at the pace you choose. It's helpful to have the heart rate monitor to gauge how hard you are truly pushing yourself. Lots of different workouts using weights, bosu balls, treadmill, rowers and TRX bands.",positive
"Tough but adaptable work out. If you, like me, try to stay in shape despite many other obligations and worry about muscle loss, but cant get out of the work out rut, this is great exercise class. Basically you rotate between treadmill, rower and resistance weight training. It is a little confusing at first but they direct you. If you dont run you can power walk. The work outs are hard but you feel great after. After3 workouts so far I am sore next day but functional. My level of fitness before is jog 2-3 miles/weights once weekly with skiing/hiking/biking on side. I have to be careful of my wrists and not too bad although there were some things i just didnt do-they will offer you modifications if have injury. In my classes in the burbs there has been wide array of people from middle aged couples, work out freaks and many others. You dont have to worry about fitting in and you can go at your own pace. In order to truly participate u need a monitor ($99! Arm). They have a variety of options/memberships and as I work a lot did the one where I buy a certain number of classes vs membership as I work a lot dont want hassle/frustration of keeping up with membership. At my site they were thankfully not to pushy about membership etc. They offer wide array of times even 5 am classes. Bottom line not cheap, but I Am excited to have this new way to push myself.",positive
"A great way to spend an hour! Trainers are enthusiastic and committed to making us all better. Workouts are different everyday, I always leave feeling like I had an amazing workout. Try it!!",positive
"The class size was just right. Clean, welcoming environment. The trainer (Mandy) was awesome. All of the staff were very supportive and helpful.",positive
OT challenges me to try different exercises. The staff is welcoming and committed to helping me reach my goals. In less then a month I have hit not one but TWO of my goals. OT has allowed me to tap into my inner strength and self love. Everything has improved because I decided to try one class of OT. Thank you for the support!!! Xoxo,positive
"I had a resurfacing facial at Mandara. I regularly get facials and like to always try new spas. I have to say this was the BEST facial I have ever had. The service was impeccable, the esthetician was gentle and informative. The treatment was very thorough and exceptionally relaxing. This is also the first time I eagerly have wanted to buy products after a treatment. I travel to Vegas for work several times a year and will come back to Mandara 100%. Note: the facilities could use an renovation -- however this in no way impacted the quality of my treatment.",positive
"I had an experience recently in Las Vegas that I need to tell you all about. I was recently invited to play a baccarat tournament at Paris Las Vegas, which is owned by Caesars Entertainment Corporation. I made an appointment for an 80-minute massage on December 17 at their spa, the Paris Spa by Mandara. My appointment was for 1 PM and I arrived at 12:45 PM. An attendant gave me a locker, along with a wristband and a key. Inside the locker, I left a gold necklace, a gold Rolex watch, a money clip with $543 dollars, and $500 in playing chips. After my massage, I went to retrieve my belongings, but my gold watch and $500 from my money clip were missing. I immediately notified the staff at the front desk of the spa. We went back to my locker to search, but had no luck. I asked them about the attendant who gave me the locker, key and wristband, but was told he had left for the day. They insisted that I must have left my watch and money somewhere else. I asked them to call Security so they could help me, since the spa was of little help. Security took down my statement. Since I was frustrated that no one seemed to be able to help me, Security advised me to call the Las Vegas Police Department. I called them and they came to take down my report. I was advised to call Risk Management, since they were in charge of such matters. I have left numerous messages, but no one has contacted me yet. I called Security to find out the status of the investigation and they referred me back to Risk Management again. At this point, I feel like I have to hire a lawyer to help me with my case, but would rather not. All I want is a complete investigation and my watch and money back. Since the last thing any Las Vegas casino wants is publicity showing they aren't secure and that they don't protect their guests and their property, the best option I have is to spread the word until they conduct a full investigation. So please Like and Share this Post anywhere and everywhere until they address the matter of my stolen watch and money.",negative
"This is the type of spa set up to relax and spend time enjoying. I just went in for a Brazilian wax and left immediately, so I can't speak to the other aspects of the spa. The staff was nice enough, and my technician was courteous. She made it as painless as possible, but the end result was sub par. She missed a significant amount of hair, including patches in some places. All for more than double the normal price plus a mandatory 20% gratuity. I would not recommend.",negative
"Heed my Warning. This place needs to be shut down by the Health Department. Front Desk was Rude. Groupon did not disclose a 25% additional gratuity fee. During the massage my wife had to pay $15 extra for a ""deep tissue"" because the therapist was literally doing nothing but lightly touching her. Jacuzzi is disgusting. Showers are filthy. Maintenance staff was literally just watching TV. Groupon issued refund.",negative
"Not impressed. I would expect when you pay for a 75 minute massage, you would actually get 75 min. Therapist was 10 minutes late for the appointment to start with. Not sure what she was fumbling with during the massage but it wasn't relaxing in the least bit.",negative
"I went into the spa this morning to access the gym, prior to attending my more in conference. I waited behind a gentleman very attentively to know the protocol as this was my first visit. I approached after he finished and when I told the customer servicer representative my room number, she stated, ""Do you Har your ID?"" I said, ""No."" She replied saying, ""I'm sorry you'll have to have your ID to be certain that your a guest of the hotel."" I simply laughed and went back upstairs to get my ID. I have no issue going back to get my ID; however, if there is a policy in place, it should be universal for all customers. I will cotinue to go, as I am here for a week, but this is unacceptable. Yes, I spoke with hotel management, but I'm uncertain, what, if anything will be done!",negative
"I booked a massage, hot stone and deep tissue and the next day, a fire and ice manicure and pedicure. The massage was out of this world. I had a wonderful massage with a skilled masseuse who got to knots easily and made me feel comfortable. She was on time and got me from the spa in my robe. She led me to a private room and told me everything she was going to do. Her name was Melissa. I think it was one of my best massages ever. It was worth every penny. I used a groupon and added on deep tissue and more time. A very rewarding experience. The next day I got a manicure and pedicure which was NOT worth it. I was amazed I paid $222 for both and the person was almost clueless about what she was doing. She was an older lady who wasted time just walking back and forth while my feet were in the water. I should have complained about it and not paid for it. I get a better manicure and pedicure at my local salon where I live. I heard about the Bellagio offering awesome mani and pedi's and Paris offered the same service, but NOT what I expected! It was so disappointing to a T!!!!!",negative
"WOW. For Las Vegas, for a world famous hotel, for $300+ a person, this is so incredibly horrible, that its baffling that this hasn't been shut down already!!!! Spending a few nights in Vegas on a roadtrip. My husband and i were desperately in need of some relaxation. I finally got the head nod yes, so i booked him an appointment as well. I added on the hot stones for good measure. This of course killed me once the overly chatty and over compensating front desk girl checks us out, and mentions the close to $700 tab PLUS the added gratuity!?!? OMG, reminder of the pure disappointment i had just lived through. BTW they DO NOT mention the added gratuity at check in!! I get to the spa in time to get my "" sauna and cuzz on"". I walk in to an empty, non staffed lounge. I walk around, check it out.. then walk back out to the front. Wait, then this young lady pops out from the office. She checks me in and shows me around. I get my locker. I get undressed. I go to take a rinse off shower. Hair, everywhere. On the walls, on the floors, I feel it starting to grow on me! I then brave it up and head over to the mini, i mean MINI, jacuzzi. The walls in this area are covered in grime, the mural or whatever that is, is from 900 years ago. I go into the steam room. It smells, it smells like filth, musk, just heavy air. They claim its the ""eucalyptus room."" NO. The tiles in the steam room are holding on for dear life, the ground is covered in, you know it- hair. Moving into the sauna. That was the cleanest part, and still nothing i would bring my mother to. After my massage, i went to put my clothes back on. Then i noticed the disgusting carpet floor in the locker room. Covered in stains and, HAIR. I overheard the ""spa check in"" lady talking to another staff member about how she wasn't feeling well. There is NO professionalism. Dirty, disgusting, ripoff. I spend a lot of time going to the YMCA, as well as getting massages at Burke Williams etc. I am no prissy snob, but i know where people feel comfortable getting naked. THIS IS NOT A PLACE FOR THAT. I will never ever ever be back. It is a HUGE RIP OFF. The massage lacked the main thing i told her i needed work on. THIS PLACE IS JUST OUT FOR YOUR MONEY $$$$$$$ They know you are just passing through. They have no work ethic and are incredibly fitly.",negative
"Will not go back! I tried to cancel massage appt that was made for me by a friend. I was 30 mins. past their cancellation time and they would not cancel appoint. I understand that is policy (even if I didn't know it) but the customer service was atrocious! The person on the other line was a rude and had an attitude.. ""Well that is our policy and there's nothing I can do about it."" If you're in customer service you don't have an attitude with your customer. There's also a way to say things to diffuse the situation. She just made me more agitated. she could have been more sympathetic and say I'm sorry wish there was something I could do... So, I try to make the best of the situation and figured I'll go and try to relax. The experience doesnt get better! I get to the front desk to check in. Then she tells me that I'm booked for 75 minutes instead of 50. That's another $80+ for a service I didn't want to begin with. My friend that made the reservation changed the service to 50 mins from 75 immediately after she made the appointment and even had the ladies name who she spoke with. This person was conveniently not there the day we checked in and she made no notes. Again, no let me see what I can do. Or no sincere apology. It was more like, well im sorry but I dont have any notes that you changed your service (said with a stern attitude). She was more accusational like well if you called then there would be a note. As if her people dont make mistakes. So I try to make the most out of the situation again. But the massage was ok. It wasn't bad but it wasn't the best either. I go a couple of times a year and I usually always leave feeling very relaxed. That was not the case this time. The therapist was also unprofessional and just kept talking in the beginning so I couldn't even relax at first. He commented on my tattoo saying that I must be a rebel. He talked about what he wanted to do as a side job. When I talked about being in Vegas with my husband he said ""oh, so you have to be a good girl"". I didn't know how to respond to any of that so I just tried to answer in one word when he'd ask me a question. He eventually stopped talking and I eventually relaxed a little... and then came the hot stones that he placed on my body. One was directly over my bladder. It made me have to go to the bathroom. Talk about killing the relaxing vibe. Needless to say, if you are looking for great front desk customer service and an amazing massage, save a few bucks and go somewhere else. Oh and did I mention the required 20% tip that no one mentioned when you check in? You can't even tip according to how you felt the service went. Yeah, that was another great surprise. I paid $280 for the worst spa experience I've ever had :-(",negative
"Ok spa, ok massage- hubby & I took advantage for the massage special when we checked in. Hubby said his massage was great- he didn't take advantage to the steam-room or showers. I had a good massage with the most talkative masseuse ever. I was looking forward to a big ""unwind"" but instead I got a great massage, but I now know which muscles are causing me issues & what to do to help me keep from knotting up so it was educational...lol all in all for the bargain price they gave me it was worth it. I took advantage of the steam room, the sauna and the whirlpools and the showers. Not the most amazing spa but it was nice for I found the pricing fair & the facility nice.",positive
"This is not a review of the spa services and quality but rather costumer service and unreasonable pricing. My husband and I bought 2 vouchers for a massage from Groupon. When I called to make an appointment, I requested if we could be in the same room for our message. The receptionist said that it would be an additional $197 charge because couple's massages are ""a la carte"". What? It's the same service! On top of that, they will charge a 20% service fee, which will come to another $100. So not worth it. Spend your money on a show instead.",negative
"I have always stayed at the Paris Hotel and have enjoyed the spa on several occasions. This last time was extremely strange to say the least. I had a great massage therapist until she sat down above my head to massage my shoulder and neck. During this time she continued to fall asleep and nod off and on. I even opened my eyes to see what was happening and noticed her nodding off. Maybe there was a legitimate reason why she was so tired but I did not consider it professional at all, especially when you pay their prices. I spoke to the lady at the front desk about it and she stated she would look into it and call me that day. I never received a call or any explanation for them for ignoring my concern. Extremely disappointing!!!",negative
"No clue why there are so many negative reviews since my time here was AMAZING. I went on a groupon and had the body wrap treatment, facial, massage. I felt incredibly pampered. The facility was nice and clean. The aesthetician gave me the best facial (and I've had many facials in NYC).",positive
"While I am only estimating by the fact that I was back dressed and ready to go a good 20 minutes before my friend who also getting a ""50 minute massage"" I figure I got about 35. During which I was talked to about my tattoos constantly, and he even made a comment about the 'natural breasts' on one of my tattoos! I had to tell him about 5 times it was too much pressure. They automatically add 20% tip to the already overpriced service (hello Las Vegas), so if you have a not-so-great experience you can't even tip them accordingly. Which is why I suspect they do that, and why I have had not one but TWO mediocre (at best) massages. They know they are going to get a 20% tip regardless of their service. I stay at the Paris every year, and while I will likely stay there again next year, I will find another spa for massages.",negative
"Stayed at the hotel for 3 nights and needed at least one decent workout. The workout room felt like an afterthought. A dingy underused conference room that had some machines thrown in to create a gym. None of the equipment was well maintained, and there was insufficient equipment for a good workout. I'd rather stay at the venetian complex and get the canyon ranch spa gym there. Now that's a real gym!",negative
"My boyfriend and I celebrated our two year anniversary this weekend and I decided (although last minute) to book a massage for the both of us. I called the spa and left a message to see if they had appointments. Nobody called me back. I called again and finally spoke to someone. I let the guy know that I was holding off on purchasing a couple Groupons until I confirmed they had available appointments. He booked our appointments for 12pm and let me know that check in time was at 11:30am. We arrived at about 11:45am and were told that we needed to have our tickets printed (guy never told me this!).....after haggling with the front desk lady for a few minutes they let me know that I could email the tickets to them...well there is no reception there so I couldn't.....then they told me that because I was 30 minutes late that time would be shaved off our massage...which was ridiculous because check in time is different than my actual appointment time! I thought it was really tacky to say that to someone especially when that was not communicated when I scheduled the appointment. They eventually rushed us in, printed our tickets AND DIDNT shave the time off our massage...The massage was good but your service was pretty unwelcoming and lacked professionalism. Would never recommend this place...",negative
"Went in for a men's haircut. $50.00 + mandatory $10.00 tip. I expected, at least, a highness top notch haircut.....instead it looked like Edward Scissor Hands cut it. One side was cut at least an inch above the ear and the other side actually went over the ear. Horrible job. I asked for another stylist but guess what....the one the hacked it is the only one there for the next two days. So yes, I get to spend my time in Vegas with a complete disaster of a haircut. I am giving this a ""one star"" because the staff was nice and respectful to my complaints and they did reimburse me.",negative
"I have no idea why the reviews on here are so bad. I only went to the gym, not the spa, but I found it to be just fine. A 5 day pass to the gym was $100 (they have single day passes and a 3 day pass too). It was a little pricey but well worth it for a gym located just a few floors down from my room and considering all the buffet eating I did. The gym is pretty big with cardio and weigh training equipment in abundance. Of all the times I was there I only saw a handful of other folks. It's private and quiet. The equipment is clean and in good repair. In fact, I didn't see anything at all broken in the gym. There are several TVs, towels, a water cooler. All the comforts of a regular gym. My 4G coverage was fine in the gym, despite not having any windows or anything, so I could listen to Spotify for music if I wanted. The locker rooms are extremely nice, being part of the spa. The staff is very friendly. All in all, a great experience!",positive
Great spa for a free usage through my diamond card. They have cans of tree top apple juice. The gym is nice and I like the robes,positive
"this review is for the salon only. This place is a dump! They charge as much as the nice places. Go to one of the nice ones. Very dingy, dated salon. poor lighting. Pushy about upselling and products. Mediocre blow-out for $110. Go get a good one at Bellagio, MGM, or Venetian/Palazzo for the same price. MGM will even give you a glass of champagne, and you won't feel like you're in your grandmother's shampoo/set place from the 60s.",negative
"Hi I was just at this facility this past Sunday (11-13-11) and wanted to use the spa for the rate of $25 but then the girl talked me into getting a massage for $ 125 so I decided to go ahead and get it done. When they presented the bill I was busy chatting and didn't realize that they upgraded the time to 75 minutes and now charged me $258 for the services instead of the $ 158 that I thought I was signing for.. The other girl behind the counter even said be careful as they will upgrade you w/o telling you and then charge you for it.. I just didn't think that it would happen as I am standing right there. I called them and after 3 phone calls they would not do anything about the bill. You think for a $100 they would want to save their reputation but I guess times are tough and they will screw you when given the chance .. I am NEVER going there again and would not recommend it to anyone... I wish I had read the reviews prior to going over as I see the reviews are mediocre at best.. PS,. My friend also went to get a massage and she said the masseuse was too rough and when she asked her to ease up pressure, she went so light that it didn't even feel Ike a massage...So she opted out of the massage and got something else done.. NEVER ... NEVER... NEVER AGAIN...",negative
"NOT happy!!! This place is a bit like a modified girls gym. The bathrooms are not clean. They aren't dirty, but i""ve never seen toilet paper on the floor of a bathroom or paper towels that didn't quite make it to the garbage can. There is no one that goes in every 10 minutes to clean these facilities as they do in other spas both on and off the strip. The atmosphere does not feel spa like at all. It feels more like a gym and not even a high end one at that. The lighting is bright in some places, and lowered in others without consideration that guests are moving through all of the spaces. I showed up 5 minutes early. Is that cutting it close? yes for sure. Does that mean that you take me into the massage 10 minutes late and then cut my massage time by 10 minutes because I am ""late""? Not cool Mandara Spa... Not Cool.... The massage itself was acceptable, but again, I kind of felt like these poor masseuses have negative energy from a lack of repeat clients as the strip feels a bit like a churning wheels. I would absolutely not go back unless some amazing sign was given by a massive increase in positive reviews on Yelp.",negative
"You can find a better place. Over priced and they interrupt your ""relaxing"" spa experience trying to sell you stuff. Kind of pathetic.",negative
"I expected to be dissappointed with the mani/pedi because spas rarely give you your money's worth for this service but I needed it so I went to Mandara at Paris. I was more than dissapointed. This was easily the WORST mani/pedi I've ever had - from the exfolitation so vigorous my feet hurt to the ""massage"" better described as a lotion application to the polish that turned white (white?) within a day. I was also the beneficiary of sales pitches for every possible manicure product sold at Mandara. Once again I have learned my lesson, DO NOT go to a spa for manicures or pedicures.",negative
"had a massage here and had such high hopes...but was let down. i was stoked since i had my spa finder gift cards - but it wasn't worth the trouble. the massage itself was just ""okay"". the space and the amenities were so-so. the staff and service is what really brings this down a couple stars. my masseuse was nice enough but i can't stand when they are trying to sell you things. i don't know if they work on commission but basically she was pushing on having me buy some stuff (massage oil?) through the massage. sooooo annoying. and conveniently they had her recommended items ready for me at check out. (ummm, no). i don't plan to visit again. they managed two stars since it was at least clean. oh well.",negative
"Well, I am a little biases because this was my first massage experience, but let me tell you from the best I can. The waiting room and spa facilities were nice. One thing I personally both liked and didnt like is the men women separation. My bf didn't want to go because we couldn't be together so we went to the pool instead to lounge together. I later had a massage and body scrub and then a mani pedi. The massage and scrub was great. It could have lasted forever and the lady was very nice. Oh the waiting room. Not really anything to snack on there, even though they said they do. Whole fruit? more like decoration. and no orange juice. I am a sucker for orange juice. So they offered the choice between their basic mani pedi and the deluxe, and the difference was this little rolling stool and and really nice chair, but I dont think i justifies about $50 difference. The manicurist was nice and keep trying to sell me stuff, but they get commission so I understood so it didnt bother me. She did a good job and I was done. I would go again for massage, but probably somewhere else for mani pedi.",negative
"This spa hit the mother lode of suckitude. I foolishly forgot to get a pedi BEFORE getting on the plane but I could not in good conscience put my nasty claws out on the streets of Vegas. My back was against the wall and I knew that I had to suck it up and spring for an overpriced strip pedicure. OK. Fine. I made my bed. Since I was staying at the Paris, I made a last minute appointment there. Here's where the annoyance comes in. I ask the lady at the spa desk for a pedi. She says in a voice with a note of contempt...""We have a basic...and I mean very basic...pedicure for $65."" Now the voice gets shrill and upbeat ""OR we have our signature spa pedicure, which is a much much more relaxing experience for $120."" Thick painted on smile. I get it. You want to up sell me. So I ask what's the difference. The answer: Spa Chair. That's it? WTF. $55 bucks for a spa chair. No thanks. So I politely decline and get a look like I am the cheapest bastard in the world. Whatever. Just fix my feet, please. I return for my appt and am greeted by a less than friendly clinician. She then does the same up sell speech, showing me the spa chairs. (which are in no way gold plated) Annoying. No thanks. But seriously, Paris, a rolling stool with no back in the middle of the main hallway? That's my $65 option? It was like the pedi of shame. I had to keep myself from rolling around while all of the other people walk by wondering what I was oing in the middle of the hallway. That said, I was determined to enjoy myself despite them and the pedi itself came out fine. When I went to check out, the price came to $80ish. I said, ""I thought it was $65?"" They say, we automatically charge a 15% gratuity. Huh? Where do you get off deciding how much I give for gratuity? It's not like I was a table of 6 or more.I was going to tip 20% but now you can all suck it. And for that, 2 stars!!!",negative
"WAY overpriced!!! Nothing was special about this place. And thats really sad because we spend like 350 for a couples massage for only 60 min... :( the shower/ steam/ jacuzzi area was awful! i mean my gym has better amenties then that!! Oh and the massage therapists didn't actually give you the whole time in my opinion...I think they included dressing time and stuff...lame..but not nearly as lame as the medicore massage that we recieved...ATTENTION: it's called pressure, and when I'm getting a massage I would like to feel some pressure...otherwise I could rub my own body thank you!! next time i'm in town i'm trying ceasers!",negative
"I had a really good massage. Emphasis on the HAD. I should have known when I first got there that the front desk staff was incompetent. They didn't know their policies or processes if their lives depended it. To be fair, if you have a straight forward transaction like you'll use the credit card that you made your reservation under, stuff like that then you probably won't have a problem. They can't handle anything more than that. Also, their price list is wrong. They should follow the price list, I think by law, but they don't. They just say it's old. But then why have it out? And why are the internet prices the same too? They also tack on a mandatory service charge. Anyhow, my friends' experiences were not that great. They had rooms that were cold. One friend went with the four-hands massage. Well her room was friggin' cold and with two people working on you there isn't anywhere for you to be covered. So you're a$$ed out (no pun intended) with having a cold massage. She also complained of too much light int he room but they couldn't do anything about it as it was windows that were letting in the light. So she came out of her treatment crying. Mind you, this is a $300+ treatment. So we went to complain. The girl in the back was helpful, but she ain't the manager. It took the manager over 20 minutes to get back to talk to us. She couldn't even look at us. Kept her eyes shut as she spoke. What's worse, she was the concierge!!! WTF?!?! Shouldn't you be kissing my feet? Anyhow, she promised something and we hung out at the spa a little longer. When we went to check out, our transactions were already processed, where they said that we don't pay till the end b/c I was trying to pay up front and not deal with this mess after I'm all relaxed. Whatever. Whatever the concierge promised didn't get communicated back up front. No one knew what to do. The next shift manager hid from us in the back. It was lame. Oh and uh the spa facilities suck too btw. I guess the day we were there someone made off with the lotion. WTF?!?! Don't you have extra? Wierd. But if you are brave enough to deal with this mess, look up David as your masseuse. He is bomb! He has a warm room and even hooked me up with some hot stones! If I could write a review on just him, I'd give him 5 stars.",negative
"Truth be told...I'm not a big spa fan. I don't like milling around in my robe and slippers with a bunch of other women I don't know. It's no fun. I can't stand steam rooms, hot tubs, etc. etc. BUT...I do like this spa because it was uncrowded, unassuming, simple but clean and had that spa ambiance with the nice showers, lotions, hair dryers, etc. It doesn't have that weird, mega-spa feeling I've had at say, the Westin Mission Sonoma Spa. My girlfriends and I all enjoyed our 80 minute massages, fruit, tea, and other things you usually expect in a chi chi spa experience...just without the attitude. And I highly suggest that if you're going for a massage, that you upgrade that standard 60 to an 80 minute. 60 is never enough, but 80...that's the way to go.",positive
"Staff friendly. Areas clean except men's locker room not so much.... Huge Workout area allows for free immersion, transition, and isolation according to preference. Don't know why people come in groups and then stand or sit in your way??? Planning using as home base for now. Will use massage stations next time!!",positive
"This is the best gym in Westeros. You would think weirdos like giants, night walkers, or even an Imp would bother you during a vigorous workout. Sometime they even leave pizza out for you/peasants from Kings-landing. Jon Snow the manager of this establishment, is one of he kindest people you'll ever meet. They have weights here that even the Mountain/ hounds brother would lift from time to time. Summer is coming so get your workout in cause WINTER IS HERE. PS I'm a Game of Thrones fan.",positive
"Not a bad gym. Cheap price, nice equipment, and open 24/7. Very diverse crowd, but not a whole lot of group classes I guess due to space.",positive
"Excellent location, great equipment, terrific staff. This location has just installed brand new equipment in the building and it has been somewhat upgraded again. However set it there clientele would not miss a beat they offered everyone to use three other facilities for one 24 hour period until they installed And updated new equipment. They let everyone know in advance by sending out numerous emails which Everyone informed. This particular location has always been a definite benefit to the surrounding area. The pricing is affordable And the facilities are terrific.",positive
"I don't normally post reviews, but this deserves one. I have been a Black Card member of Planet Fitness on and off for probably close to 10 years. It isn't the best gym, but it has been convenient. 2 years ago, I resigned a basic membership and was offered a Black Card special for the same price. I took it. Have the Black Card to prove it. I have received all the Black Card privileges for the last 2 years.....until today. An assistant manager in Belmont said that they were not going to honor the agreement. Thankfully, I have memberships at multiple gyms. Needless to say, I cancelled my membership. These people don't seem to care about member retention, and there are much better gyms out there.",negative
"The belmont location is much better. The staff in gastonia, along with some of the members that they talk to, are grossly ill mannered and do not need to be working in the public.",negative
I joined the gym in Gastonia last fall. I was happy with the gym until I encountered a male in the ladies' locker room. I called today to ask about the locker room policy and was told that starting this week any male is free to walk into the ladies' locker room. They call this transgender friendly. I call it anti-female and anti-safety. I am cancelling my membership immediately. I think that the Gastonia franchise should at least have the decency to announce this change so women know not to undress out in the open.,negative
It's so crowded in the afternoons that it's miserable. I'm about to cancel my membership because I can't stand going there. They need more than one Gastonia location. Also wish they had a stand up tanning bed. Giving two stars because the staff are always nice.,negative
"I have been a member for over 1 year. It's a spacious facility filled with every kind of exercise equipment you could want. It's clean, seems to be well run and there is usually never any ""wait"" to use equipment. Oh, and the price is great!",positive
"This is a GREAT fitness facility! I have been a member for years and this is place is NEVER dirty, staff are ALWAY polite and friendly, machines are READILY available, and it is $10 a month! GREAT! I go daily m-f, have for years, and this place is consistently GREAT! Did I say it only costs $10 a month?!?! If you are in the market for a new gym membership--check them OUT!!!",positive
"The street name of this location says it all - there is HOPE for mass market fitness centers. Clean, well maintained, well stocked paper towels and cleaner, and extensive selection of cardio equipment - this is what chain fitness centers should be like. Having purchased a weekly pass for $30.00, I was impressed by the sheer number of cardio equipment at the Gastonia location. Row after row of treadmills, bikes and other cardio equipment prevented any waiting for machines, even that the busiest hours. Since I was a visitor to the area, I had never heard of Planet Fitness but as I started this review, I discovered that they are in California as well. Move over 24 Hour Fitness, a new player is in town and if the California locations are anything like the one in Gastonia, your days are numbered.",positive
I recently switched from LA fitness and all I can say so far are positive things about planet fitness . I have been to this location and the one on 35th Avenue and Peoria . Both are immaculate . I love how they are both so clean . The hydro massage beds are amazing after the workout . I look forward to coming back for more workouts .,positive
Dylan was extremely patient and accommodating of my questions. He took the time to explain the various programs in details and may have convinced me to join the program whereas I was previously in the fence. I would definitely recommend speaking to him.,positive
"I'm actually a fan of Planet Fitness. I like there approach, making it a judgement free zone. The peoria location is pretty big with a ton of equipment in it. They have their icon purple on everything. The men's locker is well maintained. Overall the location is pretty clean. I really like having the lockers and showers. The only thing I can think of to improve is for them to provide sweat and drying towels. That would a full service to me. The employees are pretty good. Always nice and want to say hi. I don't like it when they leave one person there all day. I prefer seeing two working the desk. In this particular strip mall there is a huge parking lot. I mean, HUGE! You will always park pretty close. I haven't had a bad experience with Planet Fitness at either of the locations I've been a member that.",positive
"Don't sign up at this gym!! I have been coming to this gym since June. Out of the blue a young kid named Jesus( general manager) lol told me I'm not allow to cArry a gym bag on the floor and that I need to put it in a locker. Ya no need for that I will just cancel my membership. One has ever came up to me and advised me of this policy. Maybe you should go over your policy's, some people need to carry their medical things. Ya I will go to a normal gym and not be criticized In response to the comment made by your customer service rep. Gym bag was on the side of machine it's impossible for someone to trip cause you can't walk in between machines. Gym isn't responsible for stolen items in lockers so I rather take my gym bag and go someplace else. In a recent post someone had their items stolen and no action was taken. Yet you allowed people on couple occasions to work out in flip flops, bare feet on tread mill etc.",negative
"The staff is friendly (only reason I am giving them one star. You are not allowed to carry a small bag into gym & have to lock it up & if it gets stolen they are not responsible. Had my locker broken into & phones, ID, belongings stolen. Never received a call from the manager. Stay away from this location as staff is unprofessional & they don't care about their customers!!",negative
"They say judgment free zone but they have no such thing. My family were laughed at, pointed at and called fat pigs.They allow those people to still work out and do nothing about it. When you try to stick up for your self they cancel your membership without any notification. Employees are rude they do not let you talk to the manager and lie about their name. After they cancel your membership without any notification they still want to keep your annual fee when you only went there two months of this year. Please do not go to this gym you will be fat shamed for trying to be healthy and they will steal your money. They lost three devoted customers and I hope more after people read this review.",negative
"Never coming here again, seen Cockroaches and when I set my snack down to work out when I got back I came back to a half eaten oatmeal bar and a little mouse running away, this place is disgusting and filthy I wouldnt take a free membership even if they offered. Never going here again. I'm glad they canceled my membership now! I wasnt mad till the mouse ate my snack. Horrible staff and manager. Mise well take a wrecking ball and take the whole building out!",negative
"Positives - New facility/equipment, larger than most other locations, friendly staff for the most part (when they're not too busy gossiping with each other), it's never too busy that you have to wait for equipment (I go late morning). I LOVE the dressing rooms in the showers. Negatives - It's a brand, new facility and when something other than a machine breaks, it doesn't get fixed. A towel hook in one of the showers has been broken/missing since the second week it was open. As of last weekend, both of the tvs in the ladies locker room have not been working. Neither of these is essential to working out, but you'd think in a brand new facility things would be functioning at 100%. I wish someone could take a quick swipe in the showers every few hours and pick up the globs of other people's hair off the shower floor. The other major irritant is the temperature disparity from one area to the next. The massage chair rooms are usually freezing cold....at least 15-20 degrees cooler than the main gym. The tanning area is extremely hot...15-20 degrees warmer than the main gym. Again, this isn't the main purpose of the gym, but if I'm paying $20 just for those amenities, it would be nice if those extra areas were comfortable. I would tan and massage more, but I've learned to check the temps first before going to the trouble of checking in at the front desk for them. Back when they first opened, staff would tell members that they were having a hard time getting the thermostats right, but it's been several months and nothing has changed. All in all, it gets the job done for a very reasonable price. I just wish there was more attention to detail in a brand new gym.",negative
"Great location. I also noticed if a machine is out of service, it actually gets repaired in a timely manner. The equipment is awesome. Wish they had clocks in the stretching/core room, the 360 room and the 30 min circuit. The cup containers on the treadmills, needs to be cleaned more. I noticed the staff usually just wipes only the outside of the machine. I love the PE@PF classes. Surprised not many sign up. Not sure if they are aware. They should start them off with one when a member signs up. Strange how the other reviews got deleted from here. I know there were more before I signed up.",positive
"The gym is great, new equipment is always awesome but it's not the equipment that makes this my gym, its the staff. There's not a day I go in when the manager Elijah is there that he doesn't greet me by name or ask me how far I'm running today. I'm betting I'm not the only person that gets that personalized experience. The rest of the staff is equally as friendly, some of them refer to me by name as well. To be honest I am there almost every day so it's easy to remember me I'm sure, but that's why I feel good enough about myself to go all the time I feel welcome. That comes from the top down, great leadership creates a great environment. Because of Planet Fitness Glendale and more over Peoria I'm not afraid to workout because of what the staff or other members might think of me. And because of that I'm in the best shape of my life down from 236 pounds to 162. If you are looking for a great gym with a friendly and inclusive environment this is the place.",positive
"It's my first time to enroll in a gym. I find it hard to ""drag"" myself to go but since this is a new gym, I felt I should try this. I love all the new equipment and the other facilities. I also like the big tv screens that I can choose from. The massage chairs are also the best! Last week, while I was enjoying the hydromassage, I saw that the timer had gone off but it immediately restarted and seeing that there weren't people inside the room, I continued to enjoy the massage and closed my eyes. I was startled when their gym instructor named Meghan came in, unceremoniously switched it off and said, ""I need you to get off now because there's somebody who's going to use it."" No smile, no ""please"". I felt insulted. It was just rude of her to do that. It was my first rude encounter and I just had to let this off my chest. I'm still giving Planet Fitness 5 stars for the facilities but a failing mark in customer service!",positive
"I love this place so much. The women here are amazing. I almost don't want to post a glowing review because I get really happy if I get there and somehow it's a smaller class size. But this barre studio is a gem. It's like therapy going, it's a great work out that never hurts my old injuries (been in many car accidents), yet I'm lifting and shaping and toning my entire body. The owner is wonderful and takes classes here herself. The staff are kind and happy and know what they are talking about and take the time to help u with movements. I literally have nothing negative to say and I've been going for months now. I'm thankful I found this studio.",positive
"I've been doing Barre at the Chandler location since May 2014 and absolutely LOVE it! If you haven't tried it, you must! It's addicting and you honestly see results! My body has never looked so toned! Cancelled my gym membership because I'm so in love with this workout! The owners Veronica and Marirose are the sweetest and they truly care about their customers, they also listen to feedback. It's a family here! Join us! Tip: Wear yoga pants with skinny legs or capris, bring sticky socks or buy some at the studio.",positive
"Pure Barre Chandler is the cleanest, friendliest and MOST EFFECTIVE gym I've ever been to, the instructors are so sweet, patient and encouraging. The results are far better than any workout I've ever tried, so worth it!",positive
"This workout and studio are amazing! I started while recovering from foot surgery and it definitely helped me heal. I've taken classes from several instructors at the Chandler studio and they all have been welcoming, encouraging, and helpful!",positive
"Great class! The instructors are amazing. This is for any type of person. Stick with it because it never gets easier. The first class will be very intense and confusing but afterwards, you become hooked!",positive
"I found this studio about a year ago and love it. Sadly, I started graduate school and struggle scheduling barre around my school and work schedule. Whenever I get a chance, I take class and remember why it is so awesome. Instructors and front desk staff make it a point to learn everyone's name, and they are very encouraging and hands-on. The only thing that would make this studio better is a 7 am class in the mornings. The owners are also very hands on and instruct classes at this studio a couple of times per week. The studio is costly, but worth it.",positive
"Ladies (gentlemen, too), please do yourself a favor a try a class at Pure Barre! My friend made me go with her to try and I reluctantly went with her and I will admit I hated my first class. Being just a mediocre active person, I was disappointed in myself for not finishing the intense reps of lifting, toning and burning but man did I FEEL amazing after that first class. So I signed up for the new student special and am still in my first month and I am ADDICTED! I will continue for sure. I am not very athletic or flexible but I absolutely love fun group fitness classes to awesome music; I've tried so many. But Pure Barre quickly has become my favorite. To top it off, all the girls are so sweet. They are so helpful and understanding and will always greet you smiling.",positive
The girls here are so encouraging and sweet! You don't feel discouraged like other classes. I hate working out and I finally found a class that keeps me coming back! All of the instructors that I've had take the time to introduce themselves and cheer you on during class. The girls in the front are even awesome!,positive
The first time I came here Maddy was at the front desk. I came here 20 mins before a class starting. She talked to me explaining to me it's a cross between high impact aerobics meets yoga meets Pilates meets ballet. Well with 20 mins to spare I bought an outfit (because I thought this was a juice bar) and I dove in with my two feet! Well....half way in class yes I did want to have a heart attack but I got through. I have a medical condition and all the instructors here will help you and make it work for you! They motivate you and make sure you get through each class. After three classes I saw immediate results. Everyone here is so nice and welcoming. If they don't know you they will ask you your name and will remember it! They have a great selection of workout clothes!!! Trust me lots of money has been spent here! They sell the most delicious smelling candles and adorable bracelets! If you're looking for a new workout look no further! All the girls of PBC will welcome you here,positive
"I was looking for a group fitness place nearby home and from the reviews and the testimonials I decided to sign up. Attended my first class this morning and not only was Trish very accommodating, she kept an eye out and helped me modify the moves so I could do them. Wow was it difficult! I am still feeling it 3 hours later. Very interested in getting better as I was only able to do about half of the moves for a quarter of the time I needed to. So glad I found this place.",positive
"This workout is addicting! Hardest workout I've ever done but super effective. With diet I lost more than 10lbs in 4 weeks. I love the energy from the music and the instructors and the personalized attention in class. I am leaner, stronger, and more confident than ever thanks to Pure Barre. It's a way of life now and I crave going to class. Highly recommend it!",positive
"I'm hooked! I've never been the type of person that wanted to work out but I figured I better start, like it or not. I didn't want the typical gym feel so I decided to try Pure Barre. I've actually been excited about going and look forward to the next class. I've taken class with Sara and Bryanna and they are both amazing. They keep you motivated and help you along the way. No one in class looks at you funny if you can't so something as well as they can do it. It's just a group of girls/women that are trying to better themselves, not to judge others. I'm in love!",positive
"Since I was accustomed to HIIT training, I was really hesitant to try pure barre at first. 9 months later, leaner than ever, and addicted to the burn, I can't get enough of Pure Barre Chandler. The instructors are always welcoming and energetic. The music puts me in the zone hitting the right BPM for all the different segments. And last, but not least the variation of exercises works muscles I've never felt before. I highly recommend taking at least 10 classes to get acclimated with the moves and to really start feeling the difference. LiftToneBurn!",positive
What's not to love?! Best fitness class in the valley by far! I have never seen quicker results then I have with pure barre. And let's not forget about the fabulous ladies who teach the classes! Can they get any hotter?! :) talk about inspiration to hold that tuck just a little bit longer! LTB for life! Xo,positive
"Out of all the places in the Phoenix area who offer Barre classes, this particular Pure Barre location has to be the worst. They have just ONE routine and it never varies. They never ask at the beginning of the class if anyone is new or if anyone has any injuries they need to be aware of. The cutesy 20-somethings who teach these classes make NO adjustments for their older clientele. They expect a 63 year old to be able to do the exact same things that a 23 year old can do. No one ever asked permission to touch me when making a correction either. This is not cool at all. I don't need some snippy instructor touching my pelvis or butt without asking permission first. I would not go back after going 7 times and I would not recommend it to anyone I care about either.",negative
"If you've been considering taking a Pure Barre class, stop considering and just do it! I started taking classes 2 weeks ago today. In the past 14 days, I've gone to 13 classes. Each class has been completely different. You don't have to worry about any sort of annoying repetition. I can't say enough about the instructors. I haven't had a class with everyone yet, but I've taken classes led by Sara, Bryanna and Jasmine. I couldn't pick a favorite instructor if I had to! All three are amazing and different from each other. Regardless, once the 60 minute class is over, I'm dripping sweat! My fiancee thinks it's funny because after each class I call him and say, ""Wow that was the best class ever!"" The website doesn't give you much in terms of what to expect, so if you're curious.. As far as attire, wear yoga pants and a tank. You don't want to wear shorts or capri's that are on the shorter side. You really want your legs to be covered so that your muscles stay warm. Also, there are many exercises that are done on your knees, so wearing pants makes that much easier. Make sure you bring a pair of socks with you. If you want new ones, they sell Pure Barre socks at the studio (which are wonderful!). You'll also want to bring a bottle of water and a small towel for sweat! If you're concerned about being inexperienced or even out of shape, DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT! Your class will be full of women who are experienced, inexperienced, in great shape, in horrible shape, young and old. You can go at your own pace, so don't worry about anyone but yourself. The instructors are awesome about coming around and fixing your form if you're having a hard time or if you can't figure something out. What are you waiting for? Register for a class NOW! :-)",positive
"A great workout for toning, motivational instructors, and a schedule that fits yours! I am obsessed with this place! As much as you feel yourself getting stronger and leaner, the routine never gets easier. I have been attending since the end of March and the instructors always add ways to make the exercises more difficult to challenge your body every time! It is the perfect place for toning! I recently completed the 30-day challenge and was able to see a 4% body fat decrease (without focusing on dieting). My entire body has become leaner. The instructors will keep you coming back! And although I have my favorites, I haven't found one that I don't like. They all have great ways of motivating and challenging you to get the most out of your workout! Pure Barre is open 365 days out of the year and offers several times that can fit your schedule. I know, as my schedule has varied greatly over the past few months and I'm always able to find a time to go. Lastly, your membership applies to Chandler, Scottsdale and Phoenix locations! If you're new, definitely give the New Client Special a try ($100 for the month). I have been fortunate to run into several specials since starting at Pure Barre in March and have yet to pay the full monthly price.",positive
"Where to start??! I love this place. Every instructor I've had is fantastic; they are all encouraging and patient. I feel like my form is corrected 15 times during some classes, but it's always in a positive way. They somehow are VERY good at remembering names.. it's impressive. The fellow classmates are always friendly, it really is just a great environment for self-improvement. Although, I dare anyone to attend a few classes and NOT be tempted to go hit up Lululemon (or anything similar) for new gear. The studio itself is great. It's clean and open and inviting. There is an area for personal stuff in the back, no locker room, but a bathroom if you have to make a quick change after work, before class. Most importantly, the workout! It is tough. After my first class I was sore for a good four days, but of course it's nice to know that your muscles exist. :) Some days I feel like I'm a machine, but Pure Barre always finds a way to bring me back to reality. My legs shake like I'm standing on a fault line and I'm pretty sure some day I will fall over.. I guess that's what the barre is for. Anyway.. I've been coming fairly consistently for almost two months, and I have seen tremendous changes in myself. Every day after Pure Barre feels like a skinny day! My arm muscles and collarbone are starting to poke out.. I've lost inches in my waist and arms; it's great to see actual progress. And since the class is just 55 minutes and is very fast-paced, it's pretty easy to carve out time during the day to come to class. I certainly don't experience the same level of dread as I do with the ""regular"" gym. It is expensive, but since I've been going, there have been deals and promotions to ease up on price. At this point I'd rather pay for Pure Barre than continue to carry a gym membership to a place that I don't really like going. If you're on the fence, give it a shot! It'll win you over.",positive
"I started Pure Barre on March 30th, I am completely addicted! I have never seen faster results or had more fun doing it. The girls are amazing. The fact that I look forward to getting in my car and going, making new friends and meeting new faces while doing it, listening to awesome music, pushing myself harder each time due to the great motivation is all priceless! Trust me, its worth every penny. LTB!",positive
"I am so thrilled that Pure Barre came to Chandler. It is the best hour long full body workout with upbeat music and encouraging instructors. I am 15 days into my 30 day challenge and am a little addicted to how good I feel after each class. I can feel my body changing one inch at a time. Veronica, the owner, is a doll and it is obvious how passionate she is about PB. The instructors are all fantastic and dedicated to helping ensure good form while they TORTURE... ahem.. I mean help you achieve your fitness goals :-) Best workout on the planet. Lift Tone Burn Baby!",positive
"Awesome workouts and fantastic instructors! I never knew that I could get tough workout with barely moving a muscle. I will give a warning: this is a tough workout with great results. I love the staff and they are so friendly. This location is so close to work that I can sneak in a workout during lunch. If you want to get a jump on your swim suit body, check out Pure Barre. In two weeks you will see a serious difference!!! Thanks ladies!",positive
"""...defies gravity by lifting everything up"". My glutes better be mid back and my boobs up to my chin! ...coz It B U R N S!!!",positive
The change room is kept clean but not the equipment. Staff is rude and constantly on their phone. They do not make any effort to make you feel welcome (especially the girl this morning). It seems that management only responds to positive reviews and has no interest in addressing issues of unhappy customers : it already tells you a lot about that place!,negative
"While striving to be one of Toronto's ""finest"" facilities they fall short by quite a wide margin. The facility is extremely overpriced relative to its product offering which I can only assume is justified by the fact that the location is in Leaside. A simple analysis of rates between competitors would show that you would derive far better bang for your buck at gyms such as LA Fitness (Don Mills and York Mills), or GoodLife Fitness (Yonge and Eglinton) who are at a similar price point but also include a wider selection of classes and squash/ basketball courts. Dealing with their management has also been nightmarish. The week that I signed up they convinced me to attend an initial assessment with a ""health professional"" to determine my baseline physical fitness. During the course of 45 mins this ""professional"" relentlessly tried to push personal training on me for 6 months. I had to pull every excuse out of the hat that I could think of from... just finishing grad school, recently getting married and not having the extra cash. Only to have him respond with... ""We'll work something out"", in a very loan sharkish tone! After a few months I left Pure Fitness and have since joined Fit 4 Less. While their facilities are as barebones as they get, there's no harassment from management, the gym is kept exceptionally clean given the few staff employed, and you can't argue with the monthly rates If you live in Leaside and want to stay active and healthy, you have a couple options... 1) Jog outside year round, or 2) Venture a little further outside of Leaside and visit a gym that is finer than Pure Fitness. 1 Star.",negative
"I echo Chris A.'s review. The gym is well maintained, but of course it should be. It is nothing different from a Goodlife location but costs more and is only one location. They are slimey when it comes to billing and cancellation of membership, where you have to 'talk to the manager' and other types of avoidance strategies. It's all very obvious what they're trying to do, so think twice before signing up and make sure to keep your commitment period brief (4-5 months max). Goodlife will probably just buy this location or open one nearby and that will be it.",negative
"First, this isn't a bad gym in terms of clean, well maintained equipment. Change rooms are also maintained and their hours are the usual. It's also rarely packed. Actually, I think the only time it was packed was around New Years, which is understandable. But the staff is horrible. They're pushy but don't budge on negotiating a better price than the ""special"" price you're quoted. Then they don't care about you after you sign up but when it's time to renew your membership suddenly you're interesting to them again. The best thing this gym has going for it is that it's very close by if you live in Leaside. But for a better, cheaper experience it's worth the relatively short drive elsewhere.",negative
"The best gym that I have joined... affordable, great atmosphere and well maintained. Clean, bright and friendly managers/staff. Great selection of classes and great day care providers... just wish they had more day care hours during the afternoon hours. It is busy enough to give you motivation but never cramped. The management team run a fantastic gym and give great service.. so far ;)",positive
"Not impressed. Dirty towels everywhere. No one even at the front when we walked in. But get inside, and I was immediately jumped on by personal trainers that couldn't take the polite hint that I didn't want to buy sessions. Ended up taking a yoga class that was uninspiring but got the job done. Bathrooms were clean and there were plenty of open machines, so that was a small plus. Clientele was a bit creepy. May have just been the day I went, but I will still be looking at other gyms.",negative
"Oh gosh, what a place this is! The only I liked about this place was the little aerobics room- i would use it as a personal dance studio when there weren't classes. The place was very sweaty, hot, and disgusting. Bleh! The staff there is just concerned with money! They try and push supplements on you repeatedly! I tried them for several months and honestly cannot say they made any noticeable difference. I felt judged when going there because people would stare at my confusion towards several machines. Most machines are old and some are not working for weeks at a time. The girls behind the counter seem clueless and are definitely only in it for the paycheck... they act like as though you are inconveniencing them if you ask questions. When I canceled, they gave me the run around for over a month. Finally, after the manager refused to return my calls, I went in and was then charged for two more months as a ""60 day notice"". Oh, AND, my sister-in-law went and was cheated out of over TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS! They convinced her that she had to pay up front for an extreme amount of personal training as part of a discounted price. Well, when my brother got deployed as part of the military one month later, she was never refunded her money! That's ridiculous!",negative
The account was finally fixed. It took four months and several phone calls. It appears that I had to find the right person to complete the task. Other than that it is a basic facility. It gets the job done.,negative
"So since my original review, my previous trainer has left this location, and I have not been given any information why she left. Also, they decided to change the plan I had to a ""group work out"" session instead of a personal training session. I tried this a few times, and it really wasn't for me. When I go for a training session, I want a one-on-one session so the trainer can focus on my progress rather than the group's. But, the final straw that will make me never join Pure Fitness again is I received a letter yesterday from my apartment complex stating that all our memberships with Pure Fitness will be canceled in 3 days. My plan was part of a deal that my apartment complex had with the old owners of the gym. Now, the gym is under new ownership, and instead of letting us have a ""trial period"" to see if the gym has changed for the better, they are just dumping us as customers. I see that the new owners do not care about the previous clientele enough to allow them to see how the new ownership will change the gym for the better. They did offer us an out of pocket membership for an extra charge a month, but we would have to sign up before the old memberships cancel. I would have liked more notice that the ownership was changing hands, and more time to decide if I would like to stay with this gym. I will be taking my business elsewhere as I start my search for a good gym that will meet my needs.",negative
"What a terrible place. My so called ""trainer"" could barely speak full sentences let alone english. He kept pushing pills on me and was very distracted by all of his ""gym rat friends"". He was not attentive. As for the ""membership"" I could not change it to a normal one, which is not what the manage told me when I signed up with him. I have called numerous times to speak with him and he will not get on the phone or return the messages I have left. His receptionist staff have no clue what they are talking about and are very sketchy over the phone, it's ridiculous. The girl could not tell me they were going to try and charge me a fee to cancel ( I have had it) because supposedly everyone's plans are different. Do not go here. So scammy and sketchy. Dirty equipment as well...",negative
"This company does its best to mislead customers about it's memberships. There is no such thing as ""no membership fees"" or ""month to month"" memberships with no contract. Do yourself a favor and don't join. If you do join make sure you read every page of your contract - even the fine print before you sign. Don't be distracted by the sales person they are probably beat over the head with quota so the customer means nothing to them. They just hope you won't read what you're signing. It's hard to believe businesses get away with such shameful practices.",negative
"I have been a member at this location for the last 3 years. From the day I joined the staff has been polite and friendly. Mike Coates, the manager, has been onsite from day one. He runs a tight ship, and is the main reason the facility is the way it is. The staff always welcomes me upon arrival and bids me a 'have a good workout'. Upon departure the staff 'thanks me' and bids me 'fairwell'. It's all a personal touch that goes a long way. The facility is clean, well staffed, and has the equipment and programs that I enjoy. Currently there has been a high energy class called 'Met Con' that takes place Mon-Fri for a half hour at 6PM and 6:30PM. It is intense, and the instructor, Zach, is perfect for the role. He keeps the class moving, encourages pushing yourself, and focuses on good form for the excercises. I will continue enjoying my workouts at Pure Fitness and look forward to Mike and his staff 's hospitality.",positive
"There are so many things wrong with this gym that I could probably write a small book on its gross lack of customer service and inattentiveness to detail, but I'll try to sum it up in under 20 paragraphs. PF puts far more emphasis on the customer it's trying to court than the one it already has. Basically, a sell-sell-sell attitude. Once you are a member, you're nothing to them anymore. -I've tried to get the tv put on to no avail sometimes. PF has numerous tvs and often a big game will be showing where people are doing cardio but where people (moslty men) are lifting free weights, we'll get news or golf. ""I don't know how to work the tv"" or ""I'll ask someone to do it"" are popular responses. I've even been turned down trying to get an ASU game on and that's the local team. Disappointing for a gym with satellite tv. - PF has lowered rates for new customers and done nothing for their existing ones. They've even given equipment away to one of their other gyms meaning you're getting less for your money. - Trainers hold special aerobics classes inside the gym. No, not inside the aerobics room, inside the gym where people work out. It's not unusual to see people doing wind sprints up and down the hallway or a group of people doing ab work in front of a machine you'd like to use. -For years this place didn't provide paper towels. If you wanted to clean down equipment or your brow, you had to buy a towel or bring your own. The bathroom only had heated dryers or toilet paper. It now has paper towel dispensers but some are often empty and workers rarely care. Patrons here do a great job cleaning up after themselves. - Pushing supplements is more important than pushing you to work harder. This location has a very hard time keeping female trainers. Women are constantly being hired, but they don't last long. I'm told being a trainer there is very difficult because you are not just required to recruit a stable of people to train, you have to sell them supplements as well. PF sells its own brand of supps and trainers will tell you how wonderful they are, better prices than stores, etc. I think the trainers are competent, I'm told they're required to sell stuff though and convincing one that Apex is better than name brands and much cheaper is not what we want to hear during our training. - Loose or damaged equipment is often left unattended. From week to week some of the same dumb bells are loose and I once reported a bent bar on the bench press and no one there cared to remove it. I told multiple employees too. - Aerobics classes are subpar and so are the times. Some of the classes are titled one thing and then when you get into the class they're doing something else. I once did a kickboxing class and the girl had us doing wind sprints and some kind of standing aerobic movements that didn't involve punching or kicking. Many of their better classes start at like 5 p.m. It's almost as if their schedule is geared around students. There's a high turnover rate at this gym too. From the front desk girls to the trainers (many of the male trainers have been there a while) to the managers. There's literally a different manager there every few weeks and the guy who introduces himself to you on a Wednesday and says 'If you have any problems my name's Bob,"" will be named Steve a few weeks later and Mark after that. Competitive pricing compared to other gyms, convenience and decent, clean equipment keep me going there. Unless this gym is really convenient for you or the price is well below what other gyms are charging, check into your other options.",negative
"Luckily for me, I've only been approached once by a green trainer who was looking for financial support. I just act surprised that he interrupted my workout, and I plan to say (if I must speak),""When I am interested, I will come to you."" Started in 07/2006 at $12.44/mo because I bought a year's worth, got 6 months free (access to *all* PureFitness'). After that period, I payed monthly (autopay) at $15.24/mo. Suddenly in January, the price went up to $16.05/mo, no reasoning. I called for explanations and was disregarded both times. Actually, not big enough co$t to attempt a conversation with a puppet (like writing a letter to the Pres of US). Weight-room fantastic for my needs. Cardio covers all I need. Machines are well-greased, clean, and free of damage. TV's are low quality, though they have had plasmas JUST WAITING TO TURN ON!! One short-lived semi-manager was bragging to me (1 year ago) that they'd been turned on soon...still not! ha ha ha Aerobics room (wooded flooring) is well equipped and usually empty, unless Yoga, Prankhalatneiokfe (fighting), or cardio classes are happening (morn and night). Locker room is always roomy. Showers are fine. I'm satisfied...thanks!",positive
"I love this studio, i recommend to everybody. Alyssa,she so nice and friendly, studio is clean. Always i met her get energy.",positive
"I love everything about ReBarre. The instructors are all so much fun and so kind, they are all highly trained, so all ages and exercise levels are welcome and accommodated. I always leave the classes feeling better then when i came in. I have also seen a transformation in my strength, stamina and tone. It feels like a family every time you walk in, everyone is welcomed by their name and made to feel part of the studio! It truly is my favorite barre!",positive
"I reached out to Re-Barre asking if they would be interested in donating to a fundraiser I was holding. Alyssa responded immediately, offering to donate and asking if I would also like to try out a class. I ended up going in on a Monday night for class, and loved it! First, the studio is super cute, everything is updated, new and clean. Second, Alyssa was super sweet and nice. Her class was difficult, but not too difficult (modifications!) and I was sore for about 5 days after. I've done Barre at Pure Barre before, but this class was much more difficult and enjoyable. Third, her donation was highly sought after at our fundraiser and the girl who won it can't wait to try out her classes. Thanks for experience, Re-Barre!",positive
"This is my favorite barre studio ever. I can't say enough good things about the instructors, clients and staff. It's a unbelievable workout and everyone is family. It's a joy to go every day!! If you're looking for a challenge and fantastic workout this is the place to go.",positive
"I can't say enough great things about Re-Barre! I have attended barre class consistently for over a year now, and I'm not stopping anytime soon. Each class is different and challenging and I'm never bored. I truly appreciate how the instructors are so fun, open, and helpful. They've even coached me through when I had different work-related injuries/setbacks to help get me reach my full potential. There are also many available times for class (6am to 6pm) which is accommodating for my busy schedule. I never regret going and I leave feeling more energized than when I've arrived. The environment they foster is one of unity and camaraderie, plus they have super cute clothes! Check out Re-Barre...you'll love it!",positive
"I am a Physical Therapist and SUPER picky when it comes to exercise studios. Re-Barre Studio North Scottsdale is THE BEST studio I have been to yet. The location, size, cleanliness, schedule and variety of classes is the best I have seen (Barre, yoga, Buti Yoga, mat pilates, Zumba)! They also offer a breadth of workshops to deepen your personal practice as well: meditation, sound/gong healing, myofascial release!!! I am SOOOOO incredibly impressed and happy with all it has to offer! Each instructor is INCREDIBLE: unique style, GREAT direction, personable, warm and welcoming, and always SUCH a positive, encouraging spirit! I can't say enough about all of them!! Also, they are soooo knowledgeable and highly encourage modifications so if you have any previous or current injuries (I have low back issues), the instructors help provide options in every single class so you can still deeply strengthen while avoiding aggravating any injury. This is HUGE, coming from a P.T. The level of knowledge, care and support the staff gives to the class EACH and EVERY class is far beyond even I could have ever imagined. I think Alyssa, the owner, hand-selected each instructor with PERFECTION! If you have a young child, there is a drop-in childcare place called Daydreams Drop-In Child Care literally next door to here!!! So you can exercise and do something for yourself while your little one has fun next door. This is huge! And the studio has a lot of deals on Groupon that you can get directly from the studio as well. I'm only a month and half into consistently going to Re-Barre and my body is COMPLETELY changing. I am building muscle from the inside out, starting for my core (abs). My shoulders and arms are looking super toned and lean, not bulky whatsoever. I am getting my old surfing body back and soooo stoked! (We moved here from Hawai'i and I started coming here due to reviews on Yelp!) If you are looking to get into shape FAST, have fun and be supported by amazing teachers and fellow classmates, come to Re-Barre Studio North Scottsdale. You will see everything I reviewed is 100% accurate! This place is perfection!!!",positive
"Hands down the best exercise barre studio in Scottsdale! And for that matter best workout in the area that will challenge and change your entire body. You will not regret buying a package or challenging yourself to a month unlimited use of the studio. BEST workout in an hour! Re-Barre will exceed your expectations in every way possible! I have noticed a change in my body quicker than ANY other workouts that I have tried in the past. The workout is intense, yet, the instructors are very well informed allowing beginners to advanced a great workout. ALL of the instructors are AMAZING!!! You will not be disappointed in any class or have to choose certain times when the ""great"" instructors are teaching. They have Re-barre and Buti Yoga (YOU have to try Buti Yoga -- nothing like you have experienced before)! They also offer a zumba class; however, I have not attended a class. I cannot speak higher of the expertise and motivation from the instruction staff. Every class is different, never boring or the same, thus, the preparation from the instructors to create multiple variations during class is impressive. I started at this studio back in January and spoke to a lady that has trained for over four years at the studio (BTW in FANTASTIC shape) and she continues to say that every class is still challenging, hence not boring and RE-Barre WORKS. (ALL classes hit every core part of your body) You will embrace the shake! The studio itself is very welcoming and friendly from the staff to other clients training. I always leave class with a smile and look forward to my next class. Thank you Re-Barre for lifting my booty and spirit! I am ready to go to the barre in the AM!",positive
"I signed up almost 3 yrs ago on a groupon special thinking I would never last, wouldn't fit in, and the exercise wouldn't be my cup of tea or age related. My negative thoughts were quickly left at the door due to the warm welcome by Alyssa and Tamara. The instructors (yes, Tamara and Alyssa actually instruct) do a great job of cueing, validating, supporting, and encouraging. Barre isn't the only fitness exercise offered either. Buti (come be in our tribe!) and Yoga (soliciting more members so we can add more classes!) are phenomenal and mix well with Barre. Seriously people, come join us at RE-BARRE where ""everyone knows your name"" but more importantly we want to share our POSITIVE VIBES!",positive
"I am so impressed by the quality of Re-Barre. They really are ""The Barre Where Everyone Knows Your Name."" The instructors do a great job of keeping the work out moving, offering modifications for all skill levels, and changing up the routines from class to class. As an instructor put it today (paraphrased): the hour is about you, focus on your body, and leave feeling better than when you came in. The instructors are so aware of everyone's positioning and compliment and help adjust as necessary. They're wonderful.",positive
"I lived in the Camden Foothills apartment complex right behind the studio for a year and half and absolutely loved being able to walk 30 seconds to get this incredible barre studio. I had tried barre at another studio in California but didn't think it was for me since the workouts/routines seemed pretty repetitive and some of the ab workouts would hurt my neck and back. This studio, however, is truly the best of barre and I totally came to love this form of exercise because of Re-Barre. The instructors there are genuinely the kindest humans I've ever come across in any exercise setting, and truly make a point to know everyone's name. Customer service that is really hard to come by. Their positivity rubs off on the clients and everyone vibes good energy together. The instructors are also really great at helping you adjust your variations of the moves to fit your body type and abilities. The workouts are excellent/different every single time and they update their playlists often, which is impressive. They sometimes ask for workout requests before class so you can ensure you get to do your favorite moves (ask to do the pretzel - it's painfully wonderful). The resistance bands that they incorporate always left me feeling sore days later too. You don't necessarily sweat like crazy doing barre in general (which is nice if you don't like showering immediately after your workout), so you have to remember to continuously challenge yourself and try heavier weights and harder variations of pushups. They do offer a few zumba classes each week, which are super fun and make you forget it's even a cardio workout. Their Barre 75 classes on Saturday mornings were great because it's 15 minutes of zumba before the full hour of barre.",positive
"Amazing studio and friendly staff! I took my very first Buti Yoga class from Stephanie and it was incredible. She is so talented, energetic and fun! Please go try this studio it won't disappoint. Can't wait to go try the additional classes offered! Oh and don't forget the beautiful yoga gear for sale there!",positive
"The most friendly environment! I always have so much fun there and feel welcome every single time. The Zumba, Buti Yoga and The Yoga classes are unbeatable.",positive
"Wow oh wow the friendly feeling I got the moment I walked into the door of this studio. First of all it's a beautiful space and has some fun clothes and things to buy in the front. The workout space is fairly small but it works. I was at the studio for buti yoga. The instructor was beautiful and great at teaching. Unfortunately, the bar was right in the way of us being able to see ourselves in the mirror to make sure we were doing the poses correctly. We definitely worked up a sweat in his class. It was SO much fun. Studio is slightly pricey. A drop in is $20. I must say it is worth it for the wonderful hospitality.",positive
"I am not one to write an overabundance of positive reviews but when I do write one, it is because the business has earned it! I love fitness and I love trying new things. I enjoy reformer pilates classes and love love love Re-Barre. I feel Re-barre gets those little hard to get muscles that the big movements in pilates can't reach. I have up-ed the amount of classes I take at Re-Barre because I'm seeing positive toning results! And one word if I may about Tamara. She doesn't just phone it in, you know... go through the motions. She is so good at what she does and her positive energy is contagious! When I take her class, I am truly happy to be there. Love this studio!",positive
Favorite barre studio in AZ. I got one month unlimited for $100. you will be deliciously sore if you go here. My favorite instructors are Alyssa and Tamara. this barre studio is my happy place. go. you will not regret it.,positive
"I had my first class at Re-barre today. I've been doing Dailey Method on and off for 2 years. Trying a new studio is always a little uncomfortable when you are very familiar with another style. When I entered, I was great by a very friendly and welcoming staff member. While I was filling out my paperwork, the instructor came out to meet me. I received a tour and she gave me a little background on the studio. I felt totally comfortable by this point. The class and instructor were great. The class moved fluidly from one movement/exercise to the next. I loved the use of bands and balls to help engage even more. After the class I bought the one month unlimited package. They applied the $20 I paid for a single class to the $100- 1 month unlimited so I got it for $80. I'm really looking forward to the next 30 days! The environment is fun and I can already tell that I'm going to be sore tomorrow. This is a great sculpting workout for beginners through advanced fitness levels.",positive
"Okay so this is a seriously fun, seriously kick-butt workout! I discovered barre workouts about a year ago, and immediately became addicted. I have now tried all the studios in the area, and consider myself somewhat of a connoisseur by this point ;) Re-Barre is top-notch, with amazing instructors, super friendly staff, and awesome classes that will give you the results you want, if you stick with it! I have that delicious all-over soreness each time I do a class here :D Gotta love that!!",positive
"I am a ""newbie"", just started barre for the first time, a few classes ago. I was hesitant to try a new form of exercise because I had no idea what to do or what barre entailed. But, at the encouragement of a friend, I gave Rebarre a try. In addition to a great strengthening workout, I have to say that one big reason that I like Rebarre (in addition to the workout) is the warm atmosphere. I LOVE that the instructors know my name--even though they likely see hundreds of people each day. Each time I walk through the door, I am so impressed that Tamara remembers me by name. It makes me feel special, a feeling that you don't usually get from a gym. And, Rebarre is a beautiful studio, but does not seem pretentious at all. Everyone from the instructors to the clients have been very friendly and nice. Even after just few classes I already feel part of the ""family"". :)",positive
"No Alyssa this is not a case of bullying a small business...this is a sad case of mis communication with your employees. I too have several emails along with voice mails that I've given to American Express, my story has never changed and the only error I had was the date in April that I attended class and purchased a package of 10 classes...it was April 24th vs the 9...big deal...You've stated in your post that you have security camera footage ( not sure what relevance this has) but I hope it has audio...I would love to hear the conversation on April 24th with Tamara after class purchasing my package and NEVER ONCE mentioning canceling auto pay...those words never came out of mouth!! On purchasing this package Tamara said my class that day would count as one used..As far as your accusation of ""using your facility for free"" no in fact the camera audio footage would be great here too....you can clearly hear me tell your front desk girl to charge my card on file for the visit on January 9th and again repeated this conversation on February 2nd...and on both visits she opens my account and has me verify my card!! This goes for the same visit on November 24th where I verbally told the front desk girl I wanted to cancel my autopay....she opened my account up in front of me, said I need you to write on a piece of paper confirming your canceling the autopay and date it...I did that and she followed up with telling me it would take 30 days to be effective...I was never told anything different regarding my not being able to cancel etc....so no Alyssa your right I'm not buckling as you've stated because my claims are accurate not false...and yes your company did charge my card again for June not May....Thankfully Amex was on top of it and rejected it June 9th! I'm sad it has come down to me using yelp to communicate as you had not once personally tried to contact me when I first called to resolve this issue...instead you had your account manager calling me.",negative
"I love coming to these workouts! The whole staff makes you feel so welcome and they're adding new things all the time to accommodate their clients lifestyle needs when it comes to their work out. I personally have loved having yoga with both of the Alyssa's, their barre classes have turned me into a convert as well! Love meeting new people through the studio, everyone is very sweet and it's just a great community. Keep it up I love you guys",positive
"The barre where everyone knows your name! Unlike a group fitness class at a big box gym where you can get lost in a crowd, Re-Barre instructors are very attentive to each person. I've been coming to this studio for over two years and I am in the best shape of my life thanks to Alyssa and her team.",positive
I've been coming here since the fall and can't say enough good things about it. I've been to many gyms and done all sorts of classes from Pilates to Bikram yoga and nothing has transformed my body the way re-Barre has. The instructors are all wonderful - of course I have my personal favorites but honestly they are all great - and they mix things up enough to keep it interesting. It is easily the single most supportive fitness environment I've ever been a part of. Well worth the membership cost for that alone.,positive
"This Karve Studio is really welcoming and the energy is great! I'm glad a close friend convinced me to buy this Groupon with him, because I finally got to try a Karve Studio out! My friend and I tried our first class here last Saturday and really enjoyed our time here. He's done the Dailey Method before. I've done The Bar Method and Pure Barre and I really enjoyed this one. The instructors told me that Karve is more similar to Bar Method, and I agree, but this was the perfect mix because although I was pushed and encouraged to have great form and work hard, I didn't feel like a drill sergeant was yelling at me. Michelle was a great motivator and made the class fun! With a previous history of ballet, it is fun to be back in a class where I can use the bar again and whip muscles back into shape that I forgot I had. I'm not one to work on flexibility myself, so it takes classes like these and yoga to help gain more flexibility and motivate me. I was told I wouldn't sweat much, but I did! Even though just the tiniest movements are made, pulsing at the point where your muscles begin to shake can be really tough work and tiring. You know you're getting results though. You feel it. You feel your core getting stronger and you feel your muscles working to the point of exhaustion. Like another reviewer said, it's super addicting, because you love the way you feel at the end and are all smiles when walking out.",positive
"I've been ""Karve-ing"" for 2 years now and I love it! I think it's such a great workout, especially for women, although my husband finds it equally as difficult. I don't like a lot of the high-impact, lose-your-breath workouts so this is perfect for me. I get toned in all the right places...booty lifted, arms sculpted, thighs shaped. Even after 2 years, the workout is never the same and I actually get excited to go work out!",positive
"I've been coming for over a year and I still really love it! You'd think that it would start to get boring after taking a hundred classes or so - but, nope! They keep adding new and interesting elements that keep it fun and challenging. I have noticed a marked difference in my strength and posture. Muscles are definitely tighter and firmer. (And, there is a HUGE sense of accomplishment when you finally successfully do pretzel!) This is a great workout. Try it . . .you'll like it!",positive
"As someone who does not like to work out but trying to get my body together, Karve is perfect for me. I was never motivated with the gym. I took dance classes consistently growing up and loved the results they brought. I had great form and my body was in shape, and plus dancing is fun. Karve brings the focus of ballet from your past with being in perfect form and alignment in your mind throughout the workout. When you do things correctly you get great results. Beyond knowing that being consistent with this will show results rather quickly, all of the women at this studio are so kind and welcoming. Additionally, the instructors are also motivating and fun. Even in pain from the workout you will find yourself laughing at some joke they have made. Additionally, they now have Zumba as well to add cardio to your workout regimen. This is such a fun class and one that for me does not have all of the focus that is necessary during a Karve class. Even though I am sore today from the 9am class I will definitely be back tomorrow to feel the burn, smile, and laugh with the next workout. Love it!",positive
I really appreciate this studio and the lovely people who make it such a positive place. Its a fantastic supplement to my yoga practice. Alyssa the owner couldn't be more kind and supportive.,positive
"I discovered Karve North Scottsdale just over 3 months ago and I was immediately hooked. For many years I have had an on again off again relationship with P90X and the belief that working out at home was enough. Even during my most disciplined times, nothing has been more enjoyable or transformational than Karve. At the time that I took my first class, I had not worked out regularly in almost a year so to say I was out of shape is an understatement. By my 10th class, I was already seeing results! The instructors are fabulous. Each one has their own personality and flair that they impart into class which keeps it entertaining, exciting and incredibly challenging. I do my best to mix up the days and times that I go just so I can experience each of them but each of them also changes up the basic workout regularly so it is never boring! These classes are not for the faint of heart but don't t be intimidated. Check it out for yourself. Your fellow classmates will be friendly and inviting. The instructors are wonderfully clear in their direction and will assist you. Additionally, they encourage modification to meet you level of comfort, knowledge and fitness so you are safe from injury and destined for great results!",positive
"First of all, I'm a grandmother who works at a desk all day! I thought I'd better get off my butt and exercise or I was going to become one of those ""little old ladies"". Not! So I decided to try Karve. It's amazing. The instructors are all so very friendly, and they truly care that your form is correct. They encourage all class members, no matter what their abilities might be. I've been going for 3 months, and I can really see progress being made! I've so grateful that I found this place,. If you're looking for a truly amazing workout, join the ladies at Karve North Scottsdale! I'm so glad I did.",positive
This place is awesome! Got my ass seriously kicked... I was visiting in Scottsdale and decided to try it out and now I am hoping they open one on Los Angeles!!,positive
"I love Rise Nation! The workout is so challenging and I am always drenched in sweat when I'm finished, but the music and dancing lights really help distract you and get you through it! I love that it is only 30 minutes. As a new mom, I can be in and out and still get a tremendous workout. The instructors are all high energy. I highly recommend the versaclimber if you are looking to burn fat with a high intensity and low impact workout. It is pretty pricey, but almost every group fitness place in Cleveland is these days. They do run several specials a year though, so I always wait for those.",positive
"Full body workout in a matter of 30 minutes, what more could you ask for in a group fitness class in the heart of any city? Rise Nation is not just a workout class, but a way of living. Continuously challenging yourself to strive and rise up both mentally and physically. The versa climber is a 0 impact machine, which is excellent for all alike. Each time I leave a class, Level One or Two, I am ready to take on the day, after I shower, of course. Because let me tell you, do not let the 30 minutes full you because you will be climbing more than you realize. No worries if this is your first time, the coaches are extremely helpful and will walk you through the steps on how to use the machine, what your goals are, and other imperative information. Great news for you newbies, your first class is free AND they have a killer ""first timer"" deal on classes. Coming from a group fitness gal, I love this place and highly recommend it to people that are just getting back into working out or my fellow veterans out there that are putting in the 4-7 days a week of fitness.",positive
"Holy s***, I've found the most intense/enjoyable class in Cleveland. I've been to spinning classes, dance classes, piyo, boxing, -you name it; and this morning I experienced Rise Nation. I. Am. In. Love. Now I am by no means SUPER athletic. But I enjoy a good work out class. And this class did NOT disappoint. I took Dans introductory class at 11:15. And I'll be honest, I was TIRED during the warm up!! But as the class went on, I fell in love. Dan led an up-beat/exciting class and by the third song (you go to the beat of the music) I was in the groove and felt like a badass. (Thanks Dan!) I'll definitely be coming back. And bringing friends. This place is incredible.",positive
"This place is awesome! Visiting from out of town and I love it! Not your average fitness class. It's like the healthy version of a night club. Great music, great instructors that keep you motivated and keep you going. I hate running and cardio because it's so hard on my knees. This is perfect whether you're new to fitness or an experienced trainer. Short but intense 30min. Can go on your lunch break or on your way to or from work. I die almost every time I go but I'm always excited to come back for more. Class prices are great for first timers. And very fair even for frequent returners. Towels available during class and clean showers at no extra charge. I wish we had a gym like this in Toronto. Derek has done an amazing job bringing this gym to life. Highly recommend his classes but also this gym in general. Proud of you D!",positive
"PROS -Full body workout. I could feel muscles that I didn't even know I had in the first 5 minutes of the class! If you do it, right you will give your legs, arms, and abs a sweat fest. -30 minute (intense) classes. I love that you get such a great workout in just half an hour. I won't lie, it is intense, but the instructors encourage you to go at your own pace. -Similar to spinning. I love love love spinning and this was just like spinning, only standing up. Everything was to the beat of the music, you can change your resistance, and like the studio I go to, everything was in the dark (kinda...there were really cool electronic lights that were on and off throughout the class) -Location. Located around the corner from my favorite place downtown, Heinen's. So after I burn all those calories, I can pop in there after class and gain them all back :P -Free class! Your first class is free! And there's a sweet deal on a class package for newcomers should you continue your climb. CONS -Pricey workout. It definitely is up there as far as class prices in the Cleveland area go. However, the bigger the package you buy, the better the deal. And hey, you can't put a price on your health! -Needed more guidance. So everyone was very friendly there, but being my first class, I was thinking the intro to the space and the walk-through of the machine would have been more thorough. Maybe I just caught them on an off day. Or maybe some of this is absorbed after more classes. BOTTOM LINE -I'm starting at the bottom, but will work my way to the top in no time!",positive
"I drove 25minutes because of the positive talk I kept hearing about this gym...& it's all true! This was not only the best 30 minute workout, everyone was very nice and helpful, & encouraging. The place has a great vibe. You definitely should try it.",positive
"As someone who is heavier and trying to lose a decent amount of weight, I was surprised how comfortable I felt in the gym! The instructor I had, Jovana, was extremely kind and knew how to help you with form without embarrassing you. The class is dark with colorful lights which puts you into 'another world' making the workout go by quickly and in a fun way. Also, I took things easy, and stopped when I had to without embarrassment because of the dark room and because everyone was so into their own workout and watching the instructor. I love how the movements correspond with the music, so even if you have to stop for a second, you can easily get back into it. And it was so quick! I felt like I got a really good workout while not sacrificing my schedule. I WILL be back. 100%",positive
"Not just the best workout in 30 minutes, the Best Workout Period! Brand new location and getting better every day. The official opening is set for sometime in September I am told but it is fully functional and the staff and class instructors are great. The studio is super clean and there is always a fresh towel provided on each climber at the beginning of the class (you'll need it!). If you want to try it, I would suggest looking at some of the videos online before you head in just to get an idea of the movements. The staff and instructors are right there with you to make sure you are comfortable on the machine (Versa Climber). Throughout the class there are verbal cues as to what movements to do and a countdown in tune with the music to change movements. The classes are set up in levels and have similar sequence of movements throughout the 30 minute workout. After a class or 2 you really get a hang of things and are more comfortable pushing yourself and working on your form through the class. This is a group workout gym and you register online using your phone app or online. There are multi class deals. ******** Ok so outside of all the introductory stuff, this is a great class with fun/motivational music and enthusiastic instructors. The ambiance is great to focus and motivate with an awesome lighted ceiling that is interactive with the music. Once you come a couple of times and try out the different instructors you can get a feel for the type of music and tempo you like. I have not found one instructor that I did not like, even if the music wasn't my personal taste. I have tried cycle and group training classes, and while I enjoy them and find their uses, this class is my favorite. I burn about 15-20 calories per minute in a full body workout without impact on my joints. This is a very addictive class and I find new ways to challenge myself every time.",positive
"BEST WORKOUT EVER. I had a spine surgery years ago so most workouts end up causing me from back problems, but this one didn't strain my joints. I have been back multiple times and will keep referring my friends- it's just so fun!",positive
Amazing workout with an amazing staff. Completely different than anything else I've tried. Try it out - you won't regret it!,positive
"Richmond Hill location's closed for renovations so I've been coming here. What a pleasant surprise! Counted 2 power racks (YAS) and 1 smith machine, all durable and easy to set up. None of those shitty safety pins that break your fingers every time you reach for one. Their treadmills are a little close to the TV's, maybe to discourage passive exercising, but there's plenty of them so nothing to complain about. I also found various leg machines that are actually useful, and brand-new plates and barbells that feel ergonomic. This crowd seems to be more into serious lifting too, as opposed to the baby boomers and teenagers you'll find at other Snap locations. Unabashed video making and squatting contests run galore and are almost intimidating. Weekday afternoons are nice and dead until 3pm rolls around and then everyone shows up, but on the upside there are some IG-worthy looking people. The only downside is they don't have a studio, or much of a spot for training and calisthenics. The punching bag is also located right in the middle of the gym so everyone can watch you live out your MMA streetfighter fantasies. There are also plenty of mirrors from all angles, especially around the power racks, to satisfy your inner Narcissus. It can't get better. Another downside is they only have 2 bathrooms which double as changing rooms, which could prove socially awkward during busy hours. The plaza does look sketch even by Torontonian standards, which makes the pothole-ridden but ample parking lot fun during the day, but a crime movie setting at night. Overall though, given the selection of equipment here, I'm a fan.",positive
"I've been going to snap for quite a while now roughly a year. This gym isn't a bad gym, but isn't a great gym either. Couple good things about this gym is 24/7 tap gym. Decent size place and offers some xtr equipment. Plenty of treadmills and some are quite high end. Good price and tap card works at any snap fitness. Some bad things about this gym is that it's limited in equipment and machinery. Limited in weights/plates and bars. Very few locations available and if some are close to you awesome! I would have to say it's hard to workout here unless you know what times to go where there aren't too many people working out. This can be good for you or bad depending if you workout or not. Pros as you can use whatever you want whenever. Cons being if you are new it can be hard to just up and start working out without some guidance and usually people are nice enough to tell you if it's harmful for you.",negative
"Love this snap fitness! You'd never know how great it is because it's located in such a sketchy plaza and you can't see inside unlike the other snap fitness in richmond hill. It looks run down and beat up from the outside but when you go in, the equipment is all very new and the machines are pretty unique. Again, no showers. That doesn't affect me because I hate showering in public places.. gross. The changerooms are singular and work more as a bathroom as well. No complaints here, it's very similar to anytime fitness on woodbine/16th except larger. There's only 2-3 bars here, and not enough plates. They should stock up on 45lb plates- not everyone is new and can only squat a plate. They're scarce in this area, and clips .. hell no, I'm not attempting any power clean PRs with no clips! I like the machines here, they're maintained very well and they have stuff that a lot of gyms don't have! 1. olympic rings hanging from the ceiling- that is something you don't see a lot. Love this, great for core workouts! 2. waterrower row machine - omg it's so oldschool, it doesn't turn on but it's basically an old school machine with actual water in the engine. LOVE! Cardio for days. 3. Woodway treadmills - these are amazing treadmills, if you have the opportunity to try them, DO IT!! It makes me feel like I'm not even running. Easy peasy kilometres. 4. Spin bikes - LOVE! Favourite form of cardio for sure. High intensity interval training - check! 5. Battle ropes - omg!! AMAZING FOR WORKOUTS! Love this gym, if I lived closer, I'd be at this location all the time. I don't mind venturing out of my way for this gym though. However .. people here need to learn to rereack their weights.",positive
"Its a basic gym, but has everything you need to work out. Has some nice cardio equipment & nice weights. Yes, there is no shower, but thats why its a basic gym with only the essentials, and that works to keep costs down and fees low. There are some TVs too which is nice. They give you a pass card that you swipe to get in, and you can come ANY time you want, 24/7/365. Thats really the best feature here, there are no off limits hours or days, you can come on holidays, stat holidays, whenever you want. The owner is a nice guy that takes time to get to know the clientele. He will treat you fair, and wont rip you off. Hes usually there during the day, so if there is any billing issues (which there are not) he is always available to discuss (unlike some if the big name gyms in the area which will rip u off any chance they get). I like this place allot. I come regularly, and will probably continue to renew my membership when it expires.",positive
"I love that snap fitness is open 24/7. There is an assortment of different equipment and there are neat features such as TRX suspension training. The owner Pre is a really reasonable and down to earth person. He runs a great facility and you can tell that he cares about his business. I haven't used a personal trainer but I have observed their interactions with their clients and they are professional and motivating, especially Anthony. It's a great place to work out.",positive
"As other's have stated, ther'es no shower, which can be a pretty big pain point if you're just slipping in a workout and not near home. They do have a full set of dumb bells, but *very* little free weights outside of that. No squat rack, bench, or anything. There is a bar you can use for cleans or deadlifts, but overall it's fairly limited. But if you're the machine kinda gal or gal you'll be fine(machine's as in you use machines, not that you are a machine. Or maybe you are a machine, or not, but on machines... you know what I mean). One thing they do have here which is neat, are ropes. Not for pull ups, but for waving up and down... so that the rope looks like a snake... or a wave... you know, that arm workout thing you see elite athletes do... ya, I have no idea what it's called... can we just call it ""the rope""? The ropes bump this from a 2 star to 3 star, since I haven't seen ropes at any other gym. They also have two punching bags, which you can use to punch, kick, body check, hug, or kiss, 24/7!",negative
"Well, it's been a year since my last review. I was hoping to relax in a nice pool....no such luck. The Olympic pool is closed for members (unless you have paid for swimming lessons). The recreational pool is loud and full. On one previous occasion, a child dropped a deuce in the recreational pool. I can't bring myself to get it in it. Why can't members use the empty Olympic pool? The fact if the matter is that management sucks. They want your money, but don't care.",negative
"My family and I have been coming here for about 6 months now. The staff is always friendly, the classes are varied and accommodating time wise. The machines are in good shape and seem to always be in working order. A good variety too.",positive
"It's been over a year since my last review and I'm pleased to say that this Y has improved greatly. I especially would like to call out Devon, the operations director. After hearing about what was happening she made time to meet with me and thoroughly apologized for the rude customer service we had received. One thing that frustrated me is that the the problems our family was having was never sent up to her. I actually didn't even know who she was when she wanted to meet with me. I had met with another employee prior to this who conned me into thinking they were essentially the head honcho at this branch. Anyway, it was surprising to see the turn around that happened and how apparently this was all due to miscommunication. An awful case of it, but I am glad it was cleared up and that Devon made it right.",positive
"Worst worst customer service over the phone ever, no patient answering your questions what so ever! Having attitudes! That's not what I think YMCA should BE! It has come down to my heart!!!",negative
"If you plan on having your child having swim lessons at Southwest YMCA, especially the one on one, I would be cautious. My child's swim instructor was extremely unpredictable and unreliable. I would say 4 of the 8 swim lessons the swim instructor called in sick. One time we agreed on a different day to meet for a swim lesson the instructor forgot. It got to the point that I would email the swim instructor the night before to make sure we would still have a swim lesson. I had emailed the instructor the night before she said she would be there so before we left she called 15 minutes prior to cancel the swim lesson. I would say this experience has made us decide not to continue swim lessons at the YMCA. No professionalism, no reliability, pure amateur. It's frustrating because you make plans around these swim lessons and when the swim instructor can't be professional, as in showing up, then it just makes you very weary every time there is a lesson. Will she be there or will she not? Also while your child is trying to have swim lessons, in a particular spot for swim lessons that does not even indicate it, of course you will have loads of people coming into the pool from that section, other kids, scuba divers, people who don't have a clue a swim lesson is taking place, because there are no signs indicated. It's hard for a child to focus with such commotion. If I could give this review a zero I would. The only thing I like about the YMCA is the Zumba and being able to swim in the Olympic pool, when it isn't closed. The place is run by unreliable, unprofessional, amateurs, who don't give a fig about your time and money. The staff up front are professional and courteous.",negative
"Everything I was looking for in a gym. Good gym, not crowded at peak hours (like lifetime and eos), offer military rate. They clearly tell you upon signing up exactly how you'll be charged and how to cancel. And they post a swim schedule so you don't show up and find all the lanes in use. These ratings bashing costumer service seem to come from someone trying to solve contact issues with the desk workers. If you have a real issue they have very knowledge people to talk to, I just had to schedule a meeting with one and wait a day. I guess people get bent out of shape when the front desk can't instantly help them. That being said the pool is one of the nicest around and with the mil rate for pool and gym you can't beat it.",positive
My kids just started summer camp here and so far I am not pleased. The lack of organization and supervision is really scary. This facility will nickel and dime you. They claim to make their services affordable for everyone. Certainly overpriced for what little they have to offer. It is very unfortunate that there aren't many other options in this area for camp/childcare for school aged children that doesn't cost an arm and a leg. Overall very disappointed.,negative
"We have been family members for 10 years. I rarely went and there were many reasons for that. 1) class times are very limited and very crowded. 2) There is NOWHERE to change your kids, especially if you have infants!! You aren't allowed to use the women's locker room, which would be much better. Instead you have to use the ""family"" changing room, which is anything but designed for families. You have to lay them on the floor to change them. When I went with my older girls (5 and 7), there isn't anywhere to put anything! No counters, tables, benches, or chairs to lay out dry clothes or put down wet swim suits and towels. It's just AWFUL!! 3) Class times are very limited and crowded. 4) They close early, so if you wanted to go after you put your kids to bed, too bad! 5) I just cancelled my membership and due to the 30 day cancellation notice and the timing of my cancellation, I am PAYING for 2 MONTHS AFTER I CANCELLED THE MEMBERSHIP!! Totally unacceptable!! I am happy to cancel this membership and have been wanting to for years. There are so many better gym options out there. For an organization based on young people and families, that history is not reflected in this location.",negative
"The pool staff used to be good, I felt safe swimming there because all of the guards were in shape. Now everyone that seems to work there is fat or tiny, no one that could pull out a 200 pound man or woman from the bottom of the pool. The management is a mess. YMCA's are in all a very cheap organization. Overall I'd say put your money somewhere else, this YMCA is not worth your money.",negative
"They have rude staff. My friends and I wanted to get a snack out of the vending machine after a long workout. They told us that we could not be there because we did not have a membership, even though we recently purchased one. The workout center is dirty. I was not happy with my experience.",negative
"If I could give 0 stars, I would! We used the summer day camp program for one week, and it was beyond awful. Children were not properly supervised, activities were not age appropriate, and proper licensing guidelines were not followed. Children were allowed free reign while not being provided engaging activities or materials thereby creating a recipe for disaster. The ""director"" was unprofessional and not qualified for her leadership position. Her counselors were technically in the room with the children, but nor ""present"" in their supervision. I would recommend that NO ONE use this summer camp or after school program.",negative
"The Southwest Valley YMCA in Goodyear absolutely sucks in customer service. I understand that most are young students working part time, but they are in great need of training to greet with a smile, multi-task and deliver common courtesy to members. It's common to feel like you are disturbing the employees when you approach them during check in and if you have questions. It's almost like you owe them something. Once this year's membership expires, we will explore other options unless the staff performance improves. The majority of the staff have terrible attitudes and I do NOT recommend the Southwest ValleyYMCA in Goodyear to anyone.",negative
"I joined this Y hoping for a great spirit of community, but it was lacking for me. Also, if you like group fitness, this place is not for you. There is only one exercise room, and the ac is really noisy, so you will not relax if you are taking yoga. No basketball, indoor swimming, etc, and their kids schedule for kids over five doesn't start until 3pm. What if you homeschool? There were a few good classes, but only a few. The rest are senior classes. All in all, I left last month, and it was a good decision.",negative
I couldn't be more frustrated with this facility. We went here to avoid that big gym feel and this place is equal too or worse. First don't get sucked in by the pool because the kids pool or slide is not open often enough or during times you could use. The lap look is always booked or full so if you want to take the kids swimming this isn't the place. They have a cool rock wall but no one is there to let you use it. The kids area is not appropriately staffed and the check in process is very insecure. Say you decide you don't want to use the gym anymore? Good luck canceling. You jump through loops designed to stop you from canceling and still they misplace your file and harass you for the bill you canceled. At $92 a month you can get alot better. Avoid at all cost because I'm still dealing with their billing mistakes.,negative
"We were offered a promotional deal through my wifes employer a few months back to have my family join the YMCA. The promotion was good and I use to work at this location the first 3 years when it opened as a fitness instructor. SO I was excited about joing the YMCA family and being part of the amostphere again. Sadly It has been nothing but bad experinces since we joined. Long slow waits to get checked in for swim braclets or even scnanned to work out in the gym. The young staff at the front desk area seem to be immature and display lots of horseplay. The admin staff continue to have our name spelled wrong and phone number entered incorreclty in the system. After 3 times of searching for me in the system I did get frustrated why the corrections where not made? Especially after they said sorry and told me the changes had been made each single time I went through this process. The kicker was signing my daughter up for swim lessons for the summer only to find out a week later she would not be able to comitt to them due to changes with travel. With more than a weeks notice before swim class started I cancelled the class. I was told I should recieve the refund in 5-7 buisness days. Lets just say it took over 4 weeks, and if I had not followed up on the matter throughout the month it would have been forgotten. Very dissapointed in the customer service and buisness skills that this YMCA provides to its members. It seems very regular from my personal observations that members seem to be complaining at the front desk. Use to be an A+ organization but now it gets a failing grade. I would not recommend this gym.",negative
"I recently moved here from CO. I was a member at the YMCA of Boulder Valley and was very happy. So, fast forward 5 months and I'm looking for a gym. The Y was an obvious choice to check out. I took a tour at approx 10am on a Monday. The place was fairly busy, but not overcrowded. The staff were all friendly and the facility seemed great. The child watch area was great. The child watch staff were playing with the kids. This is what I expect at the Y. When it was time to talk about price, the outgoing and friendly tour guide got shy. I knew something bad was coming because the extroverted young lady seemed embarrassed. Well, now I know why. $70 a month for a single membership, plus $100 reg fee! Even she wasn't willing to turn that positive. She knew they had a great product, but was embarrassed that the Y charged so much. As a former member, she was going to try to snag me a better deal. However, I haven't heard back yet. YMCA staff, if you read this.. Understand that you have the most expensive gym in the area. Even Lifetime Fitness mall and spa have lower rates. Come on! Golds Gym is a great facility (less amenities, I know) right down the street, I could buy 7 basic memberships there for what you are charging. SEVEN! This rate is 40% more than what I was paying at the YMCA of Boulder Valley and they had an ICE RINK! Which is very expensive to operate. I could afford to come join here. However, at the end of the day, I have a duty to my family to be financially responsible. It would be irresponsible of anyone to pay you more than everyone (I mean everyone) else in town. Sad.",negative
"This is a very nice, family-friendly, gym. We love it that they have a nice kiddie pool with a slide, plus the Olympic pool for more serious swimmers. But best of all, is the child care... I wouldn't be able to go work out without taking my kids with me, so it's a super plus that they have such dedicated team to care for the little ones, while we try to get in better shape, or better our health. The ladies at the child care in the morning shift rock!! Kim and Olga are very dedicated to their job, and the kids feel at ease with them.",positive
Over all 3 stars ! My massage girl was not very good . The spa is very nice & beautiful ! I will go back again in the future! Make sure use your M Life card to book :),negative
"My perception upon arrival was impressive. until i went into the waiting area prior to my massage appmt. I have never witnessed the spa staffs were chatting so loud among themselves non stop at the counter. Hopefully the rest of my experience will justify my time.. After 80min of one of the best massages I had, Terra totally helped to redeem the level of expectation. I am satisfied with my experience here!",positive
"I really liked and enjoyed the red carpet facial at the Aria spa. Felt very refreshing and relaxed, and my skin felt so much better: firmer, moisturized, and radiant.

The staff was very professional and friendly.",positive

"Salt room, hot stone bed, eucalyptus steam room, cedar sauna, indoor hot & cold jacuzzi baths and a coed outdoor pool... i'm in spa paradise! But wait, it goes full throttle with a 50 minute revitalizing massage from Jessie! Plan to spend a bit more if you prefer exceptional service. The massage cost me $180 plus a $40 tip and a few extra bucks for the superb service by the attendants. Oh and I have to mention that most rooms and areas will have citrus water, teas, bottled drinks, fruits and healthy treats. All toiletries were provided as well. No need to bring anything except a swimsuit but only if you plan to use the outdoor pool. This is the place to be after your crazy Vegas nights",positive
"It was my first no last visit to their salon. Sadly it is all because of one manicurist. And I called numerous supervisors left a few messages for the manager to please call me. A week later, still no call. My pedicure was going wonderful, front desk girls were friendly, and helpful. Actually one of the best service I received so far at the Aria. Until,.. a manicurist who was across from where I was getting my pedicure done turns around and gives me the filthiest look. Now needless to say I had no idea why, for the next 20 min she continued to actually turn completely around and away from her client to glare at me. Now there were only two of us getting services, Myself and the mean manicurists client, so it was me she was glaring at. I felt intimidated and nervous and wanted out of there. I can't even remember what my girl was talking about as I was wanting her to hurry so I could leave. I didn't even sit around and wait for my toe nails to dry. I asked the receptionist what the girls name was and for her managers card, paid and got the heck out of there. I have never, and I mean never been scared while getting my nails done. And as long as that woman works there I will never go back. I always do spas when in Vegas and usually go to The Wynn, Canyon Ranch at the Venetian, the mandarin, Encore, but was looking forward to the Aria. Tamika made it a awful experience. And if it were not for her I would have definitely returned. We are going back to the Aria in April and I will be going to the Encore for my spa days along with my two daughter in laws. I really think management needs to call clients back especially when they have been told there was a problem. What a shame.",negative
"The spa attendants were very friendly. One even came in the sauna to hand us iced towels. Jen remembered us and reminded us when our massage was coming up. Brandon performed my massage. It was great and I felt very comfortable. He noticed my robe was too long and he got me a smaller robe. Super professional. My friend and I enjoyed the hot stone room, jacuzzi, and sauna. I think the prices are fair for the services and amenities. We will definitely be back!",positive
I had a invitation from Aria Hotel when they opened many years ago. I stayed at the Aria hotel and spend time in spa when they opened first week..very good experience. Always gym and spa is my favorite and top priority. I like modern contemporary style entrance and spa was amazing. I would definitely recommend it!,positive
"Giving 5 stars because of the end results. Lacey styled my hair (voluminous curls/waves) five hours ahead of going out and it held all night into the next day (somehow without feeling like helmet head too). I have fine hair, so this is basically a miracle. Sky gave me a classic manicure and, as someone who is very active and has nails eternally prone to chipping, I could not be more satisfied three days later. Beautifully shaped and perfectly intact, best manicure I have ever received.",positive
"This place is incredible!!!!!!!! I had a massage from Stacy. She's amazing!!!! The whole staff was very helpful, nice, and informative.",positive
"Loved this place. My husband and I got the couples massage for our 4 year wedding anniversary. The service was great from start to finish. Upon entering the spa you receive a tour of all the extra areas you have access to. I loved the meditation room with the heated stone beds. Amazing!! There's a vanity section with complimentary lotions, soaps, razors, etc. you can pamper yourself before your massage. There is a section with 3 jacuzzis in the all women area. All 3 had different temperatures. There's also a waiting area with magazines, drinks, and light snacks. The spa comes with a robe and slippers as you enjoy the amenities. My experience ended with the most amazing one hour full body massage. You get to pick the type of oils you want during the massage and you're left with a nice piece of chocolate at the end. You also have access to the amenities all day long. They also informed me locals get a discount Monday-Thursday which is 25% OFF. I didn't enjoy the rest of the hotel and casino, so the spa is the only reason why I'd come back.",positive
"I spend all day here. This is my oasis away from all the toxins. I will come back every time I beautiful Las Vegas. Beautiful spa, awesome customer service and very relaxing meditation rooms.",positive
"Aria's spa is refreshing in that it offers more co-ed relaxation options than most Vegas spas. (Am I seriously the only person on the Strip who wants to relax *with* her significant other? I was surprised at how few co-ed spa options there are in Vegas.) My fiance and I were able to relax together in a number of public spa areas including the outdoor plunge pool (the view is a little less spectacular than they make it out to be on their website, but I enjoyed that it was heated in the winter time), the salt room (the ergonomic leather chairs vibrate a little, and they are SO AMAZING!), the warm granite room (loved the temp, but laying on a flat, hard slab of granite isn't too comfy) and in the quiet lounge. We indulged in a couples' massage and really enjoyed the ambiance of the luxurious treatment room. The faux fur blankets were a nice, cozy touch. Plus: the massage tables were the most comfortable ones I've ever had the pleasure of laying on. Only complaint was the scented massage oil: The oils were based on pinot grigio and red wine scents (laaaaame and didn't smell all that great.) I love aromatherapy, so I was a little disappointed that there were only two options, and they both sucked. In general, the spa at Aria was nicer and seemed more well-maintained than comparable spas. I've been to pricier Vegas spas, yet Aria's was absolutely pristine everywhere you looked: new towels, new robes, clean and well-maintained spaces, furniture that looked ""like new."" And nary a hint of mold anywhere---that is a BIG DEAL to me. I felt like everything at Aria's spa was clean. It was also super quiet and relaxing. Nothing but grown ass people in there, which is refreshing since some of the other spas on the Strip can get overrun by gaggles of partying youngsters.",positive
"After an eventful weekend of dancing and partying for three days straight, my boyfriend and I knew a little R&R would do our bodies some good. Since my boyfriend has an MLIfe player's card account, we decided that anytime we want to go to the spa, we would try a new location that is part of the MLife family until we knock them all out (minus Excalibur and Luxor because they are too shabby for our taste). Since we were staying at Vdara and we had previously tried out ESPA already; we decided to try Aria's spa since it was just across the way. I requested a 3pm couple's massage appointment so that we could utilize their spa to the fullest especially the outdoor infinity ""therapy pool"". When we arrived the front desk receptionist warmly welcomed us and after signing paperwork directed us toward the elevators where we would go upstairs for the spa facility. The door to the men's/women's facility was so ""futuristic"" and cool! I was a little confused at first because there was no handle, but then I noticed there was panel where you have to wave your hand. It was almost like a secret passage way. Pretty cool. The interior of the women's spa area was very spacious. The siting area had three television sets and several couches to lounge on. The facility had a nice spread of drink options such as tea, coffee, and, ginger ale, and fruit infused water. They also had things to munch on such as apples, pretzels, and a cracker mix. The women's facility area is by far the biggest one I have seen so far out of the Mlife hotels. They have lots of shower/women's toiletries/ plenty of changing rooms/showers. After changing into the rob and slippers given to me I went to the co-ed waiting are to wait for our massage therapist. Their waiting room is also the biggest co-ed waiting area I have ever seen. While we were waiting there one of our therapist greeted us and walked us in the direction of our couple's room we had requested. The room itself is very spacious, and has scents that are very calm and soothing. When in the room the therapist asked us if we had any specific areas we needed work on and then asked us which oil scent we would like used on us. We both loved our message therapist. They used just the right amount of pressure and were able to get the knots out that we had specifically requested they work on. After the massage the therapist waited outside for us to change and then gave us water and escorted us back to the main area and showed us the different facilities we could use. We first went to the Ganbanyoku Beds which are basically warming beds that you can lie for meditation or just to relax after a massage. It wasn't overly hot, it was a perfect warm temperature and the room itself was dimly lit, so the whole experience just soothes and relaxes you. After that room we went next door to Shio Salt Room. The salt bricks on the walls as well as the salt lamps in the room make you feel very relaxed when breathing and sitting on the lounge chairs. Finally, we proceeded to the outdoor ""therapy pool"" which is only accessible by going through the separate locker facilities and has an infinity pool affect that overlooks Aria's day club and a partial city view. The pool is basically a bed co-ed jacuzzi, but still a very relaxing. I loved the ""therapy pool"" because it was so relaxing and soothing. It was very quiet that day because it was a Monday so there wasn't anything going on at the dayclub (thank goodness) and the spa itself wasn't packed, so we basically had the pool to ourselves. While sitting in the pool, you tend to just hang on the edge of the infinity pool and feel very at ease. It was nice and made us feel like time stood still. But, I will mention that the pool area only has six loungers there and the rest are all wall seats, so if it's a busy day, don't expect to get a lounge chair. Overall, our experience at Aria Spa was ""one for the books"". Previously we didn't think that there would be a better experience than the time we went to Bellagio's spa, but this place surpassed our expectations.",positive
"The Aromatherapy Couples Massage was divine! The Spa itself was gorgeous, luxurious and inspires relaxation. In the massage room, you have a screen to choose the type of relaxing music you'd prefer. The massage therapists spoke to us individually about our massage preferences, and did an amazing job throughout the massage. It's probably the first massage that I've had where I don't feel pain, but just good pressure to get out all the kinks! After our massage, my hubby and I went to the Co-Ed Salt Room, and then to the long jacuzzi pool overlooking the Aria Pool and cabanas. The Woman's Spa room had a Eucalyptus Steam room (so amazing) and red cedar sauna. My hubby told me that the men's room had TVs showing the Warriors game, which I thought was hilarious (he loved it) as the women's spa room didn't (I'm thankful for that). Overall, a serene, beautiful experience that my hubby and I are considering doing once a year!",positive
"Had a lovely day at the spa. The eucalyptus steam room was on point - very steamy and hot. The dry sauna could be hotter, it was just warm. Jacuzzis were nice. The outdoor co-ed pool overlooking Liquid day club was pretty nice, however, banging music from Liquid did not give me that ""relaxing"" feeling I was looking for at the Spa, so I did not spend much time by the pool. My husband and I enjoyed the meditation rooms... especially the Salt room with vibrating chairs and soothing music. The spa provides plush robes, lots of towels at your disposal, hair dryers, shampoos, hair brushes, razors, etc. One note though, it would be nice if there was 'lower your voice' policy around the spa... some women were having super loud conversations, which takes away from relaxation.",positive
Love my make up done by Kylie. She is a doll and so friendly. Had my make up done along with two others for my sisters birthday night out in Vegas. Super happy with my make up and love the experience.,positive
"Had make up done here for a friends wedding. The service was great. The staff was super friendly and fun, everyone I saw in there looked great. These gals rocked it and seemed great at what they do!",positive
"**SPA FACILITIES REVIEW ONLY** Lets begin with how my girlfriend and I ended up here. Long story short, during our second day in Vegas, we went to Qua Bath & Spa at Caesars Palace for a massage & spa day. We had such a good time, we went back to enjoy just the facilities since they were soooo nice. However, when we arrived, we found out that the day pass for the facility had gone up to $100 per person. They were REALLY nice, but not $100/person nice... ) you might as well get a $100-$150 treatment). We learned that Aria's spa pass was only $40 for non hotel guests, so we decided to check out their facilities... So here we are at the Aria and the front desk person charged us the hotel guest price of $30. Awesome! We go our separate ways, and through the gateway to relaxation... PROS: - Plenty of free beverage options (coffee, tea, various juices, water, etc) - Nice robe and locker - Co-ed pool was a nice meet up spot for you and your opposite-sex significant other - The room with the hot slab of stone to lay on (also co-ed) - Steam room and cedar dry sauna - Showers, plenty of hair products, razors, toothbrush, whatever you need to freshen up - Jacuzzis were nice CONS - The only bad thing about the place is... it's not as aesthetically pleasing as other spas like the Drift Spa at the Palms or Qua at Caesars. This is a no frills type of place.... nothing will make you go ""ooooooh"" and ""aaaaahhhhhh"". You get what you pay for (which isn't anything to complain about)... it's just when you're fresh from another spa facility that was FREAKIN AMAZING, it makes places like this seem kinda plain. Dont get me wrong, the Jacuzzis and saunas will melt away any stress you build up from the Vegas Strip. If all you're looking for is a hot tub, steam room, and sauna.. you can't beat $30. If you're going to drop $150-250 on a treatment, you're better off going to another spa that has much more enjoyable amenities and a better facility to enjoy before & after treatments.",negative
"I spent a good 4 hours in this spa with some friends. It was worth every dollar of the $30 we spent per person! As soon as we walked in, there were cozy sofas, complimentary drinks and snacks, and a fire place for some relaxation. As you go in more, there are a ton of lockers to place your belongings. After we changed, we went into the hot rocks room, which is exactly what it sounds like lol. You lay down on a piece of hot rock :) Then, we went into the Himalayan salt room. This was soooo relaxing. I think I took 2 naps in here! And then, we went off to the jacuzzi outside, which overlooks the Aria day club. This was a bit loud, so I recommend just going to the indoor jacuzzi if you want some peace and quiet :) And we finished the day off with some sauna time. Overall very pleased with my experience here and will be coming back soon!",positive
"Superb facilities! You feel like you're in another world when you step into the Aria spa. I didn't have any experience in the Salon so this review is mainly for the spa. I was pondering just getting the $30 day access (since I was an Aria guest), but i splurged for a massage as well--a hot stone massage will run you about $180. For the day access, they'll give you a wristband so you can use the facilities till 8pm if you choose. Things I liked about the spa: -Sleek, minimalistic/modern facilities -Easy check-in -Professional and friendly staff that give you your space when you want it -lockers with codes you can setup yourself -spacious stalls in the restrooms and separate changing rooms/shower areas -complimentary sodas, juices, water, coffee, etc -Hot Stone Bed Room: this was different than i thought it would be. There are about 6 beds total in this room. The ""beds"" are actually just platforms with tiles that heat up when you lie on them. So you're essentially lying down on hard ground and using a bamboo mat as a pillow. Not as relaxing as I anticipated. -Himalayan Salt Room: room with walls made of sea salt--you sit in lounge chairs that resonate and vibrate to the music that's playing. Each lounge chair comes with it's own set of headphone so you can get really lost in the music. This room is purposefully cold, i didn't see a noticeable difference in my mood or health, but it was kind of neat to experience. -Eucalyptus Steam room: This was fabulous....and they pump so much steam into the room so you can't see 5 feet in front of you. And you leave feeling like you got rid of all the toxins in your system. (Unisex only) -Sauna Cedar room: I didn't get to try this one, but have heard good things. -Three different jacuzzis with varying temps outside the steam rooms. (Unisex only) -Plenty of lounge chairs -Separate co-ed area which i didn't try out",positive
"Received a facial and body buff. The front desk was a little disorganized and didn't seem very knowledgeable about the different services. My services were very good, though. The spa itself is huge. I checked in early so that I could use the spa. The salt room and heated stone beds were unique. I liked that I could come back and use the spa till they closed at 8 that night, too. Overall, a very good experience.",positive
"By way of full disclosure, I haven't used the spa & salon services at Aria - just the gym, which I hit daily. It's got a massive cardio set-up - I'd guess 18 treadmills, another 10 or so cross-trainers, plus about 8 recumbent and stationary bikes - so you never have to wait for a machine. There's a full circuit of weight machines and a good-sized free weights area too. The gym is one of the primary reasons I stay at the Aria, helping to compensate for its shortcomings in other areas, which I'll address elsewhere.",positive
"Maybe I'm just not a ""spa"" person. I paid the $60 daily use fee for two people and chose this particular spot, because I read that it has the most co-ed areas. Be forewarned, it is a LONG walk from the casino. The staff is very nice, and a lady gave me a tour of the facilities. We tried the heated outdoor pool first. It was quite relaxing, but I wish there was a place to sit by the stronger jets. There is a view of another pool area, but not much else. When it got dark, the water was very hot. The salt room was interesting. When I fist sat down on one of the chairs, it made a terrible racket! Everyone in the room turned and looked at me. It was very embarrassing. Also, there was a lot of trash on the side tables. It was a Monday, and they weren't very busy. I thought there should have been more clean up. Well, the people who go there should also be more respectful and throw away their trash in proper places, but whatever. I thought the music in the room was too loud. My headphones didn't work. Overall, it wasn't really for me. The hot stone room was next. It was actually really hot. And hard. I get that it's a stone, but it was uncomfortable. The other people in the room were sleeping and even snoring, so I guess no one else had a problem with it. I dunno. It was a relaxing day. Maybe if I had scheduled a massage or something, there would have been more things to do. Otherwise, I'd choose to go to the regular pool. If it's the wintertime, it's probably worth it though. Oh, and if you use the gym, it's doubly worth it.",negative
"The staff here charged my card for the tip (as I requested), but when my girlfriend and I went for the massage, the staff informed me that the tip wasn't charged to my card. So afterwards I gave a tip only to find out later my card was already charged for the tip! So I actually gave the masseuse twogo generous tips due to their error! If you here be careful of the charges!",negative
"this review is just for the spa facilities. i haven't received a treatment here yet, but i did take advantage of their $30/day all access pass to the spa facilities and LOVED it. From the relaxing salt room, sauna, steam room, the stone beds to the outdoor jacuzzi (the size of a swimming pool) everything was super clean and nicely decorated. There's plenty of space for co-ed relaxing, as well as private male/female hot and cold pools to jump in to after a sauna/steam. this really is the perfect post hangover space to pamper yourself before another night of vegas debauchery!",positive
"My girlfriends & I go here every week. We have the time of our lives. The staff is friendly & more than accommodating. Lots of little drinks & snacks. Swimsuits are optional, but you get the plushest robe ever. The common facilities are very clean & comfy. If you are a fancy-pants type that needs someone to smooch your behind you are better off going to Sedona or somewhere you are a big deal. This is the greatest most relaxing spa yet & the hot stone room is tha bomb.",positive
"I really loved the spa at Aria & cannot wait to go again on my next visit to Vegas!! I found this spa during a promo in September during the Vegas Spa Week! I received a $ 120 plus facial for $50 including the use of the spa for the day! I was in heaven! The attendant who did my facial was fabulous & even treated me w/ extra special products for my extra sensitive skin! I really felt she cared and gave me the best service! It was so relaxing just to lounge for the day at the out door cooed rectangular wading pool that overlooked the popular Liquids Party pool & to the left Is a view of the large Aria pool ( not a bad view!) The steam room was also quite nice along w/ the whirl pool spas in an open lounging area! I was surprised during a popular ""Spa Week"" that the place wasn't over crowded... It was so relaxing! Oh! I have to mention the many hot and cold drinks available along w/ a variety of fresh fruit! The lovely white robes in every locker was a nice touch I enjoyed!",positive
"Ahhhhhhh....this was my first trip to Vegas that was not a blow-out girls trip. Instead, I tagged along with my poker-lovin' travelin' man (after assuring him I wouldn't cramp his table style), so I had a decent amount of time on my hands during the day. Cue spa day! I scheduled a 50 minute Ashiatsu massage because I can't seem to find anyone who does them in Atlanta and, if you really like deep tissue massage, there is truly nothing like it. The therapist massages you with his or her FEET! And no, they're not just walking on your back like my parents had me do when I was a kid, they are truly *massaging* you with those footsies, while holding on to bars bolted into the ceiling. I just can't describe it properly - it's freakin' amazing. I generally say ""no preference"" when it comes to gender of the stranger who will be rubbin' away but had a mild moment of regret when my dude came to get me from the lounge - ewww boys' feet are YUCKY! Wow, I got over that real fast. This is going to come across wrong, but that man REALLY knew how to use his feet! The massage was over before I knew it, as they do, but the noon poker tourney had just gotten started, so I took my time and took full advantage of every single amenity that spa had to offer. The women-only wet area is like most - hot jacuzzi, cold plunge pool, and a small ""warm"" jacuzzi as well - as Goldilocks would say, it was juuuuust right. Eucalyptus steam room sweated Saturday night right out of me and the Redwood Sauna gave my skin a glow. Most ladies kept their swimsuits on, but a few free spirits went topless. The coed areas include the waiting lounge, a salt room, hot stone beds, and outdoor soaking pool overlooking the Liquid Lounge. Salt room was totally weird - Trekkie-esque lounge chairs and vibrating new age music. I was disappointed at first because I was expecting it to smell like the seaside, and instead it felt kind of cold and sterile, but stick around for a while - eventually you'll start to feel the effect of the salt cleaning out those sinuses. I'm not completely embarrassed to admit that my favorite part just might have been the sheer abundance of US Weekly and People magazines casually lying about in each room...oh yes, sometimes I just adore being a girl!",positive
"I would have only given 3 stars but I was impressed at the amount of coed areas they offer. We really enjoyed the coed endless spa that overlooks the Liquid pool area. It was really fun to people watch. On the downside, perhaps you may not find that booming club music and girls in skimpy bikinis are too relaxing. My boyfriend and I opted for the spa entrance in lieu of a treatment. It cost $30 per person and allowed us unlimited entry for the entire day. I was very surprised that once you look past the upscale decoration, the only thing the spa really offers is a steam room, sauna, jacuzzi and some relaxation rooms. If you're used to a mediocre spa experience then this one will probably really impress you. I've been to most of the high-end spas in Vegas and this one just doesn't compare. You will be disappointed if you are expecting something like Canyon Ranch Spa. They don't have any special showers with shower heads to reach all your parts like I've experienced elsewhere and the spa products (shampoo, lotion, etc.) are just average. I guess I just expected a little more from this level of resort.",positive
"I was in Pittsburgh for the weekend and came to the Saturday open mat. First and most important the culture at this gym is spot on how you want your school. The gym is filled with humble, friendly killers. The level of Jui Jitsu is high and for an older practitioner most importantly safe. If I make it back to Pittsburgh, I would definitely come here to train. The facility was clean & well maintained. The locker room had a shower, which is not a given at many bjj schools. They have a multitude of classes & open mats spanning all 7 days. The instruction must be very good as even the relatively new students roll very smooth. By the way there was no charge for coming to open mat and I would have gladly paid.",positive
Live in LA but travel to pittsburgh several times a year. Have trained here on my last two trips and can't say enough good things about it. I've done both the fitness classes and the boxing/muy Thai. Classes are great for both beginners and those with experience and staff is super friendly and welcoming. I will definitely be back on my next trip.,positive
Great training. Great guys. Hospitable and friendly. Good for all levels. Some amazing wrestlers to boot. I came into town on business and stopped by to train. They were very open to allowing me in. I will be going back on my next business trip.,positive
"Beautiful academy, large space, great instruction shows in the strong students. Very welcoming to visitors for drop-ins. Real lovers of BJJ and the martial arts broadly. Super friendly reception, helped me to get orientes quickly, made real effort to make me feel welcome and to make sure I had a good experience - which I very much did! Definately will return, and really advocate for this excelent academy. Check it out!",positive
"SUPER late review but I was talking about Jiu jitsu with some training partners and I remembered having visited this place about a year and a half ago. It was a little difficult to find if you're not from the area ( nondescript building on a small side street) but once you're there you will be impressed. The facility is super spacious and very clean. The locker rooms are pretty modern and well kept. There's even a small ""chill"" area with some tables for the non-participating type. The training was legit. VIGOROUS warm-ups and kick-ass training partners. Rest assured, there are no easy rolls here. I've visited BJJ gyms all over the country and this is for sure one of the best ones out there. If I ever found myself in Pittsburg for any extended amount of time, I wouldn't hesitate joining this gym. Also, Warren was a super nice guy!",positive
"Spacious and clean facility, highly knowledgable and attentive instruction, friendly and respectful training partners, a real gem of a school in Pittsburgh.",positive
"I have been traveling for work for over ten years, during that time, I have done drop ins all over the world --- very rarely do I have an experience the same as I had this week at Stout's. From the top, Warren, to his brother, Logan and all their team mates welcomed me onto their mats. His guys are down to earth, just plain old good guys. I do not often run into blue belts that can flow roll, these blues are solid. High level purple belts were a great roll. Their browns are just tough, but fun rolls. Everyone of them only went as hard as I wanted too. Warren spent considerable time with me during class to breakdown and fix a position I was having problems with. I spent 20 minutes talking to Warren at the end of class about his school, traveling, BJJ, life......It was refreshing to see someone so selfless, that dedicates and shares his love for BJJ with his students and the world. If your considering going to Stout's, there is really no reason not to start learning today, you can't go wrong.",positive
"I would say that if the idea of doing Muay Thai sounds like something you would be interested in, you'll very likely enjoy going to Stout Training. When I've tried to talk my friends into joining (I'm sorry I'm that guy), the biggest pushback is typically that although they are interested, they're not sure if they would fit in with their current fitness level. I have seen people come through at all fitness levels and with all body types. There are some people here who run through pushups, and some who need to pace themselves with modified ones. Personally, I remember what it's like to be ready to welcome the cold embrace of death after just the warmup. But the instructors and the people here are super supportive and are really there just to work hard and have a good time. Actually, the instructors are scarily good at knowing when to check up on you and to make sure that you're ok, and when to push you to harder. When I am successful at convincing my friends to try out a fundamentals class, they've always been incredibly positive in their reviews. Also, the instructors here clearly show a deep reverence for the sport. I don't know what this specifically does for me, but I feel like this is a good thing. To address another big pushback I've heard from my friends when I've tried to convince them to join- as a college student, I know it's far from campus. Also, having come from a college that constantly screams at you ""PAIN IS TEMPORARY, GPA IS FOREVER"", I know what it's like to let the membership sit empty because time is sometimes too costly a commodity. Trust me, I've gotten way too many of those ""We've missed you!"" emails they send when you haven't been to the gym in about ~2 weeks. But even so, I don't regret joining. It's worth it. This place is truly a community that is full of people that inspire you to dig deeper, be better, and hit harder. I can't promise that stepping into the gym will immediately feel like Thanksgiving dinner with the family, but people are really friendly here and they're always super excited to see people come back. Even though it's only been a year, I would say that my college experience would have been much poorer had my friend not first convinced me to step through the doors of this gym. And yes, to reiterate what my friend has said below, they were much nicer than the hot yoga instructors we met before joining. P.S. Make fun of Kru (be prepared to die for it though)",positive
"Great environment for any level. Great instruction. Have no fear if you have never done anything before, the staff here is great and progressing you through the curriculum at the appropriate pace and against suitable classmates. That being said, be SURE you are willing to commit for the long term, as the cancellation process can only be considered a clusterfuck at best. They try to shift the blame to the ""billing company"", but if that's the case simply use another one, there are many. Not only do you have to waste your time writing a cancellation letter AND make time to stop in for an ""exit interview"", but then you get hit with a month's cancellation charge on top of that. I didn't realize anyone in fitness related industries even practiced this anymore (as someone who works in the industry). And due to not having time during the hours someone was there to do said interview, I was charged for 2 months worth of classes in the meantime in which I did not attend even one. From what I witnessed during the interview, cancelling the automatic payments consisted of a few keystrokes which could have been done at the time of my initial cancellation request. Hard to not feel the whole thing from a business standpoint is just a little shady. And I hate to write this because I really like the instructors and the quality environment, but the business end of things could use some work. All it does is fester resentment from the POV of the consumer through wasting both their time and money - the two most valuable currencies we have.",negative
"The training is great and everything is great but beware of the contract and cancellation fee. I registered for a month with 85 dollar but the cancelation fee was 115 dollar which is silly. It was bad ending. However, after long exchange of emails, Andy waived the cancelation fee because I was not in town during the end of the contract. I did not have to pay. I mean they still have good business negotiation and morality but their policy is bad. Extra cancelation fee and you have to come for a 5 minute meeting before you cancel ! I thought this is a gym not a job !",negative
"Warren, Andy, Mike, and Cody are some of the most caring coaches I have met in Martial Arts. To them, the key to having a successful business is being a family. This shows as their focus on their students growth is paramount. Follow their plan, make classes, and you WILL be successful in reaching your goal. Having spent 25 years in wrestling you often meet great people, the same doesnt always seem to hold true for other martial arts. But at Stout Training Pittsburgh, goodness is at their core. I was lucky enough to travel into town from New York City and North Jersey and to learn from them for 3 days. They helped me more than I could have ever dreamed, I am looking forward to paying back the favor. Jeff Marsh, Edge School of Wrestling, Hoboken, New Jersey www.edgehoboken.com",positive
Son's been training with coach Mike and coach Mark. Awesome guys who genuinely care about their students. The fight team's devotion to their gym's youth is unsurpassed. The fact that the coaches compete is huge as it sets the ultimate example for the youth in how one competes honorably. It also sets the tone and work ethic in every workout.,positive
"Two weeks in doing Muay Thai fundamentals at Stout: I'm really enjoying my training so far. I've always wanted to be comfortable with a martial art and Muay Thai at Stout really appeals to me: class feels like I'm among colleagues of varying abilities, all of whom are willing to help me (a total novice) out with an air of mutual respect. I don't like the stratified authority--bowing to masters, etc.--that a lot of martial arts have. So the informal but rigorously structured makeup of Muay Thai classes at Stout has been just what I'm looking for. Most of my life I've been a physically fit person. I used to think ""eh, I'm tall and in good shape, I could handle myself in a fight"". Two weeks here has, to my happy surprise, proved me wrong. My coordination, reflexes, and technique are all pretty bad (but are improving with every class). I'd like to keep improving these; I'd like to feel competent at self-defense. Mostly I just enjoy learning things and getting a workout while I do. It feels good to get exhausted in the process of internalizing technique. I signed up at Stout in particular because I was hoping for classes that make me feel comfortable and like I'm learning every time I come. So far that's how it has been.",positive
"Thanks to Stout Training, I find myself an unlikely convert to Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu. I am a mother of 2 boys in my late 30's. I work full-time and have an extremely busy schedule. I am amazed to say that I have found a place I love to go and that I feel more fit, both mentally and physically, than I have in years. My initial goal was to find classes for my son. The instructors have been amazing with my high energy kids They are creative and enthusiastic and they have also clearly invested in learning teaching techniques appropriate for children at various levels of development. Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu is an excellent choice for young children. The belt system is set up to provide regular encouragement and the instructors carefully explain to the class that stripes and belts are earned by hard work. Stout Training has a robust selection of classes for kids who are 5 and over and two classes a week for children as young as 3. I plan to get my second son involved soon and expect that both boys will be long-term members of this community. I felt so welcome that I decided I should get off the sidelines. I am not an athletic person. And I started this year at least 25 pounds overweight. I have known for a long time that I probably needed to engage in resistance training but honestly, I was completely intimidated by the idea of going to a gym. I imagined myself feeling very alone in a room of barbells with no idea what to do. I also imagined that it would be pretty clear to anyone else in the gym - that I didn't belong. After a month or so of bringing my son to class twice a week at Stout Training, I had a bit of an epiphany. I was honestly shocked at the warmth of the community at Stout. Of course there are a lot of very serious athletes here, both male and female, but there are also a fair amount of regular folks just trying to get healthier and a lot of parents and small children who all feel at home. It takes a pretty special place to foster such a welcoming tone with such a diverse range of people. Kettlebells. Honestly, the only reason I made it through the first month or so of weekly kettlebell class was because there is a beginners class at the same time as the youth Jiu-Jitsu program on Tuesday nights, and if I was going to leave work early, I was determined to multi-task during that time. Then there was a day, maybe 2 months in, when the instructor, Will, announced that warm-ups would include 15 push-ups. I laughed a bit to myself, thinking that I hadn't done even ONE push-up from my knees in likely 15 years. But when I attempted my first regular push-up, I realized that kettlebells was working for me. I was able to do all 15 push-up - from my feet! Kettlebells is a perfect way to build strength, because it really lets you start wherever you are. Will is a fantastic instructor. He explains the techniques with clarity and patience and makes me feel like I will learn to do things I would have once said were completely impossible. Jiu-Jitsu. Again, the first month of class was pretty rough. I didn't think I was going to make it through the very first warm-up. But the structure of the classes is great. You focus on drilling a technique with a training partner for most of the class and then you end with sparring sessions. I generally have either Dean or Warren as my instructor and, as with the youth program, it is evident that they are not only talented Jiu-Jitsu practitioners, but excellent teachers. I am starting to see huge improvements in my fitness. The callisthenic warm-ups have gone from torturous to breezy. And I LOVE how I feel headed back to my office job after an hour of rolling. Oddly, it isn't just the physical workout I enjoy. Jiu-Jitsu challenges you to take a deep breath when you are in a tight spot and think strategically about how to create some room to maneuver. This is a matter of mindfulness that easily transfers into my professional life. The Results. I give Stout Training my highest accolades. Before I found this community, I had a strong desire to find a way to be healthy, but very little hope. And now I have an exercise routine that I can honestly say I relish. I love to go to class. I love sharing this activity with my son. But the kicker is, at only 3 classes a week, I have dropped 10 pounds since the first of year, and I just bought new suits that are 2 sizes smaller than I was wearing at Christmas. But beyond the weight loss, I have gained a new perspective about myself and what my body might be able to do. I am excited to imagine a life full of fun, physical activities with my boys.",positive
"Stout Training has always welcomed us warmly to drop in and train there. The gym is very well located in the Strip District and the setting is very neat - there's a slight loft-feel to it, which I like. The facilities are clean, from the matts to the locker rooms (men and women). The credentials of the instructors speak for themselves, so I'll just say that the staff was very chill and very gracious. I'd definitely recommend this gym to anybody who wants to train BJJ in Pittsburgh.",positive
"This review is for a yelp get fit event. Don't let the hidden location fool you. This place is located right next door to the Thin Man Sandwich shop on the second floor of the building.. Huge space! They have cubbies to keep your stuff, really nice bathrooms with showers and a new cage training room. I went for a Kettle Bell class. I honestly thought you just swung different level weights. Boy could I have been more wrong. The trainers were more than patient with us and gave helpful friendly advice and the perfect amount of motivation and encouragement. We did moves on the floor, planks and some swings of the bells. It really is a great workout. I thought I would be intimidated at a training gym but the instructors are so friendly and welcoming. This is a great thing to do if you really want to get toned and gain strength.",positive
"A review for YELP GETS FIT * January 11, 2015 I can barely move. The tops of my forearms hurt. Is that even a thing? I've done a lot of workouts before and I swear the only time my forearms have hurt were the times when I was accidently scraped with a rapier during stage combat class. Oh wait. My forearms DID hurt during those classes. I think I blocked it out. ANYWAY. There's the kind of pain that makes you cry and there's the pain that makes you smile. And this, my friendly Yelpers, is the latter. For the second time in as many months, I attended a workshop at this fine establishment. This time organized by Yelp's own Kerri M. I felt secure in knowing that I wasn't the only novice in the room. That being said, Renzo has one of the warmest (not literally - it was pretty chilly) environments of any fitness joint in the city. Yesterday's workshop was taught by Jarrett. Jarrett is one solid dude. Friendly and encouraging yet not patronizing - he really needs to visit the LA Fitnesses of the world and show'em how it's done. When he first explained the layout of the workshop I was a bit skeptical. We were to go through a brief warm-up, some mechanics of the kettle bells, then onto a 12 minute workout. ""12 minutes?"" I thought to myself; ""What can I accomplish in 12 minutes?"" Yeah - 12 minutes was totally enough. I broke a real sweat for the first time in a LONG time and loved every second of it. There's something soothing about swinging a kettle bell. I can't explain, I just ask that you consider trying it someday. At the completion of our workout we were treated to some healthy fare courtesy of Jarrett's wife, Deena. She whipped up a selection of spinach smoothies, zoodles (zucchini noodles), kale salad and berried topped with fresh coconut cream. Every bite was delicious and I can't wait to try the recipes. During our post-workout nosh, Jarrett explained a bit more about the class offerings and I was hooked to the point of signing up for a 2-month Transformation Challenge before I left. My first class was at 6am today. While I can barely keep my eyes open right now and bending over at all is a supreme challenge, I couldn't be happier with my choice. Stout Training Pittsburgh hosts workshops on a fairly regular basis. I highly recommended trying it out some day. What have you got to lose...except maybe a few inches? Thanks Kerri M. for organizing such an awesome event!",positive
"Last year I became tired with not really doing very much in terms of physical activity after finishing a few years of rugby and almost ten years of wrestling I looked into starting brazilian jiu jitsu and mma. I quickly found out about Warren Stout and Mike Wilkins, two of the top instructors at Stout Training Pittsburgh. Everyone I talked to told me that if I was looking for good instruction with a fun environment then I should talk to them. Last fall I started training at the old location in Lawrenceville full time under Warren and was very excited when I found out that we would be moving to the Strip District of Pittsburgh, PA which was a much closer location for me. I also found out how affordable training here is, if cost has driven you away from BJJ or any other martial art, Stout Training Pittsburgh is definitely the place for you. In addition the new location, which has been opened for a few months now, is a lot bigger, and has space for Muay Thai, MMA, Conditioning as well as many more BJJ classes. If you are only a beginner or have never tried BJJ before, you have to give it a shot! It is the best decision I have ever made! Come check out the new location, you will love it! Best facilities, best instructors and best environment! Come join us on the mats!",positive
"I highly recommend Stout Training Pittsburgh / Team Renzo Gracie Every time I hit the mats it feels like I'm at home. I am one of the first members to train when Warren first opened up his Academy in Pittsburgh. It has been, and continues to be a tremendous experience. Warren is a top notch instructor that is very compassionate with a seemingly intuitive approach, if there is ever any question or hesitation about a technique he will take the time and review it with you. I travel extensively and I have trained BJJ all over the US and abroad and I can tell you that this is a top notch Academy. We are so lucky to have you in Pittsburgh! Rob Michienzi",positive
"Lemme start off by saying that a man of my corpulence and physicality has never had an issue with laying ass-whoopings whenever i PLEASE! In fact, when I worked as a bouncer at a Cici's pizza (to pay my way through college, obviously) I had the nightly pleasure of tossing wise-cracking fools outta the joint. Them kids stealing breadsticks, SMH! But when I rolled up to this dojo, let me tell you baby--I was IMPRESSED. These cats know how to scrap. And the head samurai Warren Stout is legit. I'll be he's secretly a brother--probably has vitiligo or something. My fat body got tossed around by all these wrestlers and jiu-jitsu guys, so I got MAD RESPECT for this joint. Peace y'all--I'm OUT!",positive
"Was visiting Pittsburgh for a week and had the pleasure of training here. Warren, Andy and all of the students were welcoming and helpful. Great BJJ School.",positive
"There are too many good things to fit in one review. This academy is TOP-NOTCH! I've always loved Brazilian jiu-jitsu and MMA. I was actually looking for a Judo place that was in the city when I happened upon the BJJ gym though. When you first attend, you get a free, one-on-one lesson from one of the many instructors there. I had some BJJ experience from the Army so we were able to skip some of the intro stuff and focus more on positional dominance and transitions. I signed up and everything has been great. There are jiu-jitsu competitors there as well as amateur and Professional Mixed Marital Artists. No one there has an attitude, no one is trying to hurt you. This is one of the most respectful places I've ever been, besides training in the Army. I did karate/american kickboxing when I was younger and the folks who attend this gym are so much more friendly and helpful. Warren Stout, owner, head instructor is super experienced in wrestling, BJJ and MMA. He's very approachable as is everyone who works there. You will be guided on how to gain the skills to learn BJJ, compete in BJJ or simply just protect yourself. There's also Muay Thai there. Kru David Reese is an experienced Muay Thai instructor. He lived in Thailand for about 8 years and has had over 60 professional Muay Thai fights. He's won every major championship that you can win in Thailand and now shares his passion for Muay Thai here at the Renzo Gracie Pittsburgh Jiu-Jitsu and MMA Academy. I haven't done striking in 13 years and he's taken my decent karate roundhouse kick and turned it into a deadly 'Thai Kick'. He trains everyone like there going to fight. This is NOT a cardio kickboxing class. This is real Muay Thai taught by a real Muay Thai fighter/instructor. Jarret teaches MMA conditioning classes. Theses are kettlebell circuits that are a great workout for anyone. Women, don't be afraid. There are plenty of women in this class and I've personally had plenty of female friends show interest in this class. There's an MMA techniques course taught by Mike Wilkins, pro fighter. He's a great instructor that takes the time to show everyone how to incorporate wrestling with BJJ into MMA. These are basic MMA techniques that he is teaching as there are separate classes for the actual fight team. Fight team is by invitation only. I wouldn't trade this experience for anything and I've learned so much more about my personality from this experience. If you ever get the chance to train here, please do. Whether you're an aspiring competitor or just want a good workout, you will not regret it! Parents, there are kids classes too!",positive
"The best in Pittsburgh PA and probably the best in western PA for all thing grappling and MMA. Warren is a great teacher for all skill levels, whether you are a first time white belt of a world class brown belt, he will help you get better. Check the website for classes that fit your needs and get on the mat!",positive
"An awesome jiu jiitsu club in Pittsburgh. Warren is a great instructor - he takes time to make sure you get the details. He's trained a lot with some amazing jiu jitsu players - Rolles, Renzo and Daniel Gracie. It's clear that jiu jitsu is a big part of life and probably will be until he can't do it anymore. We have a bunch of talented wrestlers, and a bunch of skilled jiu jitsu players (and a lot of overlap). We train gi and no-gi. I think this provides the club with a great mix of styles - the technical Brazilian jiu jitsu skills and the phenomenal take downs and intensity of the wrestlers. It's a great atmosphere and an awesome place to train, if you're looking to improve your technique while increasing your fitness.",positive
"I have a hard time encouraging myself to workout BUT this studio makes it easy for me to go to! It's always so much fun and I always feel GREAT (sweaty, but great) afterwards!",positive
"Tried this place also from a Groupon since it was close to my house. As another member stated, their spinning class is sub par. They need to look at what their competition is doing. The bikes are older with no readings of your distance or resistance. They don't keep track of your calories burned or heart rate. I think people taking spinning for the first time will feel like this is a great place and people who have gone to other places will think Studio 360 is 10 years behind with the competition. Yes, you do stand the WHOLE time and there is no bar weights to work your upper body. It is so dark that you have to be careful that you don't trip walking into the room. The only lights they have is a dimmer that is directly over the instructor (who's face is about 5 inches from the mirror) and 2 bars of purple neon that they turn on and off. There's no lockers to use so there is shoes and gym bags all over the floor in the front room. I had a lock and opened what I thought was lockers that we could use but when I opened it up, there was old clothes, towels and misc company items stuffed in all the lockers. They stop 4-5 times during a class...Literally STOP for a 20-30 second break. There's no talking, no biking, no music. People actually get off their bikes to go to the restroom. All other spinning places will require you to reserve a spot while this place accepts walk-ins. That should tell you something. I've never gone to a spinning class where people leave before the class is over either. A pro about them is that they are cheaper and one of the trainer had great music - I think his name was Mike. Not for me. Doesn't give a good workout as other places (CycleBar and Madison).",negative
"I am really not into cardio, but I've been coming to this studio for the last 6 years and am simply addicted. Every class is a new challenge and my only goal is to keep going. The instructors are motivating and inspiring and it's always a great group of people that attend. This studio is unique and the classes are exciting and fun while actually focusing on a full body work-out and not just legs. ENJOY!",positive
A key to having a successful business is staying current with the competition and adapting. My recommendation to Studio 360 is check out your competition and adapt. The studio has potential to be great but it's classes are sub par compared to the competition.,negative
"I decided to check out this spin studio because it's right next to my work and it's cheaper than a lot of other spin studios. When I walked in the girl was friendly and asked me if it was my first time, I explained to her that I take spin classes regularly but it's my first time at their studio. She told me to wait for her and she would show me how to use the bike so I told her again I've taken spin classes but it's like it went in one ear and out the other. She took me into the spin room and showed me how to use the bike (by now I had told her 3 times I already knew what I was doing) there were only a few other people in the class. I'm used to taking high energy spin classes and this was the complete opposite. The instructors bike is at the front of the room facing away from everyone so I literally could not tell what she was doing, it just looked like she did the exact same thing the whole class, the music was TERRIBLE, and every few minutes the instructor would turn on a black light for a minute and then turn it back off. There were a few times she actually took breaks and the lights came on and everyone stopped what they were doing, I've NEVER been to a spin class where people stop in the middle of the class. Also, the entire class you are supposed to stand... which makes no sense to me, it gets very repetitive and it's not good for you. I ended up just doing my own thing until the class was over, 2 of the other people in the class even left early. I do not recommend this place and will not be back here. I'll stick to taking classes at The Madison, I would rather pay more for a fun high energy class!",negative
"Bought a Groupon recently to try out Studio 360 just to see if this was a place I would continue attending after my Groupon expired. The first day I walked in I didn't feel welcomed.. might have been because I bought the Groupon, but would expect an establishment to treat me like any other customer. Regardless.. I attended several classes since I love and appreciate a good spin class. The instructors never seemed to be high energy and the music selection wasn't for me. I even left class right when we got into the last cool down. The classes seemed low energy, and continued to feel like the long time clients were of more importance. The Groupon should help build clientele and is a way for new customers to try out an establishment to see if they like it. I was not impressed.",negative
"Still my favorite studio of all time. Nothing fancy or cheesy like all the newer studios. Sam, by far, is the best instructor!",positive
"I found a Groupon for a month of unlimited spinning for Studio 360 and so far I love it. I didn't know how much I would like the ""drop saddle"" (standing most of the time) style but it works. Even though it will be awhile before I can even begin to keep up with the instructors (who are great) and sort of have to go at my own pace, each time I wind up completely drenched in sweat by the end and my fitness tracker said I'd burned 500-600 calories in an hour. GREAT workout! If I can do it, anyone can do it!",positive
Just had a great class with Tom. Brought my teenagers and they also had a great time. Everyone was really friendly and helpful getting two new riders situated. Also appreciated being able to borrow shoes for the girls-thanks!,positive
"A friend of mine brought me here for my first real spin/cycling class. I was very inexperienced and had no idea what I was doing. Not only was the instructor SO helpful in the Thursday 5:30 pm class, but super motivating. She kept encouraging the class and I felt like I got a great workout. Also, all of the riders were helpful and nice as well. No one looked at me like I was dumb for not knowing what I was doing, an experience I have run into as a first timer at other fitness classes. I attended a second class with my friend, a 5:30 am class on Wednesday morning, and despite being tired that class was awesome also. The instructor actually came up and introduced herself to me after the class was over and told me I was doing great. Everyone is super encouraging and I will for sure be back, they were awesome and deserve kudos for it!!",positive
"The class was fine, nothing special, standard spin class without fancy add-one . I appreciated that it was dark so I only concentrated on the riding. I may have gone back but the woman at the reception desk was unbelievably rude. She insulted me more than once and was mad when I didn't want to buy a $80 package instead of the $5 first ride. I don't care if there is a great deal, if I don't like the class I will not return. Too bad they never had the chance thanks to the woman who obviously thought I was below her.",negative
"I needed some fitness and 360Spin fit the bill. I'm a beginner/novice and was made to feel at home. The class was the perfect challenge for any experience level. This was the first time I've ever used "" clip in"" bike shoes, it was easy after the receptionist explained it to me. I've been back for a second class and it was even more fun. Spin cycling to great music with cool instructors in total darkness is awesome.",positive
"This place is pretty cool. I have never done a spin class before and recently came here at a friend's suggestion. We all met up and signed the required paperwork, paid the fee and had a little time to stretch before the session got started. It was definitely different but also fun. Very challenging, especially for a newbie but the instructor was good and it was a dark ride so I did not feel as awkward being new. Every so often black lights turn on as the instructor amps the class up which is a fun touch. The music is pretty decent as well. I definitely got a workout in that is for sure. The only thing I wasn't as much of a fan of was the fact that you have to clip in to the bikes. They have shoes there for you to wear which is fine, but I am not used to riding and being clipped in was a little weird while trying to figure out what was going on in the class. Outside of that, I had a great time. I would come back more often but it is not really close to my house. More than likely I will come back here and there to see where I measure up on the fitness scale as far as cycling. If you like spin classes this is a cool variation to try out.",positive
"I decided to take the plunge and finally try a spinning class. Glad that it was here, a perfect environment to feel like a newbie. (The spin studio is dark, really dark. Arrive with plenty of time to find a bike and to adjust it for your frame & body.) I was greeted at 8:45am by the instructor and spinning phenom, Samantha. She played great music and inspired everyone to push harder.She would turn up the music occasionally when the black light was on, it became also trance or rave- like. After visiting a few more spin classes at the Village on Camelback, I learned that Studio 360 is a stand-up studio (they rarely sit down when riding.) After more spin practice, I will return and see if I can ride standing up the whole time. Sorry that I missed out on the Yoga Studio 360, that segment of the business ended a few months ago.",positive
"This studio was awesome. This was the first time I've ever ridden in the dark. Cycling doesn't seem intense, but it is! The music was really good and I had a lot of fun. The only thing I like better at corebalance was that you can wear your own tennis shoes and don't need to pay for special shoes.",positive
"OK, full disclosure, this was my first ""spin"" class. I'm usually seen on a road bike, and in daylight. The class amazing, the music perfect, attitude great and the work out..fantastic! I will be going back. It was a little difficult to get the 'moves' down that are particular to this studio, but I was told everyone goes through it. Simply put, it was the most fun I've had doing a workout. =) Good job!",positive
"I stumbled across this class by accident. I had done spinning at home in the UK and had tried an LA Fitness class here in Phoenix which was ... ok. I came to Studio 360 and couldn't believe I didn't collapse in a crumpled heap on the floor. Somehow I kept going to the end of the class. It was HARD. I was completely addicted. I have since been going for probably about 6 months. In that time my father in the UK has been diagnosed with a terminal brain tumor and I really can be honest in saying that going to this class 2/3 times a week is the only time when I have 60 minute periods in which I don't feel like I'm crippled with fear and dread about what is happening at home. Oh, and I've dropped 2 dress sizes. It would probably be more, but I REALLY like wine (I'm European. We drink. Too much.) So what my boyfriend affectionately refers to as my ""wine pouch"" reamins. But I have abs underneath. Most importantly - for 60 minutes of the day I feel like a champion. Thank you Studio 360.",positive
"I've been to both Yoga and Spin classes at this studio and really each of them. I'll break them down... Yoga: I have been to almost every yoga studio and town and 360 is definitely one of my favorites. It has a great, open vibe to it and the teachers are fantastic. I've been to 4 or 5 different instructors and they are all really good (Lonnie and Ana are my favorite). I get a good workout - and feel totally energized after. I started going to 360 a few months ago and my yoga was very beginner and I was pretty rusty. But I felt totally comfortable in every class going at my own pace. They've got a lot of different types of classes and a pretty decent schedule. Try them out! Spin: The spin classes were a little overwhelming for me at first. They ride drop saddle (meaning you are standing the whole time) - so that was hard for me to get used to. But, after I went to a few classes I got the hang of it and was able to get an amazing workout. Definitely makes you sweat! Finding a teacher who plays good music is key because it makes the class fly by (Cinnaree and Laura are awesome). I ended up buying my own spin shoes, but they have ones you can borrow at first which I thought was nice. Plus, both types of classes are really reasonably priced compared to other local studios - not easy to find.",positive
"I am taking my 3rd class tonight and I LOVE it! When the hour long spin class is done you will wonder how it went by so fast. The music is loud and the lights are off or dimmed most of the time which for me really takes your mind off the cardio and the burn and keeps you motivated. -Come Early (15 minutes) -Bring water -Bring a small towel -Don't have shoes? You can borrow! -Prepare for an amazing workout and a lot of fun! If you haven't done spinning before don't worry, I did my first class with at beginner and she was fine. Just make sure you tell the front desk person that you are new and they will take great care of you!",positive
"Love spinning here! It's always a hard workout and I've only been to the beginner classes - can't imagine what the advanced ones are like. The Mon and Wed evening teachers are great and play fun music. After a crazy day at work, this is the perfect outlet and a great way to clear your mind. The only other spin class I've done were at LA Fitness - these are 100x better. It's intense, you never sit down, black lights and fun music and everyone is super nice and helpful. I've been coming here for more than a year and would recommend it to anyone!",positive
"I stumbled on this studio through Living Social and I'm so glad I did. It's a small studio with only one room but it's really the perfect size for me. Although I typically look to yoga for the mental practice as much as the physical, this is more PHYSICAL than I realized I could do. The classes in the A.M. have the same poses and flows daily but it does NOT make it easier. It increases my heart rate and has me pouring in sweat and sore the next day but it's not too much that it should scare off any other newbies like myself. I'm absolutely addicted and really dig the instructors. I will say I liked the studio the first week I went prior to the new decorating. Although the mural in the studio is lovely it just had a very modern and clean feeling before. I also liked it without the curtains. Either way, it makes zero difference, the classes are great!",positive
"I went to Studio 360 for the second time last week and ironically enough, the instructor had read my Yelp review and remembered that I liked it hotter. This was a different instructor than the first one I had (sorry can't remember eithers names), but she was so nice and accomodating. She suggested I move to the far right side of room, where there was a space heater set up so I got the extra heat. Burned up a great sweat and was super happy :) I really appreciated the fact that Studio took my comments to heart. This instructor was also slightly more fast paced, which I enjoyed.",positive
"Why don't they list descriptions of their yoga classes online? Why, when I inquired was I not provided with one? Just so I am clear: A description of yoga classes included not only the times and days of each class...not just the name of the instructor...the type of yoga and whether it is a beginner, moderate or advanced class is pretty standard. Also, the living social or groupon link to the site brings you to a random website that isn't their official one. Scary.",negative
"This place is AMAZING!! Best hour workout I've ever experienced and I've tried everything!! Great teachers and people, awesome energy and just A LOT of fun! I am so hooked!! I dont see how anyone can say a bad thing about this place, except for that they simply can't handle a true, intense workout.",positive
"If I could separate the Yoga Studio 360 and the Spinning 360, here is how my Rating would look: Yoga 360: Four Stars - I am brand new at Yoga, but I've always wanted to try it for the workout and to strengthen my weak neck and back. I've been every Tuesday for the past three weeks and it's been amazing every time. Dana is great and she really helped me my first day to get my bearings. Literally yesterday I convinced myself to get a membership to this club because of their Yoga... until I went to today's Spin Class Spinning 360: 1 Star - On their website, it makes new riders feel very welcome. Again, I am brand new to spinning. They suggested to come early, get set up with free shoes and they'll ""introduce you"" to the bike. So today I got there 15 minutes early and was excited when I saw 10-15 people milling around, chatting and laughing like a group of friends. Unfortunately the girl behind the counter did not acknowledge my existence for literally 10 minutes. It was becoming comically frustrating. By the time she got me signed in and a pair of shoes the class had started. Trying to clip into a bike when you've never done it before with all of the lights out and music thumping is impossible... so I walked out. It was embarassing and a waste of time. I'm sure this isn't how it is always, but unfortunately my month ends soon, so I / they won't have a second chance. I'll finish out my month of Yoga classes next week and instead of signing up for another month... I'll find a different studio.",negative
Wow!!! I just took a spinning class from Ty and it was great! I had a knee replacement 10 years ago and have not been able to run since. I have done other cardio workouts but nothing compared to running. This class gave me that 'runner's high' I so enjoy. Ty is a sweetheart and very motivating. She uses a terrific mix of music too.,positive
This is more than just a spin class. This is a mind altering experience that combines incredible music with exercise in the dark. It is more than exercise and more like therapy.,positive
"I love studio 360!! It is an Arcadia institution. If you live in Arcadia and you have not been here...that's fine because I don't want you taking my bike, but you really are missing out! If you like working out in a group without feeling like everyone is staring at you this is perfect because it's dark (with the exception of the occasional black light). Spinning at 360 is group exercise but like yoga it is individual with a sense of group support. It is drop saddle style, so you stand the entire class, which I actually find easier than the alternative. It's good for people who enjoy dance as well, it is very rhythmic. Best work out I have ever had, but you don't have to be a work out freak to enjoy 360. The instructors are great. If you are new to it I suggest Tues night with Denise. Always show up at least 15 minutes early to get a spot and learn how to ride. Their motto is ""to see the light you have to ride like hell in the dark"" :) Enjoy!",positive
This place might well be cited for disturbing the peace. On week-end mornings one can often hear the throbbing bass beat inside of other nearby businesses and even out in the parking lot. The ambience reminds me of a low-rider with one of those souped-up stereos that you can feel coming down the road long before you can hear it. Seems like I've been front and center at punk rock shows that had less prominent bass lines than this place has on Sunday mornings.,negative
Spinning. Hardcore. That about sums it up. Give it a try if you want a workout that will totally kick your ass and leave you crying.,positive

"I tried several gyms in the Summerlin/Las Vegas area, and Summerlin Crossfit was by far the best for me. The coaches are all extremely knowledgeable, and always helping teach and correct technique. Classes are just the right size (enough people to keep you motivated, but not so many that it's crowded and the coaches can't keep an eye on everyone). The other participants are very friendly and great company during a workout. I always enjoy my time there. There's a good mix of beginners and experienced athletes. Mike (the owner) knows everyone, and he is always looking for ways to make the gym better, by adding new types of classes or getting new equipment. I'm hooked, and look forward to going to the gym every chance I get.",positive
"As a consultant, I'm traveling a lot for my job and I visited 20 different CrossFit nationally and internationally in the last 4 years. This one in Summerlin is different for the following reasons: - The coaches are always paying attention to you and correct you if you need to. I need a lot of it as I'm not the best synchronized athlete - The classes are rarely packed, and you know all the family' members - The Box is super clean which is not the case for most of them, to be honest. No Smell, No dust. This is the best Crossfit place I've visited so far.",positive
"I've been working out in different gyms my whole life and there is nothing better than training at Summerlin Crossfit. The coaches, the facility and the members make it a great experience for newbies or people who have been in the gym their whole lives. I've been a member for about 3 years and I never plan on leaving here unless I were to move out of state. It's motivating, challenging and fun! Thanks for all your help SCF!",positive
"I've been cross fitting for many years and in different states/cities... This box is just amazing for ALL the reasons. There is not one coach here that doesn't know what they're doing! Each one is unique in what they bring to the table, but they're all very skilled, positive and motivating. As for the schedule- best I've ever seen! Even has Sunday times! That NEVER happens! The people that we workout with are all shapes and sizes, no egos, and everyone is very encouraging. Please do yourself a favor and check this place out, you will be welcomed!",positive
"I have thought I would be into Crossfit, but thanks to this gym I'm hooked! Chris is extremely professional and welcoming. He us so helpful and really takes his time to make sure his athletes and new members are accomodated. Mike very well versed in his coaching, techniques and strength building which has got me going on the weekends. The people: amazing. But you should come try it out and see for yourself! You'll find me here at the 7pm- I love this place that much.",positive
"Awesome place with awesome people running it! Chris is a very professional and sincere trainer who will work with you to perfect your form before moving on to more advanced work outs. He is patient and kind, motivating you to do the move correctly so that your body does not get injured while working out. I highly recommend this gym!",positive
I'm visiting this box from out of the area. I felt very welcome from the moment I walked in. The owner Chris was very helpful and nice. I definitely recommend and will be going back when I'm in the area.,positive
"If you are looking for a FRIENDLY, CLEAN and FUN place, this is it! I looked at all the xfit places in town and asked so many friends what they recommend. And I decided to do my own and settled on this place. I am SO HAPPY I did! They will cater to what you can handle. And sometimes what you can handle is more than you think! They push you but not by screaming at you or working you till you throw up. Instead they use friendly words of encouragement. The owner, Chris, is RIDICULOUSLY NICE! I highly recommend this place! Come join me! See you there!",positive
"I have never been a workout person. I've always hated sweating and regular gyms are always SO boring and do absolutely nothing to boost my motivation. I snagged a Groupon for Summerlin CrossFit last year, thinking that it's cheap & if I might as well give it a try... and have been completely hooked ever since! Everyone here is so nice and it didn't even bother me that I was last for every WOD. Everyone cheers you on after they're done - ""Almost there, keep it up!"" and the hi-fives afterward help keep you motivated & push you forward. I've always felt pretty socially awkward but everyone here really does treat you like family from the beginning and it's so amazing! The WODs will leave you unbelievably sore afterward but keep going back... the only way to get past the soreness is to do it again! Completing them makes me feel so powerful and seeing the difference from week to week in my body is definitely a huge encouragement. The results are truly amazing - I didn't drop weight because I gained muscle but I went down two dress sizes in 4 months! This is truly the best gym I've ever been to and I would (and have!) recommend it to anyone who is looking to start out or those just looking for a new box - you don't be disappointed.",positive
"I had been thinking about Crossfit for a while, obsessively reading yelp reviews and trying to figure out who I was going to give my $150 for an intro course when a Groupon for Summerlin Crossfit appeared. Everyone in the gym is extremely welcoming. The coaches knew my name right away and I am never silently waiting for class to start - someone says hi always. I thought I was in ok shape until my first class. We reviewed movements, practiced form, got feedback, and tried a mini WOD. One round into it I thought I was going to vomit. I knew Crossfit was about being hardcore and pushing yourself, so I was a little worried that the coaches would try to tell me to keep going. No worries though! They were super nice, could see that I was ill, and talked to me about breathing. I didn't even finish my first WOD, but they told me to come back, so I did. I finished my intro courses and bought a monthly membership (they discount for teachers!) I love the Crossfit classes and am very excited that they've added a yoga class to the calendar.",positive
Came here for the TRX classes and was very pleased! Great gym and good people! Highly recommended if you're looking for a great TRX place.,positive
"I am a triathlete that has a hard time fitting in a full weight lifting schedule. I've starting doing Crossfit just over a month ago to help me develop more functional strength throughout my upper body, core and legs. This was definitely a plus to my training. Working at Summerlin Crossfit is awesome. Chris and Mike are so supportive and provide a great atmosphere that is challenging, but not threatening. They work with everyone to guide improvement, friendly competition and most importantly camaraderie among all participants. If you are thinking of Crossfit, you are doing yourself wrong if you don't check out this gym. You won't be disappointed.",positive
"I had been an avid crossfitter for about a year and a half when I moved to Las Vegas in October of 2012. One of my first priorities was to find a new crossfit box I could call home. I researched and visited a couple of gyms before coming into Summerlin Crossfit and was disappointed by the other places. The staff is amazing here and welcomed me with open arms! They gave me great deals to start off and I am totally hooked now! This is not just a gym to work out in, it is a motivating environment where everyone soon becomes family. Chris and Mike are very knowledgable and can help anyone achieve their fitness goals. I have found my new crossfit home at Summerlin Crossfit and I am here to stay. I would recommend this gym to anyone that wants a challenge, wants to meet their fitness goals, and wants to make some great friends along the way : )",positive
"With so many CrossFit gyms in Las Vegas it is often hard to choose one to work out at--but I believe Summerlin CrossFit is truly the best in town! My husband & I joined Summerlin CrossFit in October (2012) and couldn't be happier! Chris & Mike are extremely knowledgable trainers and push us to our fullest extent during workouts. They will scale the WOD for each member depending on his/her fitness level, injuries, etc. The camaraderie with Chris, Mike, and the fellow CrossFitters is amazing. Everyone is there to motivate & help one another. I truly look forward to going every day to work out and hang out with everyone who I now consider my ""CrossFit Family."" Since starting CrossFit, my running times have greatly improved. As an avid runner for the past 10+ years, this has been amazing. I am also feeling so much stronger than I was with my previous non-CrossFit workout regimen. Besides giving us butt-kicking WODs each day, Chris & Mike are extremely knoweldegable in mobility & flexibility. They make sure to lead us through extensive warm-up exercises and stretches prior to every workout. I LOVE Summerlin CrossFit and my ""CrossFit Family!!"" :)",positive
"Since I began going to Summerlin Crossfit three months ago, I have not went to another gym. While I primarily attend crossfit, the great part about this place is that in addition to crossfit, it has TRX classes, spin classes, personal training and even Barre. I have done all of the above except for Barre. Chris and Mike are both incredible coaches and they take individual time to assist you -- whether it be in reaching a particular goal, working on a particular exercise or focusing on a sore spot or stiff muscle. In addition, they make workouts fun. There is a real sense of community here. If you have never done crossfit, what are you waiting for? But be careful, it is addictive. Not only is it good for the body, but it is good for the spirit as well.",positive
Absolutely amazing place! I had to make a yelp account just so I could review them and give them the credit they deserve. The staff is incredibly friendly and always willing to give you any extra help you might need on any of the moves. This was my first time starting CrossFit so I was really unsure about whether I would like it or not. But after coming here I tell everyone I know that if they're thinking about starting then they need to come here.,positive
This place is great ! I am new to crossfit and was very nervous to start . The coaches are very patient and great and explaining and helping you understand the moves. They make sure that you don't hurt yourself. You will get a great workout and a lot of encouragement to push yourself. It's a lot of work but I always look forward to going back !,positive
"After look in another places we Chose stay in Syndicate and let me tell you that was our best decision, the classes are amazing ! Coaches are awesome, all the staff and people here are Pretty nice ! Don't look in any other place! My boyfriend and I love this place !! Come and try! You won't regret it :)",positive
"My wife went to this gym with our 3 and 4 year old boys to look into some after school programs. We were very reluctant to place our children in the program because we thought they were too young, but the sale person at the register assured us they would give us a chance to try it out and if it did not work out, they would issue a refund to us. I came in with my wife to discuss this with them and this is what we both were promised. Unfortunately, our children did not enjoy the class, they were distracted and it did not work out. It was obvious that they were too young and not ready so we pulled them out and informed the Donny (the guy who signed us up) that we would not continue the class and we did want the refund. He assured us that we would get a refund. After not receiving a refund, we get this response: "" I apologize for the delay in response- I wanted to make sure I went over the case thoroughly. I also apologize that someone at the desk said that you would receive a refund;it is not our policy to issue refunds in cases like yours. Nevertheless we would like to offer to meet you half way and refund you half of your initial payment."" We do not want half of our money back. Our kids showed up for less than 1 full session and we pulled them out as we had discussed with Donny. It is upsetting when you visit a business and they lie to you. It is also upsetting when the business does not stand behind their employees promises, even if they don't agree with them. I would be careful when doing business with Syndicate MMA and make sure you don't get promises they won't deliver.",negative
"The best of the best are created at this gym. Everyone here trains hard and encourages you to do the same. The staff is really nice and will make you feel very comfortable. They provide a variety of different equipment and classes ranging from Brazilian ju jitsu, Muay Thai, kids programs and strength/conditioning classes. The coaches are great and the atmosphere is nice too. If you are looking for somewhere you can actually for us and work out. This is the place to come..",positive
"So its my first night at Syndicate ever, I've just finished a boxing class with Jason (it was awesome) and I'm sitting on the bleachers pretty convinced I'm going to join this gym. And then... GSP walks in the door to train for the Jonny Hendricks fight. Yes, thats right, GSP. Any doubt about joining instantly went out the window, and the fan boy in me muttered a meek ""Hey GSP"" when he walked past. Lol. Syndicate is a about as good as it gets in terms of an MMA gym. I've been to more than a few gyms, and often they are uninviting, click-ish, and full of ""tough guys"". Syndicate is nothing like this. The minute you walk in both Nate and Casey are extremely friendly, do not pressure you to buy anything, and are more than willing to show you around and even let you try a few classes to see if this is a fit for you. You can see from the first day that although some students truly desire to be fighters, others are training for general fitness or overall knowledge. Either way, you'll fit right in. If your thinking about joining a gym of any sort, come here and give it a try. You won't be disappointed!",positive
"We took are son here. They told the cut off age was 5 years. My son went there enjoy, his time an then. Not even the owner dosnt come out an tell us anything. Only one of here employees came up to us an example. We make expsions, for 5 years olds. If they can, get through the class, an they don't slow down the other student he is included in the class. If she told my wife that the children start at 6 years of age. We would not have wasted are time today. The owner of the company or neither a trainer came up to us an said. How are son do, or, if he did good or bad. As the owner of this company see should came up to us an gave us some insights. Or answers. I would be spectacle of this place . They just want your money. They don't offer any information or insight or even any instructions on your child. An then they misinform you on there age, just to get you inside the door. This owner is very unprofessional an should not be running, this business or any other business. Very poor business practice.",negative
"The instructors are awesome. They have lots of energy and they provide great instructions on how to box properly. The gym is very clean and the people who go there are very nice. It feels like a big family. Also, the owner, Blakey, is simply an awesome person!",positive
"I needed a gym while I was out in Las Vegas for a week and decided to check out Title Boxing Club. This is definitely a gym you want to go to and check out if you're looking for that high energy in a workout!!! The staff is very welcoming, with a no pressure feel. You definitely get that family vibe and comradery from the staff and all the members make you feel welcome and at home. I took a boxing class with coach Tyler and he kept everyone's heart rate pumping and cooled things down at the right times. I will definitely come by next time I'm in Las Vegas for a few days to get my workout on!!!!",positive
I recently joined & I love this gym! I feel comfortable there and all the instructors are super nice. Best place I have boxed at yet. The workouts are fun & challenging! I highly recommend going and trying a class.,positive
"The staff and the club overall are wonderful. I think what does it for me is how friendly and fun they make this place. I first heard about a boxing and brunch event from Facebook. I found the place to be very spacious and inviting! Blakele, Tyler and Ronnie are super nice and welcoming. I've been to two of their boxing and brunch events. They also host a glow event where they hire a DJ, turn down the lights and give you how in the dark bracelets. If it wasn't so far for me, I would probably have a membership. The workouts kick my butt every time and I can't wait to go back for some more!",positive
"This is the gym where everyone is treated like family. Every staff member is friendly and always greet you with a happy face. Each workout is as intense as you want it to be and I have to admit I have an addiction to the best hour of my day, everyday. You don't have to worry about the people around you during the workout because each workout it's just between you and the bag.",positive
"It's a great work out! It's fun, stress relieving, and you burn a lot of calories! It's amazing the change I've seen in some of the members! The music is always pumping, I love it! I have to mention that Blakele classes are tough, which is why I love them! Individual technique classes are available too, all the trainers are awesome and very friendly.",positive
"What a great workout! Josh usually kicks our butts at 6am, The Breakfast Club, but today the owner, Blakele, did the honors! I literally had to give myself a pep talk to get out of my car and walk into work, between the warm up, 8 rounds and the core work out! I will be back again tomorrow to spend that first hour of the day working on me! Thanks to all the great trainers and great facility at Title Henderson!",positive
"Just became a member at Title Boxing and I'm so impressed with this gym. It's clean, classes are intense and coaches are outstanding. Special shoutout to Josh and Blakely for kicking my butt daily at 6am. Truly appreciate YOU and the gym.",positive
"My friends invited me to try this spot out. I said, ""Why not?"" Turns out it was a super cool experience. As soon as I walked into the facility, every single staff member working went out of their way to come over and introduce themself to me and say hello. I met Blakele, Ria, Vanessa and Ronnie. And their friendliness was not just for me, I noticed they greeted all their regulars in the same manner. I love seeing that as you don't see much of this at many places. I can tell they treat everyone like family here. It was a breath of fresh air. Ronnie was our boxing instructor for the day. He'a just awesome. Very helpful in prepping me for what to expect in the class. Once class started, it was intense. But a good intense. The boxing workout is no joke. It works every part of your body!!! EVERYTHING!!! And to be honest, I had fun and I felt like a total badass. I enjoyed this class. I can also see how going to regular classes would get anyone in shape. I'm bringing the husband next time. Totally a cool experience. I'm telling everyone about this place!!!",positive
"I have been a member of UFC for 8 years, and was invited for a workout today at Title Boxing. I was totally in awe of what an incredible workout we had. Its like going from high school football, to playing in the Super Bowl. The owner is great, as was the trainer, Josh. I highly recommend you give it a try. its only a mile from the UFC on Eastern, but light years ahead on service, workout, and intensity",positive
"Seriously one of the most comfortable, clean, and technically sound boxing gyms I have been to, and I have only taken their free class. I have been training on and off since 2006 and been to gyms from California to Vegas in its MMA heyday. Just give it a go, you won't regret it.",positive
I've been coming here for a little over a month now and I'm in as good as shape now as I was when I was running high school track. It's the best workout in town! Not to mention how exhilarating it is landing stronger and stronger punches week after week. I would recommend this place to anyone regardless of gender or age. You get out of it what you want to put in!!! Oh and every single trainer seriously rocks,positive
"I love Title! We have been coming here since they opened and what a transformation! I say we since my whole family of 4 comes with me. The workouts are good for my 12 and 16year old as well. The staff is very friendly and knowledgeable about adjustments needed for all the workouts. We do boxing/kickboxing classes, we personal train there and participate in the boot camp classes when they have them. It's a great workout guaranteed to burn 500-1000 calories. I would rather spend an hour here burning calories than at the gym on a treadmill any day! If you haven't tried it...You should! It's fun! The hour flies by!",positive
"A great Boxing and Fitness Club. This isn't a gym and you really do feel like part of a family. Dubbed the ""friendliest club in town"", you have to come in and meet the members and staff to find out why. Ownership is top notch and truly cares about the members needs. This club is run with a high amount of integrity and is a great environment to meet your fitness goals.",positive
"I love coming here. The trainers are awesome and really friendly. It's a high energy, family-like environment that makes working out fun. I used to weight lift and do cardio at a regular gym, but this workout is better than any weight lifting mixed with cardio I've ever done. If you don't like to workout or you're looking to switch up your current workout, go to Title. I guarantee you'll absolutely love it.",positive
"This is the most amazing gym! I've always been and runner and never even considered boxing as something I'd like to do bc I don't care for gyms. One of my friends convinced me to go bc I need to build my upper body strength for a race, and I fell in love! Everyone is super friendly, the trainers are fun and make the classes exciting, and people of all ages and skill levels participate...which makes it a blast! Highly recommend this gym!!",positive
"Just started two weeks ago. Very clean and well-organized facility. The staff members are very friendly and helpful. All levels can work out, and the trainers work well with all levels. I especially like getting a great workout in, while relieving stress and frustrations. It is definitely worth the free class they give to give it a try.",positive
"If you are looking to amp up your workout or just starting your fitness Journey this is the gym to be at! It's great for all fitness levels. All the instructors are full of knowledge, skills, and passion. The classes will pump you up so much that even tho you are sweating your butt off the hour goes by fast. I highly recommend title boxing for your next workout !",positive
"Love this place! All of the trainers are wonderful. Very high energy and they really do create a family-like atmosphere. No matter how tired I am after work, I still always want to go to Title for a session because I feel so great afterwards. Boxing works muscles I didn't even know I had! It's also the best stress reliever. If you're looking for a new way to get in shape that doesn't involve running (I am NOT the running type), this is PERFECT. Feel excellent, make new friends, and gain new skills. Worth every penny. The warm ups are very intense, but the trainers always remind us to pace ourselves and provide modifications for each move. The eight rounds of boxing/kickboxing fly by, then core. The core workout is pretty rough also, but this is where I definitely notice improvement in my strength and abilities to perform exercises I could not in the past. Come join our Title family!",positive
Great place to burn 1000 plus calories per session. The facility is First Class with high energy Trainers that know how to Motivate!!! I Love this place,positive
Great place! Totally impressed n I'll let the pics speak. Everyone is nice n felt like family with history. The class cousins son took wAs awesome n he enjoyed it!,positive
This is my favorite place to tan. I've also used the red light therapy stand up bed here and I liked it more than the lay down RLT bed at the last salon I was going to. Friendly staff and reasonable prices and weekend tanning specials compared to other tanning salons. Love that they're open late too!,positive
"Love this place! Have gone there for 4 spray tans in the Versa spray machine they have on level 2. Such a natural looking tan and not orange at all. They also have great prices. The workers are always welcoming and friendly. If you're looking for a great natural-looking spray tan, go here",positive
"Their beds are hot and put on an awesome base in just one session, however I have olive skin and tan fairly easily. Had everything I need right there! Service is excellent too! I look forward to going back!",positive
Helpful and friendly customer service (I'm not sure of his name) and I got great color from the level three bed right before a trip.,positive
I usually go to a different tanning company BUT this place was the only place open after I got off work (there hours are AMAZING) so I figured why not try it out. WOW it was amazing! Not only was the staff very welcoming but the facility is super clean and the versa booth was SO much faster than at the place I usually go to! I WILL be back!!!!,positive
"This review is about my first, ever ""spray tan."" I elected to have this done as I had just had a cancerous mole removed from my lower cheek. I figured this is a ""safer"" way to get a tan than spending more time out in the sun plus I was headed to California to visit family. I went in on Tuesday to take advantage of the Half Off Spray Tan pricing offered. The male receptionist (didn't get his name) explained that there are ""three levels"" of spray tan that can be purchased. The higher the number, the darker the spray tan. I decided on a level two spray tan with skin conditioning spray which is supposed to make your tan last longer than four-five days. I was taken into the room which had a Versa Spray tan machine( See video- https://youtu.be/xiXGZ2EHMjM ). They explained how to operate the machine and demonstrated each of the FOUR body positions I would assume in order to maximize my spray tan. I was also shown how to prep your hands finger nails and toes with lotion to keep the spray tan from coloring these parts of your body. Since it was a private room, I was advised to strip off all my clothing (after he left), and lock the door. I followed the instructions as given and came out of the machine with a great ""tan!"" As a side note, I drove 25 miles to Tangible Tanning, and it was definitely worth it ! Not only will I go back, I will bring my wife also; probably, next week..",positive
"I had the BEST experience in spray tanning ever....Jake was beyond friendly and helpful. I purchased the groupon and from prior experiences with other companies, my expectations were pretty low but I was blown away. The space is welcoming and smelled great and I felt completely at ease. The drive is a little far for me but after my first impression I would much rather drive an extra few minutes to get the amazing service. Not to mention the spray looks fantastic- not orangey and no streaking. Way to Go Tangible Tanning :)",positive
This place is amazing! I go on Tuesdays during their spray tan special. Jake at the front desk provides exceptional customer service. He is very knowledgeable about their products and services and he always has a super positive attitude. Highly recommend!,positive
"Wow i know i just stumbled upon the coolest place called Tangible Tanning .i received the best massage EVER by Jason.He was very professional,attentative to my concerns and the room and music made me feel like i was floating in Bali waters .The entire place is a must see and i definetley will be back . The No Pressure thing has got to make this place ... The Place to Be in 2017!",positive
"I am new to the area and by good fortune ran across a Groupon for this great spot! Had my first tanning session today and let me just say this I've been to many tanning salons throughout the valley and Tangible Tanning has really impressed me! They are knowledgeable, friendly and very helpful, I'm already looking forward to my next session!",positive
"This place is awesome! It's really cute and clean, a very comfortable atmosphere. There are other closer tanning salons to my apartment, but I prefer to drive the extra couple miles for the excellent service and quality of tanning beds/spray tan. It must be said that Jake is wildly fabulous and incredibly knowledgeable on all things tanning! He's a diamond in the rough, truly one hell of a guy. I'm hooked.",positive
"Full disclosure: I'm a tanning snob. I've been going for years and I have extremely high standards for cleanliness, customer service, cost and bed quality. That being said, I've been a member here for almost a year and I'm not going anywhere! Except maybe their new gym/salon when it opens. The cost is comparable to most of the salons in the valley, but Tangible is the only one that seems worth the money. The beds are immaculately clean every time and they've got a wide variety to choose from. The staff is friendly and they've got a great selection of products to choose from. Did I mention they're open long hours so you can go (almost) whenever? Now onto the gym; I have a membership to it but embarrassingly have yet to use it. The gym seems well stocked, clean, and not too busy at any time of the day. I'll update this review if I ever make it over there lol.",positive
"These guys are great! I burn very easily and need to get a tan before Jamaica! They explained the differences between the beds, and helped me figure out a max time to be in a bed without burning!! They're always friendly and helpful, and always have a smile for you when you walk through the door! The beds and rooms are always clean, I am quite satisfied with Tangible Tanning!",positive
Very sweet and welcoming staff! They have nice products for tanning as well as nutritional items. Very clean and professional! I will be back,positive
"Only the greatest gym in the world. This is where I can work out, tan, get my hair done, buy my supplements at rock bottom prices, attend a yoga class, drop off my dry cleaning, buy top of the line scented candles, make a Christmas charity donation, get a massage and my eyebrows waxed now. Allllll with the friendliest, most helpful and tolerant staff I've ever seen anywhere. What the hell else could you possibly ask for? Very reasonable membership prices without any contract drama? Great hours? Spotlessly clean environment? Plenty of equipment that's not constantly taken over by excess members? The great feeling that comes from knowing you're supporting a local business run by amazing people who deserve and appreciate your business? Check, check, check, check and check! I made the mistake of joining Gold's Gym and 24 hr Fitness. I learned my lesson. I started coming here just to tan a few years back and they've now won over my whole family forever. What we need is a group package! There are tons of trainers around which I personally want nothing to do with, but they're all nice and don't bother us in any way. There's never any pressure of sales or nickle and diming. It feels like we know everyone there and they know us right back. I know the place is moving soon and we just pray they stay close, because we would be traumatized to have to go elsewhere. We love you guys!",positive
Very helpful and friendly staff. Went in for a massage and now on the massage plan :) If you need a massage Tanner can work on you and make you feeling better!,positive
"I love this salon! I went in there today, they were so nice and clean! Cleanliness is such a big thing for me because I have tanned at most the tanning salon in the valley it hard to find a good one. They were amazing and I can't wait to come back. They also have versa spa spray tan! I love that!",positive
Went there for indoor tanning and what quite impressed with how polite the two gentlemen that helped me were. Overall a great experience.,positive
Chris was really helpful and took the time to explain the process to me for the spray tanning booth. I look forward to returning!,positive
"One happy Elite Yelper here. I am a newer member to this facility. My trainer introduced me to Tangibles July of this year. I am quite impressed with the quality of making you feel at home service.I have always been a member of larger gym facilities which did not offer that personal touch. A Tangible's every customer is immediately greeted by first name with a smile no matter what time of day it is. The location is ""VERY"" clean with fresh towel service for members. It is a smaller gym with plenty of the latest machines. No waiting to use your favorite fitness workout machine. Plenty of room with a variety of machine options. The gym offers a variety of services from classes, trainers, tanning, salon services and much more. Be sure to review the website for daily specials. Highlights: Tangibles is services and memberships are affordable. Clean restroom facilities. Staff very welcoming Early and later hours 7 days a week. Top certified trainers Salon services to include cellulite reduction, massages, and much much more.",positive
"Upon first moving here 2 years ago, I had the worse experience attempting to get an airbrush spray tan at this salon. They had only 2 people at specific times that could spray you custom. No problem showed up and the tech could not figure out how to use the gun. So awkward enough him being a male and standing there naked, I oopted to get my money back after waiting 20 min. Well a couple months back they ran a deal for Versa, Which is a booth spray tan. I love this booth..it is like airbrushing but private, and this spray tan absolutely does not smell or stain your sheets! I found this upon leaving Denver, CO. and just fogot until I saw it online oneday on living deals for Amazon.:) one down two to go..all for $29 :) love! As far as the gym goes, never used it!",positive
"What happened here???? I go away for a bit and come back and the place turns to Clownville? Tangible,I've got to say I'm disappointed. The prices have gone up and the customer service has gone to shit. It's gotten overrun with gymbunnies/rats who meander near the equipment doing not much more than staring at themselves flex. Then there's the proliferation of independant personal trainers. There's no one on staff that can tell you how to use the machines if you're new,and if you can't afford or want to use an independant trainer,you're left to flounder and feel foolish. To the faux Jillian trainer,could you stop yelling at your clients from across the damn gym?This is not your reality show,you sound like an ass.I don't go to the gym to be subjected to your showboating and frankly,you're obnoxious. Unfortunatley,this is the only game in town for me at the moment. I only hope as the holidays near,the place will empty out somewhat. I used to love this gym,now I simply tolerate it.",negative
"Love, love.....LOVE this place, super cool people work out there, you walk in and spend a few minutes waving and acknowledging people. The equipment is great, it is never so packed you stand around wondering what machine you can get in on. The trainers there are great....so worthwhile to invest in a little kick start. It is not oriented just towards ""muscle""....it seems the trainers incorporate fitness, cardio, core in their programs and you can see all kinds of ages and diversities there. Did I mention that I love it??? They have now opened up for 24hrs during the week and the monthly fees are mindblowingly reasonable!! I must say it is super close to my house, but if I didn't love it sooooo much I still wouldn't go.Staff are uber friendly too.",positive
"Everything you need to meet your fitness goals- Weight, Supplements, Educated trainers. Small, but doesn't get busy-especially now with the open area. Inexpensive- No contract, sign-up, or cancellation fee's Amenities- Complimentary lockers and towels Not the stuffiness of an""LA Fitness- style"" gym",positive
Super clean! Friendly staff who are always working not just sitting behind a counter. Owner is a great guy and the membership price cant be beat. i switched to here from another downtown gym and couldnt be happier.,positive
"I've been going to this gym for awhile now, and even though it's gone under many management changes, it's still a good gym. Membership is $20/month charged via EFT. No initiation or cancellation fees. I've never had to cancel, but I was told it's as easy as calling in before the monthly charge hits your account. Plenty of cardio machines, all with TVs. Lots of strength training equipment. Their open/stretching area could use some work, it's the only indoor space available for stretching, plyometrics, jump roping, etc. They usually have good, commercial free, workout music playing inside the whole gym. Free lockers and towels too.",positive
"My wife found this place a few months back... she was just looking for a decent tanning salon close to our house in downtown phoenix... She mentioned to me that it had a small gym connected, and that I should look into a membership there since I was between gyms. Finally, months later we decided to check it out together.... what she originally thought was a ""small"" gym, turned out to be a rather large gym, equipped with updated weight machines, benches, free weights, treadmills, etc! And the price CANNOT BE BEAT!! It's a no brainer! Plus we get 50% off tanning as gym members! Which comes in handy for evening out that nasty tan line....",positive
"I really like this gym. Just began going. I'm working with a personal trainer - Lorel Stevens. Saw someone else mentioned her as well. She is fantastic! I moved gyms with her when the other place she worked closed. This gym is very clean and modern. The equipment looks new and is well maintained. Typically in the mornings it isn't too crowded. The owners are very nice. While the place is small and doesn't offer classes like the large chains, it has a nice set up and is easy to work with machines or free weights. Lots of cardio options. A workout area in the back where you can do some stretching, sit ups, etc. I think I'm really going to like this place!",positive
"Recently my trainer moved gyms. I was hesitant about moving places because I really liked the intimacy of the former place. After visiting Tangible Tanning & Fitness a few times I signed up for a membership. No contracts - love that! Price was reasonable. The gym is relatively small. The cardio equipment have tvs attached so you can sweat and watch your favorite show. Just plug in your own ear phones and away you go. I did look at a few other gyms in the area. The employees at LA Fitness were so rude when I didn't sign a contract on the spot. It was such a turn off. Tangible Fitness is family owned by a mother and her daughter (love that fact) To top it off, they are very nice. I'm just starting back to the gym after a few years of not doing anything. I love the fact that it is a comfortable enviornment with all shapes and sizes present. I especially like the variety of things to do there and I can set my own pace. Yesterday it was boxing and weights. Today was cardio and some yoga exercises. Lorel Stevens is my trainer there and she is the best!!! Love her!",positive
UPDATE! Apparently are now staying open! Yay! Looking for a new gym was depressing me! --------------------------- I just got word that Tangible Tanning & Fitness is closing down the fitness center at the end of February... (Tanning salon remain open) So depressed. Finding a comparable gym will not be easy or fun! Sad to see you go!,positive
"Staff at the front desk were friendly, but the facility is old and musty. The pool is closed until spring and the locker rooms were really gross and dirty. I wouldn't recommend coming here.",negative
"I recently joined this YMCA after being a member at an upscale gym (Total Woman) for 10 years. I really did not think I was going to like working out at the ""Y"" at all. However, I was pleasantly surprised to find there is a great selection of free weights, Nautilus equipment, and various other machines. What's also great is there are several work out floors/rooms, and they offer a variety of classes. Mostly snowbirds and retirees work out at this location. However, there are some young people working out there too! This would be a great option for a family or a family with kids/teenagers, as they have a pool, pool table, and shuffle board at this location. In my opinion, the best part of this gym is the mellow vibe. Everyone is cool and for females you won't have to worry about having unwanted males interrupting your set. However, you may still encounter some ""old dudes"" checking out your form!",positive
"I recently rejoined YMCA because the price is affordable, the equipment is just what I need and I love how non judgmental this place feels. No makeup/selfie taking girls, and no guys huffing and puffing over at the weights. The building itself is sorta outdated and could use some work but in December they got new equipment (treadmills, bikes, etc) and it's a nice update.",positive
"Staff try to help but are often clueless about schedules, changes, events, programs. Why is that? People at the front desk are our first line of defense for information and should not be clueless. They have programs to help kids but no one at the front desk knows anything about donations of funds or gifts. WHY? Today I was told a gift donation program was cancelled, when in fact it was not. These are gifts for kids in need and to tell someone the program was cancelled hurts these kids. The program was not in the computer and the staffer only knew what he could find in the computer, and did not bother to listen to which program I was asking about. Very dysfunctional Y. To make things worse administrators don't respond to members' comments or ideas. Why do they bother with a box for suggestions, if they ignore them--or maybe just toss them? And the major exercise classroom is freezing all the time!",negative
"Sign up your kids for sports at this dysfunctional YMCA if you want to be lied to, overcharged, shorted games, or given misinformation on a regular basis. Corey Jones, the so-called Sports Director, doesn't know what he is doing and he shouldn't be within 50 miles of ANY youth sports. He'll mess up your entire season and then offer up excuses and empty, long-winded apologies, when really he should be refunding money to unhappy parents. And good luck calling Corey's bosses - they don't care. I contacted Jim Grosso (Executive Director), Bryan Soper (Vice President of Operations for Valley of the Sun YMCA), and J. Bryan Madden (President / CEO of Valley of the Sun YMCA), but none of them called me back. What a great way to deal with unhappy players, coaches and parents - just ignore them! The only good thing about this YMCA is Rich at the front desk.",negative
Tried to call today to find pool hours for open swim and got 5 minutes of self promotion voice mail. Finally got to a live person that had no idea. Transferred to another who also had no idea what open swim is. Please answer the phone with someone who knows something about the YMCA,negative
"This is an outstanding facility with fantastic staff who are extremely accommodating. We held a corporate event here recently and were overwhelmed with their willingness to help us facilitate our function. The entire staff went above and beyond to work with us and assist in every way. I LOVED that they had racquetball courts - something I used to play many years ago and have struggled to find. It is a great indoor workout, especially when it is so hot during the AZ summers. Forget your expensive gym membership and join the Y. Laura Taylor is awesome and I am so appreciative of her help with our group. I can't wait to visit again!",positive
Shout out to Rich at the front desk! Were always happy to see him and all the other employees for that matter. This gym may not be the nicest or have the best equipment but it gets the job done and we've made great relationships and really feel apart of the community since joining back in March 2014. We've been long time members of different Y's across AZ and TX but there is definitely something special about this one! Giving 4 stars since they could use various equipment additions and improvements. All in all a great place and I recommend.,positive
Smells a little funky each time I come in but I think that's because the facility is an older one. I drop off the kid I babysit here for basketball and he seems to love the court. Someone always greets us cheerfully every time we come in and leave and that is a very inviting feeling. I haven't worked out here or used any of the things they have available but from what I've seen it looks great. The crowd is mixed age groups so I assume no one feels uncomfortable.,positive
"Gym = Okay Price = Okay Cancellation process = the most difficult, frustrating, irritating process I have been through with any gym. I processed the cancellation form with the gym, they did not cancel my membership. I called the gym, they did not cancel my membership. Life happens and a few months go by. I call the gym again. It takes them several days of digging to find my membership form, and they have not returned any of my money even after promising to and have also charged me additional amounts for the year renewal. Don't expect to be given more than the 3 months of your money returned (contractually obligated) either even though they've basically been stealing from you. I don't call that ""Christian"", but it seems like they don't take that word too seriously. You think you can trust the front desk person to hold up their end of the bargain....Nope, now they've dropped off the face of the earth. All in all, I advise you to go somewhere else if you ever want to change gyms or intend to move somewhere else. Pissed off in Mesa, Courtney I am actually writing this post in the hopes that they care about social media and will address these very obvious problems in their cancellation process.",negative
"This review is primarily directed at the strength training facilities at the Tempe YMCA. The location itself is nicely laid out with ample shaded parking, a plus in the summertime. Inside is large with segregated workout areas, a plus when cardio and group classes are being held. As an active weight lifter, my primary area of concern was the strength training room. It was small by my standards, with majority of the room being filled with cardio equipment. The dumbbell rack was standard, ranging from 10 to 100 pounds. There was only one bench though for bench press and incline, something I hoped would be more of since they are quite common exercises for any weight lifter. All the equipment was clean though, and the noise level was minimum, with no children on the floor. All in all, a standard weight training room with decent weights. I would not recommend this facility if your workout encompasses anything more than baseline free weights. For active duty military, this facility offers free guest passes, which is very nice.",negative
"Been a member since 2003, originally at Ahwatukee Foothills. As an athlete (post collegiate hammer thrower, OH YEAH!) I train at Crossfit 347. However, since I can only manage driving out there 3 days as week, it's convenient to have a membership for those days I'm done throwing in Mesa and need to get a workout in. Very friendly, unintimidating atmosphere. Someone always greets you. Ryan Aslan, one of the personal trainers is a pretty cool guy, and will stop by to catch up with everyone. Great for families and free childcare. They have locker rooms, but you need to bring your own lock. There's a nice variety of Group Fitness classes available. Favorites are Zumba class with Liz and Kimberly on Monday (5:30PM), Wednesday (4:30PM) and Saturday (8AM). Heidi also teaches a great Cycle class. Plenty of machines for all you cardio junkies out there! Oh, that weight room . . . True, this is a ""normal people"" gym so don't expect to see any bumper plates, quality barbells or platforms for the Olympic Lifts. No big, my coach has me modify or go lighter with higher reps. One squat rack always equals a wait. Like any typical gym, you'll see dudes doing CURLS on the squat rack and neglecting their legs. Too funny. Love that there's an auxiliary room for conditioning work. Thanks for having lots of jump ropes and KETTLE BELLS; how awesome is that?! Unlike other Valley YMCA locations, there seems to be less girl-on-girl cattiness. If it's happening I'm too busy working out to notice, but yeah. You won't even see Stepford Wives all decked out in Lulu Lemon, the entire MAC counter on their faces and NOT breaking a sweat here. Everyone's there to workout and get stuff done. Sure, I've had a couple douchebros make offensive comments within earshot about me being the only female lifting . . . and lifting HEAVY! Being feminine and strong aren't mutually exclusive events. Duh. ;) Recommended!",positive
"Kind of a dive for a gym. Very much outdated and cramped with low ceilings and a small workout space compared to most facilities. The gym is nice for what it is and the studios are as well. The staff is not very friendly, I am used to facilities that greet you as you come and go and I don't receive that here. Also there is rarely staff in the work out area which I don't find to be normal. The equipment is fine, but nothing special. It is very tight and cramped, low ceilings make it feel even smaller. Would not recommend to most people.",negative
We are not members. We visited this location on recommendation from a friend for the Parents Night Out program. I found the entire experience to be very disorganized. Making reservations on the phone took over 15 minutes and being put on hold several times. When we arrived the night of it was hard to locate where we were suppossed to go. When we found the correct location it was quite chaotic and disorganized. My kids did have a nice time and I am confident they were treated well. We won't be back though.,negative
"Cool, so this is the first YMCA I have ever been to, so i have nothing to compare it to. Although I really don't need to compare it, as it does everything I need it to do. It has GREAT equipment for working out. I mean state of the art. you can plug your ipod or USB drive into the equipment for music and fitness tracking! In addition, They have a children's center where you can drop off your kid while you work out, and the place is hardly EVER busy! The guy at the front counter (my wife told me his name but I cant remember) went out of his way for me the other day and it was really appreciated! It seems like everyone there is cheerful and happy to help you with everything you need. The people that frequent this facility are extremely courteous, and clean the machines when they get done. I'm not kidding! I watched them! You don't get that kind of attitude at the gym on the corner! Also, the classes are challenging and fun (I don't attend, but my wife does and she loves them!) This facility is really awesome, and for the price you can't beat it! Do yourself a favor and quit your overcrowded, overpriced gym and join the Y in Tempe!",positive
"This is an organization with principles, where no one is turned away for an inability to afford membership (which is determined on a sliding scale). A place to come to for a wide variety of classes - from yoga to swimming to senior sessions. Where kids are taken care of while you work out. A place that steroid-popping spandex freaks don't frequent as much. I didn't think the Y really offered all that much until I went. I thought it'd be a facility with a kiddie pool and one treadmill we all had to share on rotation and with 72-hr advance reservation. It's not. You won't find a swanky cafe for example, but they do offer massages. The equipment is kept very clean but it's probably not the uber-most top-of-the-line. You will find personal training options without the desperate sales pitch. There will also be more families and kids - which I like. Less of the psycho fitness addicts; more of the average Jane or Joe just trying to keep in shape. As far as this particular location is concerned, I think it suffices, although I prefer the Y in Mesa if you're on the East side. The Tempe one feels somewhat...warehousey? A little spread out. I like the coziness of the Mesa facility. And I love that I can frequent more than one, by the way. You can go to almost any YMCA with your membership (check website for details). I vaguely remember the 24 Hour Fitness jerk telling me (during a horrendous sales pitch - see review) that one had to pay more for such a privilege. Not the Y. They make your effort to be fit and active affordable, simple, and stress-free.",positive
I attended a class in their 1 year anniversary and it was amazing! Perfect combo of weights and strength training. I highly recommend and will definitely be back!,positive
"By far my favorite barre studio in the area! Love all the different class types, and the environment is really uplifting! Would highly recommend trying it out!",positive
"Went for a trial class when I was staying across the street on a business trip. The TBC class was very challenging, but I didn't feel weird about modifying because everyone went at their own pace and adjusted the intensity up or down as needed. Overall great experience, everyone was very friendly! I'll be back on my next trip to Madison!",positive
"Love the classes that they offer. Love that they're expanding their times. Love that most of the instructors seem to know me by name. All of the instructors are so energetic (but not in the weird/over the top/creepy way) and make great verbal adjustments. And their customer service is outstanding. If your looking for a welcoming place to get your fit on and be surrounded by really empowering people, look no further. Ps go for their intro month discount for new members to test it out if you're questioning the commitment of their auto pay.",positive
"This studio is absolutely amazing. I have been taking classes for over a month now and I'm loving all the different class formats. The Barre Code can definitely be considered a one stop shop/replacement for a gym membership. The different formats offer such versatility that I get cardio in one class (HIIT) and strength training in another (The Barre Code) and then a little bit of both in another (TBC). Another thing to rave about is the amazing instructors. They are all so nice and actually take the time to greet clients and ask how your day is. You don't always get that at gyms or other boutique studios. Kellian, the owner is one of the nicest people I have met. She truly cares about everyone that walks in the door and most days (when she's not teaching) you can see her taking other classes, which is so awesome. Overall the community at The Barre Code is second to none. The client base ranges from students to young professionals to active retirees (both men and women) which is so much fun! There are lots of modifications if you're unable to do certain moves and the instructors are so knowledgeable and are always walking around correcting technique and helping to push clients further. Lastly, I always end up sore after taking classes. The great thing about The Barre Code is the workouts change weekly and each instructor has different choreography so you're RARELY doing the same workout twice in a week. This keeps things interesting. The class goes by so quickly!! I would strongly suggest taking a class at The Barre Code and trying it out for yourself. I am so impressed with everything about this studio. You have to try it yourself.",positive
"I love The Barre Code! Kellian is an awesome instructor, she's always pushing you to work harder. Serena is also great at keeping you motivated and ensuring proper form The Barre Code class is changed regularly so you never get to comfortable but it is always a challenge!",positive
"I love this place and it's changing my life! Where do I start? I'm not the kind of girl that likes to work out and pushing myself in an athletic way hasn't been something I've done regularly... Maybe ever. I'm in my mid-thirties now and shit is getting real. I sit at a desk all day and feel pretty shitty physically most of the time, I have chronic pain issues and autoimmune stuff that leaves me feeling exhausted and like I should just crawl into bed and never leave, but this is finally something that works for me and things are really turning around! I feel amazing when I finish a workout there. If I could go everyday I honestly would. I love Kellian's classes because she is super motivating and pushes me harder than I ever thought I could go and I still want to come back. Also you work super hard and it's over in 50 minutes and you feel amazing when you're done. The workouts are always changing so you're always challenged. I'm working muscles I never knew I had and I'm seeing results so quickly it's kind of blowing my mind. I'm into it like I've never been before and I'm going to keep showing up and being proud of how much I can do. So happy I found this place!",positive
My wife and I started TruHit a few months ago and we are loving it. Scott and his team are awesome. The childcare makes it really convenient and my kids love going there. I would definitely recommend working out here.,positive
"My husband and I have gone to Truhit for over three years now, and we love it! Everyday is a completely different workout, and it keeps things interesting. Its also a fantastic workout! As someone who has worked out my entire life and I consider myself to be decently fit, it's a challenge! I really like the feeling of working out with a team, and that's what you get here. There's comradery and encouragement among all of the members! It's a very positive, judgement free workout space. Another huge positive is that there are a variety of fitness levels among the members, and you just tailor the workout to your level. I actually worked out the entire time I was pregnant and was able to modify throughout the pregnancy. The trainers are super knowledgeable, and really watch your form while you workout, which is critical. The owner, Scott, really practices what he preaches and lives a healthy lifestyle!",positive
"Addicted to these workouts. Best results I've ever had. Love the positive environment, community of friends I've made and being challenged daily. ""Those who stay will be champions"".",positive
"Scott and his team are fantastic. The whole place is geared to help you succeed, all you need to do is show up. Scott will walk you through how to eat, how to rest and how to get in better shape, all without judgment or guilt. While I haven't been able to go as much as I would like lately, I look forward to getting back into his gym ASAP.",positive
"I'm in my 2nd week here, and really love the workouts. If you're trying to lose weight, and want to avoid heavy lifting...then this is your perfect gym. Lots of functional movements with kettlebells, TRX straps, medicine balls, and other essential equipment. Definitely excited to see where this takes me.",positive
"I responded to a job ad as a health coach, as I went to school for nutrition, I figured this was a legit job in the nutrition industry. I showed up to what I realized was a gym, along with 15-20 other people to listen to an Herbalife sales pitch from the owner of the gym... Although everyone seemed very nice, I didn't appreciate being lured in through a job posting, thinking I was coming from an interview, to find out that all they are doing is trying to add Herbalife members to their team so that they can make money off of you. I tried one of the shakes, and it was pretty good, however, they expect you to replace whole meals with shakes... You are only losing weight because you are drinking low calorie protein shakes instead of eating real food.... I agreed to come back a second day to meet with someone one on one to see what it was really about. All he did was take all of my stats- weight, BMI, height etc... and then sell me an Herbalife package and distribution ID. $75 dollars later, I find myself giving money to the place that I thought would be paying me as an employee. They are ""training"" people and telling them that if they do what they say, you too will lose a bunch of weight and be able to sell Herbalife yourself after that and share your story, and become a ""health coach""... You have to go through and complete their whole program and allow them to train you and sell you Herbalife before you can even become a health coach. The best part about it? You have to figure out how to get clients all by yourself. They expect you to wear these dumb pins on your shirt that advertise Herbalife, and they expect that that will lure people into asking you about it and then you would have to sign them up. It's no different than selling Avon or Mary Kay. They want you to have parties at your house and try to get people to buy Herbalife. It's more about the product than the actual health coaching. It's ridiculous. These people have no credential in nutrition, no DTR, no RD, no MD, and some don't even have their personal training license... Not only is that not safe for the people that come into their gym expecting a qualified person to train them, it is unethical to work in the nutrition/health industry without a credential or degree in Nutrition/Dietetics. I feel bad posting this review because everyone that I met did seem very nice, but I just can't take it anymore watching all of these people go and get nutrition advice from people who have no legal credential or ethical right to be able to even call themselves ""health coaches"". You wanna be a health coach? Go earn a Bachelors and then get back to me.",negative
"I've been going to this gym for over a year now. This is the first gym that I have gone to and stuck with. I have always been a wonderer at gyms..wondering around from one piece of equipment to another without really knowing what I should be doing. I love that this place has everything set up for you when you go to class. It takes all of the guess work out of what I need to be doing. The sense of community within this organization is amazing. Everyone is nice, and genuinely happy to see you. There are people of all different fitness levels participating in the workouts so there is never any judgment. I would highly recommend them.. They also have daycare available at certain times.",positive
"I am absolutely in love with this gym! I signed up for the 30 day challenge and I'm on day 15 and could not be happier. They are so encouraging and always push you to be the best you can be. I really enjoy how there are people working at all levels. There are people who are just starting out and others who are extremely fit athletes. Regardless of your experience and fitness, everyone comes out being challenged and stronger. All of the coaches are so helpful and make sure you are doing the workouts properly and safely. Scott is extremely patient, engaging and truly cares about your success. I cannot wait to finish out the month and I hope to continue my fitness journey with TruHit!",positive
"I've worked out at plenty of gyms during my life. TruHit is by far the most enjoyable experience I've had at a gym. The workouts are challenging, but most importantly each trainer takes the time to get to know you personally. The other thing that makes them stand out is even if they meet you once, they will remember your name. Scott runs a fantastic operation, and if you stick to going to the same class you'll make some great friends. If you're looking for a gym that will bring challenging, ever-changing workouts that leave you gasping for air during and after, this is the place! Highly recommend.",positive
This is a good gym for people that are just getting started and have been out of fitness since the starting of club memberhsips. I dont feel the vibe and i dont like being feel pressured to buy worthless products like Herbalife. Nothings for free thats for sure.,negative
"It is close to work so I gave it a try and found it sucked do to the following reasons. 1. I found the facility sparse with almost no equipment I considered it substandard do to this. 2. The constant sales push of the overpriced supplements made me feel like I was at an Amway convention. 3. Every other gym I have been to was much better and had more equipment, friendlier and more competent staff, no constant sales push etc..",negative
"I completed the January challenge and it was great. A friend told me about it and there is location nearby my house so I decided to try it out. They do an initial evaluation: weight, body fat, muscle mass, measurements, push-ups, sit-ups and a mile run. You attend classes at least 3x/week, flexible for any schedule with classes 6 days a week and in the morning and afternoon. Each workout day focused on either upper body, lower body, or all body/cardio. Leg day was my fave. They change up the exercises so you never get bored, and use equipment like TRX, rowing machine, dumbbells, kettle bells, medicine balls, jump ropes, boxes, and your own body. Either you do a certain amount of each exercise or you do it for a specified period of time. Sometimes they do partner exercises. After a month, you come to evaluation day and they take all the stats again. I'm happy that I gained muscle, which was my goal. They give prizes to the top 3 finishers who lost the most weight, lost the most body fat percentage, and improved on their times for the cardio. Staff is friendly, welcoming and very helpful during the workouts. The trainers are supportive and make sure you're doing the exercises correctly. I recommend you do their challenge or do a trial to see if you like them. I really like this place but it's expensive for me to commit to right now. If you sign up for a meal plan, the monthly rate is reduced. You definitely get what you pay for, which is a quality workout and good results.",positive
"Super intense workout with lots of motivational support. I joined their 30 day free fitness challenge, and on my 3rd workout, I could no longer bend down to sit on the toilet or couch. Getting up out of bed or my chair was impossible. So yes, you will get a massive workout. The only thing I don't like, which is just personal preference, is that you have to partner up with others when doing activities. I prefer an environment where I can stick my head phones in and work out solo. But that's just me. If you don't want to make friends and want to do it on your own, this is not the program for you. If you want to workout until you fall over, this is the place for you!!!",positive
Holy cow. Upper body day. I had a hard time lifting my dork to eat my dinner. My arms r dead lol. Great class once again,positive
I signed up for a free week membership. Wanting to participate in Their weight loss nutrition counseling. I have called their office 3 times and the president once as well as a text and have left multiple vm's with the office. It's been 3 days since with no word from anyone. Their counselor was suppose to call me to schedule an Appt for the program. So far no call backs or texts despite multiple efforts I received a call from the owner of the gym. I've had to have unexpected surgery so I can't do anything physical for quite awhile. I was impressed he took the time to reach out. I would suggest giving them a try.,positive
"The workouts here are great, and for anyone. Everyone does the same thing but you can kind of go at your own pace and you are never racing against anyone. The people are very friendly and you will definitely notice a change after the first week. I workout regularly at many different high intensity classes, and my muscles have been sore after several of these classes! Get a living social or groupon or just try it for a week. That is how I tried it and I was hooked after a few classes.",positive
"This is by far the most success I have ever had with one gym. The trainer Tim Deloch is amazing! The workouts combine a hybrid of Crossfit & TRX training over a one hour period. Additionally, it a great positive group of individuals. Let's face it everyone has busy days and eating is something we think of last, and it affects our energy and lifestyle. This gym is really supportive as a group. Lots of fun people just trying to stay healthy! I like this gym because it covers, nutrition, fitness training and the support of attendees and trainers is out standing! Use referral code # 132068: for a free week OR try their 30 Day Fit Challenge. (That is how I got started.)",positive
"Amazing gym. The space and equipment is up to date, clean and well maintained. The trainers are truly passionate about their business. Boris the owner is friendly, positive and committed to his trainees. They also have the best sound system than any gym around you can work out to chest pounding music and 3 big TVs show the daily workout.",positive
This gym is a true workout for every level of ability. The instructors give assistance with correct form throughout the work out! Tori is my favorite instructor. It has a very friendly staff and you feel like part of a community working out there. Everyone is positive and encouraging!,positive
I attended my first class Monday with Adam for an upper body workout which went well. I wasn't sure what to expect because there are mixed reviews. This is a community of like minded individuals who want to see you succeed and do your best. I struggled with my form and Adam was there to guide and direct me in a very positive and supportive way another young lady who worked there helped me out as well. I most likely would have given up after 30 minutes but being with a group and trainer pushes you through the tough times. Friendly people in the class. Clean facilities. Also spin classes which are separate from a truhit membership and last but not least a nutrition bar with no pushy salespeople. Way to go to the whole crew at Truhit fitness in Scottsdale!,positive
"I am a full time mom of a newborn baby and I have one hour a day where I get to have time to myself. I came to Jenny's class (TRUHit Scottsdale/Platinum location) because I believed she could support me in my road to regaining my strength back. Not only did she attempt to discourage me, but it was also a form of bullying. She humiliated me, I felt extremely uncomfortable and upset. Mind you, this is my first time at this facility and Jenny has never met me before. It shocks me that as a head trainer/owner she would go out of her way to single me out, call me out, and ask me to leave the class if I am unable to perform a certain push-up due to my postnatal loss of strength. She harassed me and questioned whether or not I wanted to get strong and if I couldn't respect her class then I should leave. No trainer should ever make anyone feel this way. I will not be returning to this facility in the future. I just wanted to share my situation because it is unfair for it to happen to anyone else, let alone a mom who leaves her baby at 6 in the morning to try to be healthier for her newborn baby.",negative
"Canceling has been a nightmare and it appears it's still not resolved. My boyfriend was just offered a really great job in Atlanta. We decided it was worth moving out there so I told Scott at the TruHit on 79th Street, he said no problem I'll get your membership canceled. He said I needed to call this gym on McDonald to cancel my spin membership. I called this gym 1/23, 1/24, 1/25. 1/26, 1/27, 1/28 and left a voicemail. I finally got a response when I missed a call from them on 1/30. The message was from Hannah who promised that my membership would be canceled but she also told me to go online to fill out the cancellation, which I did immediately! 2/13 TruHit on McDonald pulls $40 from my account for spin. I call again 2/13, leave a message, 2/14 leave a message, again 2/14 am given one of the owners phone numbers, Jeremy, of course Jeremy doesn't answer or call me back. I call again 2/15 leave a message. Call again 2/15 am told one of the owners is there Jen and that she'll call me back. I try her again hours later and am being told she's really busy and is in and out. OK, WHAT ABOUT ME? WHAT ABOUT THE PAYING CUSTOMER THAT WAS LOYAL TO YOUR GYM UNTIL I FOUND OUT I HAVE TO MOVE STATES? I don't have a lot to do with packing up a house, selling it and working on the logistics of moving across the country. My time isn't valuable? I should have to drag this out until possibly after I've left AZ for good? This gym is acting like I'm leaving because I hate the gym. I've loved working out at TruHit and wished there was one in ATL. After this experience I would absolutely never return to this gym. I'm not sure why my $40 was worth all of this. Why would a gym do this?",negative
"I've been coming to TruHit for over a year and a half and love it. The workouts consistently challenge me and I have seen improvement in my form and the amount of weight I am able to lift. Great workout, music, energy, and people --definitely recommend it to athletes of all levels!",positive
"I had a very unpleasant experience my first time here. The set up is pretty typical for a boot camp-style class, with TRX, mats, and dumbbells. The instructor explained the moves in the circuit, not problem so far. One of the push up moves I was performing incorrectly. I like it when the instructor cares enough to correct my form, but I did have a problem with the instructor repeatedly telling me, ""everyone else here is doing the work, you're not doing the work."" I'm no slacker when working out, but I just felt berated and defensive. I mentioned that I had copied what my partner had done, to which I was told, ""I'm the instructor here ma'am."" Yikes! I have never walked out of a workout before. I left a message to speak with the owner/manager, but I did not get a return call.",negative
"I've been coming to TruHit a few times a week for the past 2.5 months and I am addicted. The trainers are great, and I've met a lot of really cool people in the classes. It's an added bonus to see familiar faces every time I walk in the room. One of my favorite things about this place is that the classes are filled with beginners all the way to super buff athletes but I never feel intimidated. Everyone is SO friendly and helpful. The exercises are ones that I wouldn't typically think to do on my own or even know how to do on my own but they are results-driven. I've definitely gained some muscle mass, lost some weight and am able to lift more weight than I ever have in the past If I could describe this gym in three words, they would be unpretentious, encouraging & challenging. Note: No one has ever pushed the Herbalife products on me. I became obsessed with the protein shakes all on my own after trying the Oatmeal Cookie and Chocolate Mint shakes at TruHit. )",positive
"Huge space, and the staff is very friendly. The shakes and teas are delicious as well. My overall favorite part is the motivation goal white board. I love reading what others are working towards and how they hold them selves accountable. I look forward to Cross Fit Friday and Spin Saturday!",positive
BEST PLACE FOR SPINNING. Tuesday at 5:30 with Jessica is my favorite part of my day. It's totally affordable and the staff is so nice. I take everyone who is interested in cycling here. Don't hesitate. It's totally worth it.,positive
I wish there was a gym like TruHit near me in Atlanta. The staff and the classes there are amazing. The spin class with Lindzi Everett was awesome and super motivating. I also tried a Fit BootCamp class and it was challenging but encouraging. The whole group was welcoming. Everyone worked hard and it was very motivating. I'm so thankful I had the opportunity to go to TruHit and will return when I come back to Arizona!,positive
"I have gone to many Gyms, and this Gym is truly unique! Every member is supportive and you truly get a well rounded work out all week! Also, the workouts are 100% different everyday! I never get bored!",positive
"I love this gym!! I started the 30 Day Challenge in July 2015. I've lost 30 pounds and my body shape has changed as well. I'm so much stronger than I was. I have more energy and stamina. Both the staff and the members are friendly and helpful. The workouts are always different, never boring and can be modified if you have preexisting injuries.",positive
"5 stars isn't enough to rate this, I'd give it 10 stars if I could. This place has changed my life and has gotten me into a healthier lifestyle. I had a lower back surgery, a disc replacement and disc fusion at my L5-S1, in February 2015. For years, I haven't been able to do much exercise due to my back problems, my health and my strength wasn't there anymore. Enough was enough, I decided that when I started feeling able, that I needed a change. That's when I was introduced to TruHit. The trainers made me instantly feel comfortable and I knew I had their support from the minute I stepped in. Even in classes of 20 or more, the trainer leading in each class always kept an eye on me and my form to ensure I didn't cause any more injury to my back and kept me positive when I was struggling. I started at 20% body fat and struggled mightily through the work outs, but with the support I received I dropped to 12% in just a few months and handling the workouts with more ease. I got an ego boost and my confidence has come back. Everyone here, from staff to members, become family and provide you with a community that can't be matched anywhere else. This gym has become my second home and wouldn't have it any other way. You won't regret stepping your foot into the doors here.",positive
"Tried this gym only because classes were cheap. The girl who taught the morning class, (Can't remember her name, she was in okay shape... Jamie?Jenny?), screamed at everyone for talking during warm up. Not quite my cup of tea. The workouts are very similar to my usual gym, Bodi, however Bodi has a much more positive/comfortable/fun vibe. Depends what you're going for..",negative
I did the free 30day challenge in September 2015 and loved it! I didn't feel pressured to sign up or to do anything. I loved the support from the trainers especially Jen. She is always available when I have questions or in need of nutrition advice. I would definitely recommend this gym to anyone and to at least try the 30 day challenge.,positive
THIS PLACE WILL CHANGE YOUR LIFE!!! I have tried MANY gyms in the valley and NOTHING compares to TruHit Platinum!!! It is a family community and a one stop shop for ALL of your fitness goals!!! Do yourself a favor and check out the FREE 30 day trial! It's seriously free for 30 days! I thought the same thing! What is the catch? There is NO CATCH! I knew I couldn't leave after a week of doing the training! It is like no other gym!,positive
"Love the workouts. Always challenging and fun. Great people, great atmosphere. It feels like a big family working out together.",positive
"I don't usually leave YELP reviews, but Truhit Platinum/Central Scottsdale really deserves it. This place changed my life! I first joined them during a 30-day FREE Fitness Challenge and they gave me so much more than fun workouts. They helped me get in the best shape I've ever been; they helped me believe I was stronger than I thought; they supported me in ways no other gym has; and ultimately, they helped me lose (and keep it off) 60+lbs. They've never pressured me into anything and never tried to sell something I wasn't interested in buying. They simply support my goals and help me stay motivated. I love this place - the people and workouts are the best. I highly recommend it to anyone who want to challenge themselves into being in the best shape of their lives and become the best version of themselves.",positive
I love this place! The workouts are fun and my body has changed so much. It's affordable and total worth the free 30 day challenges they have every other month,positive
This gym is amazing and gets you the results your looking for!! The workouts are fun and there is always a great group of friends to workout with!!,positive
This is an absolutely awesome gym to go to the workouts are intense yet it keeps you wanting to come back every day the people here are purely amazing they have been a major part and very important to my life,positive
"Amazing coaches and accountability partners promoting healthy active lifestyle, nutrition, HIIT, and now Spin Cycling!! Best Place Ever - you MUST stop in for free class and shake",positive
"This is the best gym I've ever been to hands down. You come here you're getting results. All the staff is super friendly. It's a fun atmosphere to be in. Group classes that really push you to your limits. The members all support each other, and hangout and socialize after the workout... Its awesome! I've never been to a gym where the owners and trainers will be taking the class right along side you sweating it out themselves. Top notch gym! I recommend giving it a try",positive
"I have lived in AZ for years and been to many different gyms/programs as I like to stay fit. I checked this place out after given a free one week pass when they opened near me inside an old auto parts store. It is MOSTLY an empty room with a rubber mat and about 5 rowing machines and a couple bar stools to sit in while they try to up sell supplements.. They have very little to offer- almost no equipment, rude staff, heavily pushed over priced supplements etc... I found the staff was both very rude and aggressive. I was offered no assessment, almost no equipment to use -just a class to do calisthenics with a few others while watching some rude so called instructor rant about while trying to push the VERY overpriced supplements. In one class the woman was so aggressive I suspected steroid use. I couldn't prove it but the behavior was in my opinion indicative of it. Whats also stunning is even the almost free CLUB SAR Gym Scottsdale offers just two minutes away for 20 dollars a month or 99 dollars a year (Scottsdale residents) is 1000 times what this facility is. It has 1000 times more equipment, more and better staff, more fitness programs, larger, nicer etc etc... Every gym I have ever been a member of puts this place to shame in all aspects. In summary my recommendation would be to go almost anywhere else! Or if this is what you want just by any tape from a late night infomercial. I expect this place wont stay open long. P.S My understanding is employees ""from all locations"" are required to post 5 star yelp reviews thus deceiving the public into thinking this place has something to offer.",negative
"Workouts are amazing, people are awesome, and trainer is hot!!!!! They have a great post workout nutrition shop inside as well. They also have amazing promotions to try the gym out for cheap!",positive
"Great gym with a friendly, skilled and fun staff and coaches. I've be doing martial arts and boxing for 20 years and enjoy working out here as there's always a way to keep improving. Classes are a fun and great workout for any level fitness. There's a good mix of experienced and real fighters, mid-level and beginners here for a variety of training options. Brandon, Val and Ryan's classes are awesome! No attitudes and a welcoming vibe. Check it out and have fun!",positive
I joined about 3 weeks ago! This place is AWESOME! They Truly care about there members. I was skeptical about joining only due to the fact that I didn't want the employees to change the way they were when I signed up to everyday when I came in. BRANDON! Is AWESOME! I am so thankful I found a gym with him in it! If it weren't for him I wouldn't go there! Within my first two weeks I lost 4 pounds. I am going to be doing personal training with him and again he is absolutely awesome. Truly cares about what YOU want to accomplish and doesn't have that rude cocky attitude. Such a down to earth hard working guy! SO happy! And not to mention Robert the owner! He is so kind and has been ever since I started! Big plus plus is there is a shower and lockers. Love you guys and so happy to have found this amazing gym!!!!!!,positive
"I was 205lbs at 5'9"" when I joined and was extremely out of shape. The coaches and classes here helped me lose 30lbs in just 5 months! The classes are really fun and helpful with technique(something I was lacking) and motivation to push yourself to your limits. The coaches and staff are very very nice and were more than willing to help with everything I asked about. It is a really good way to get all your aggression out and be healthy at the same time! I love the gym and the UFC",positive
I recently signed my kids up here and they absolutely love it. The trainers are extremely patient and clearly passionate about what they do. They encourage and compliment the kids and also correct them when needed. Very clean and well kept. Much more inviting and friendly then other gyms I've been to! Pricing is more than fair. Highly recommend!,positive
"This is a great gym. The staff is friendly and knowledgeable. There is a good variety of classes and plenty of equipment to do your own thing. And unlike a lot of other gyms, there's the opportunity to spar with another member. I love this place!",positive
"I join this amazin sport center 2 months ago, i ve never done martial arts before, first of all management and coaches are very hand and they have great knowledge on their work with passion, They are not having you kick the bags an hour long they teach you what they know and philosophy behind it. Now i have different point of view on martial arts just because or UFC GYMs positive impact Thanks to Adrian and his fellow co workers and all my coaches You guys doing amazing job",positive
"I've had a positive experience from the start. All the staff members are easy going and very welcoming. The idea of walking into a fight gym can be very intimidating. The classes can be aimed towards anyone that's new to fitness/fighting and those wanting to train harder. I'm never bored in the classes and the coaches pay attention to each individual, providing as much guidance as possible. They've helped my husband and I fit in and learn the basics of each class and from there on how to make it more intense at our own pace. It's good to see that the gym has gained popularity and filled with great many people but it does limit the space available during some classes, which can feel overwhelming/crowded. I like that they host events throughout the month such as self defense classes, an anti bullying class, UFC showing parties, and classes that allow you to invite your friends and family for free. (A casual gym-goer)",positive
"Time for an update...after 1 month. OK, I've lost about 5 pounds and gotten into noticeably better shape, even though I've always been pretty dedicated to fitness. I love this gym. 1. The front desk staff knows me by name and cheerfully greets me whenever I walk thru the door (unheard of). 2. Classes are varied, well attended, and awesome...and ALL included in my membership. 3. Instructors are amazing...Charlie Swanton and Thiago Ximenez make this my favorite place to be. Thanks for making this my home away from home, family friendly, best gym ever.",positive
This is a great gym. I am a member in San Diego and this gym has equipment that SD does not have. I only go on Monday's and the instructors are great.,positive
I was a member of LA boxing before bought out by UFC gym. This new gym is under new ownership and management and I am blown away by this place. The class coaches are extremely knowledgeable and give the right amount of encouragement. The other gym members are approachable and helpful much like you would find at a crossfit type gyms. The equipment you can see is all top of the line state of the art stuff along with their free weights. The MMA classes fit anyone's schedule. What I really love about this gym is each class is unique and different so you will never have that repetitive feeling. I would highly recommend this gym to anyone.,positive
"State of the art weight equipment. The staff is great and highly knowledgeable, I've been to gyms all over and won't go anywhere else now, the price is reasonable and the staff can work with you on certain things.",positive
The facility is awesome with up to date and new versions of equipment. The owner and staff are always up beat and positive. The trainers are highly qualified to train and get you into the shape you are looking for.,positive
"I first started with the 21 day challenge, initially I was just looking for a few ways to spice up my work outs and put some pep in my step. I was impressed with the thorough consultation and Richelle's analysis of my needs and limitations. I am not a person that is in amazing shape, but I never feel like I can't do the work outs. She modifies them to your needs. The classes themselves are interesting and challenging. I especially love the camaraderie with the other campers. Its a lovely gaggle of women and feels very empowering. I would definitely recommend trying out the Ultimate Body Bootcamp. You, your body and your health will be thankful for it.",positive
"Ultimate Body Bootcamp is the best work out. Its never the same workout. Richelle is available with nutrition help. I started with a groupon and have now been a member for a little over a year. Richelle takes the time to meet with each member to come up with attainable goals and measures progress monthly. The other members are great, I was nervous at first but felt welcomed and felt comfortable with the other bootcampers.",positive
This has been the one workout that gives me enough variety and support to show-up! Two plus years and going strong! You won't be sorry for trying UBBC and you'll be even more happy with your results.,positive
"Ultimate Body Bootcamp is the only thing that has ever worked for me as far as a workout routine. I am not a typical ""gym"" person. I got a Groupon way back in 2010 and only thought I would do the month. I wound up signing up for much more. At the time I was recovering from a back injury and it was the only thing that helped me get stronger. After awhile I took some time off to have a child and didn't go back to UBBC until January 2013. At that time, I was so weak because I had been on bed rest with my pregnancy and had gained a bunch of weight. I never thought I would get back into shape. I was truly scared. I saw a post on Facebook for a UBBC challenge, emailed Richelle, the owner/trainer to tell her about my fear and how I had gained so much and my muscles had become so weak from my pregnancy. She eased my fears and said she would work with me. I wound up losing. 20 lbs of baby weight in just 3 months. I noticed I got stronger and my back felt better than it had since the 2011, the last time I was in bootcamp. The thing that I like best about UBBC is the camaraderie and the one on one assistance and attention. The owner, Richelle posts nutrition articles, recipes, etc. on the Facebook page, and really wants people to succeed. It is a fun atmosphere and people cheer each other on. The strength training Richelle teaches is awesome. I totally notice a difference in how I carry myself as a result. I have taken a couple months off to start a business, and I can tell my back has been bothering me again because I haven't been in bootcamp. I need to get back because it is the only thing that has worked for me, even after 1000s of dollars in chiropractic and massage therapies. This is a great local business that supports other local businesses. There are always posts on the UBBC website/FB page about giving to charities and helping out causes. Do not feel intimidated to try this out. Richelle works with people of all levels and there is no embarrassment. I also love the variety of people and ages in the camps.",positive
"I originally signed up for Ultimate Body Bootcamp in April 2011. After 3-4 months I stopped going because it was hard for me to make it after work and I was ""sure"" there were more convenient options out there. Basically...I had plenty of excuses. Fast forward to February 2013, I had: joined and quit a gym, tired Bikram Yoga at every studio in the Valley, taken kickboxing and TRX classes and spent countless hours doing cardio in my apartment complex's gym. I realized that I hadn't found anything better and that I'm just not someone that can keep themselves motivated on my own. So I gave in and began taking classes at Ultimate Body Bootcamp again the following month. What really keeps me coming back is the fact that I haven't reached a plateau. It's a killer workout and isn't repetitive because each class is different than the last. The class environment is fun, friendly and challenging. Richelle (the owner) is fantastic and encourages you to push yourself and really make each workout count. She is a wealth of knowledge about both fitness and nutrition. I've been taking classes at Ultimate Body Bootcamp for nine straight months now and can say that I'm still just as sore after each class as I was the first week. I've made tremendous progress and am stronger than I've probably ever been. I can even say that I recently made the plunge into commitment and signed up for a full year of classes.",positive
"I found Ultimate Body Boot Camp through Groupon - I thought it was a great deal. I chose the Windgate Crossing location, and it is definitely a challenging workout! What I love the most is that Ray gives a challenging workout, pushes you to do the best you can, but isn't obnoxious or in your face like the other boot camp I went to in North Phoenix. He's tough in a way that is motivating, not discouraging. I also love how Richelle, the owner, is so smart about nutrition. I have tried diet after diet over the years, talked to nutritionists, etc. and I learned more from Richelle about how eating affects your body than I did from anyone else.",positive
"This review is written by a former skeptic--thinking Boot Camp would consist of aerobic dancing and yoga. . . I was mistaken. The Ultimate Body Boot Camp (UBBC) is an intense, fast paced full body workout that is often grueling. It rivals 2 a day football practices, condensed into an hour. Within 4 weeks, I saw dramatic improvements in both cardiovascular endurance and strength, and quickly lost weight. It is never boring, and Richelle is great and highly amusing. The one nit--6:30 a.m. or 7 p.m. classes por favor! I recommend!",positive
"My first experience with Ultimate Body Bootcamp (UBBC) was through a Groupon I purchased in spring 2010 - I paid $19 (I had a $10 credit) for a month of bootcamp classes. Although working out at 5:30am was not my idea of fun, the location was super convenient and I really came to enjoy it. Each day was similar in nature, but featured different activities so I never got bored or knew what was coming. Dr. Mary King and Jen were great instructors - friendly, knowledgeable, and positive. Near the end of my month of classes, they merely suggested signing up for the next month - no guilt trips or pressure to pay for another month or more. And the greatest part was that UBBC offered a great promo price for those who wanted to keep going, so I purchased another month! Groupon just offered another UBBC deal and I'm signed up to go again in April! If you missed these deals, keep your eyes open for UBBC (and other bootcamp) deals on the ""deal"" sites!",positive
"Ultimate Body Bootcamp provides incredible workouts, support and fun! Working out with a group of people helps me stay motivated. I also like all of the additional ways to get involved in an active lifestyle - newsletters with good nutrition info, short or long races, hikes, charity bootcamp, and more. Camps are Valley wide. Check out the 2010 Best of the Valley winner - your body will ultimately thank you for it!",positive
"Great place to get fit and learn some self defense! The people range from beginners to world class kickboxers. So whether you've done martial arts before or not, they do a great job making you feel welcome. I highly recommend Ultimate for those looking for something different from a typical gym",positive
"A good casual atmosphere and a great work out. I've been going here for a month now and my technique is looking better and better with every visit. I would recommend going when Derek is training if you are a beginner, hes one of the more forgiving trainers. If you are looking to get your but kicked buy your workout, then I would suggest Mani, my abs took a good three days to recover.",positive
"Went here to try out Muay Thai for the first time; I attended the women's only class. Great instructor (Joey). Very helpful at pointing out ways to improve my technique. Although I'm a beginner, it's better to have good technique from the beginning so I don't get bad habits, lol. One issue, though, is that the class was quite full so it was hard to get help/attention sometimes when I needed it; luckily I was paired with a more advanced student who was able to offer me tips. Lots of classes available at various times throughout the day, but it's probably good to call in advance since classes are sometimes cancelled without notice. Front desk staff was nice and helpful too. I thought it was a fun experience and I'd probably try it again, but note that for complete beginners (which I kinda am, but kinda am not, since I've done something similar before) it can be a bit tricky if you don't know the names of the moves or whatever. So it would be good to pair with a more advanced student or, if the class is not too busy, get help directly from the instructor.",negative
"Great atmosphere and great fun. I've been going to the location in North York and I love how supportive everyone is, how dedicated the instructors are to making sure you're doing it right, and the crazy kickass workout that you go through before and after practice. I'm totally pushed to my limit in every single class. This is my first time taking Muay Thai, but I've been doing martial arts on and off all my life. I like that people here are actually serious about technique. Seeing other people excel goes a long way in keeping me focused. I'm a few weeks in at roughly 2-3 classes a week, and even though my body hates me right now, I love it!",positive
Great atmosphere and friendly + helpful staff! I've never tried Muay Thai before and the instructors took the time to get me on track. I was surprised of how great of a cardio / strength workout it was compared to when I was working out at Goodlife.,positive
"Don't buy the Team Buy $20 for 20 Classes! I bought it once and after i tried 2 classes the instructor from SCARBOROUH site told me and my friend that we had to sign a contract to pay approx. $30 a month else we cannot continue to go to classes. Also he said we need to do all the classes WITH IN 2 MONTHS! The EXPIRY DATE written on Team Buy was in Sept 2012/13. This contract was not written on TEAM BUY. The man told us that this was not his problem and told us to get a refund from Team Buy. This is place is called ""ULTIMATE MARTIAL ARTS"". Please comment if you have experienced a similar situation. Thanks.",negative
"There was a deal going on awhile back on one of the coupon websites, so I bought a $30 for 30 classes card. A friend of mine who is already a member at UMA finally got me to get off my couch and redeem my voucher... Located in an industrial strip of Scarborough and not having a very visible sign, I overshot the place, and had to do a u-turn. When I pulled up to the studio, the windows were all steamed up... Was I at a hot yoga studio? The place is very casual. Its basically a reception desk, with one big open room that has a punching bag, a boxing ring, and a huge matted area for the kickboxing and muy thai classes. I attended the 8:30PM class tonight, which was slightly less crowded than the 7:30PM class. The class ran for an hour. In terms of instruction, I think that this would be a very intimidating experience for a newbie. The class was male-dominated, and most of the guys had been members for some time, so I'm glad that I came with a friend who would tolerate my not-so-suave moves. Think, intimidating is to guy who goes to a hot yoga class... this was infinitely worse! The class starts off with a warm-up series consisting of jogging on the spot, high knees, back kicks, jumping jacks, and lunges. You repeat this twice. You then transition into jabs, cross punches and hooks. After this phase is over, you grab a partner. You will do a series of cross punches, hooks, and switch kicks. The kicks were the hardest part for me, as for some reason my toes didn't want to pivot. I got quite frustrated, but was lucky that my partner was very patient with me. I could see how someone could be discouraged from ever coming back again with the lack of instruction and care given by the staff. However, I did break a good sweat, and the hour flew by really fast. I would definitely take one of these classes over a long and boring one hour jog that probably burns a lot less calories!",negative
"If I could give them no stars I would. Todd is the most arrogant person I have met. He does not return calls when he says he will. I called on a refund of $200. When I called and had to give my name he happened to be busy. When I called back and used a fake name he was amazingly available. Mike Kikes the owner is not any better. I guess $200 is worth more to him than a bad review on this site and our HOA site that reached over 11,900 people that lives in his back yard. I had to post on Mike's personal and company FaceBook, and had to send an email on their company website to call me. He finally called me back. Then he had to review my file and was going to call me back. Mike did not, I had to call him back. At least I did not have to use a fake name this time. They have the worst customer service. There is a new gym going in on Reems and Bell. Much cheaper and what I hear better customer service. I will never go back to this gym nor will I recommend them. They are not a company of integrity or honesty.",negative
"This gym is solid. It has a decent repetoire of machines and free weights. Even when the place is busy, you can still find things to do. I don't have much experience with the staff but the other patrons of this establishment are usually polite. The layout of the gym is pretty good and it is fairly clean. The bathrooms and daycare are on the far right of the gym. Next to it are the free weights amd some bicep machines. There are 3 adjustable benches for bench press. The have a few different leg machines and a Smith machine. In the center of the gym, there is a power cage for all your powerlifting needs in there is where you will find metal weights. There are a few cable cross over machines next to a few hammer machines. For you who like treadmills and stairstepper, they have those. The gym also has two other rooms which usually house classes ofnsome sort. I am not sure of those since I do my own thing. Overall, I am very happy with my neighborhood gym. The fees are low. The parking lot is huge. The gym has everything I need. The only suggestions for The gym would be to change out a few benches.",positive
"I was so happy to have a gym right around the corner from my house. I was so pumped to check this place out. There was two men at the front desk that were absolutely garbage. They were incredibly rude. I was interested in purchasing a membership so they had me wait in the ""lobby"" but they wouldn't even let me use their restroom unless I was an official member. I would rather lose my weight on a treadmill than be here.",negative
"Great gym. They offer classes and are currently expanding this location which is awesome. They are family owned and the owners are always there and available if you have and questions, comments, concerns, and even advise! Also there is a wide range of different people so no need to feel like this gym won't accept you, everyone starts somewhere.",positive
This gym is so amazing! The staff is so friendly and the gym is so clean! I love that the machines are always accessible and that I don't feel that I'm at a dating club when I am working out. The crowd there is there to work out and not there to sit around a socialize. The kids care is amazing and that is a huge deal to me because it's hard to find people I trust to watch my son. I love working out knowing that he is well taken care of. The owners of the gym truly know what they are doing and are so friendly. I live in Peoria and everytime I am out in surprise I stop by and work out here. I wish I lived closer I would come here all the time. This is saying a lot because working out for me has always been a chore. Keep up the good work WTF!,positive
"I don't even know where to start. They always have a smile, and take time to get to know you. Zach is more than helpful with the machines, he never seems put out by little requests. And Anne is always a pleasure to talk to. My kids love going to the child care area. One thing I was worried about was that because it is a smaller gym the machines would be older, totally not the case. I have never seen any of them broken. The gym is very clean and well maintained. If you are considering joining a gym in the West Valley to me there is no other option! Friendly staff, nice machines, child care, and CLEAN!",positive
"Hi my name is Ricardo Vasquez and I created the yelp page for ""westside total Fitness "" .I am a members who is interested in putting a review.I am not paid and enjoy using Yelp for honest reviews..I encourage other members to be honest about it.I gave it 5 stars because they deserved it.I believe this business should be allowed for recognition to any new potential members coming in.Staff always friendly and welcoming you in.This gym is really nice,clean, sanitize and everything is wipe down.The air conditioning nice plus they have fans on the ceilings.The lighting is great and peaceful.Just visit and one of the staff with be glad to give you a tour.Nothing but weight to loose and a healthy lifestyle to gain.Those of you looking to replace an existing gym, just might replace your gym and choose (WTF) like I did.Thanks "" Westside total fitness"" for opening this gym as my motor vehicle spine injury required me to do gym daily for the rest of my life.",positive
"All the equipment is in need of repair. Most machines have rips in their cloth or leather, along with Pins missing that allow you to set the weight. The contract also apparently has an substantial early termination fee, that is hidden quite well. I cannot recommend this gym to anyone.",negative
This gym is a complete joke! The Wifi has been down since the new owner took over 6 months ago. I doubt it will ever be back up! The AC is more than likely broken because on some days it's hotter in there than it is outside. The biggest problem is that on Sundays it does not open until 12 PM! The equipment is old. Broken equipment is not repaired or replaced its just removed from the facility. The daycare hours are inconsistent. Sign up at your own risk.,negative
Awesome gym with HUGE renovations and improvements being done. Management is fantastic and is very interpersonal. The people here are warm and welcoming; the perfect gym for me and my wife.,positive
"This place has a new owner this year. As of July 15th 2017 there is NO AC. It's gotta be around 90 degrees inside there in the afternoon. It is very very HOTT! About 10% of the weights have been stolen. Hopefully you don't need any 20lb dumbells or 40 lbs fixed barbells because they haven't been there for 3 or 4 months. The drinking fountain has been warm for a year. There used to be about 8 squat racks, now there is ONLY 1! and the gym is huge. There is no chair sit on when using dumbells. All of the material on all of the benches are torn and ripped to shreds. The floor is bowing up in the middle of the gym and i trip on it all the time. The new owner said that he will not put a dime into the gym until people start respecting it. He has been there 6 months and It's going downhill FAST. It used to be an amazing huge gym with so much equipment. Now it's all broken, stolen and unkept. The gym opens at 12 pm on sundays so hopefully you don't like to workout in the morning on weekends. Members are dropping like flies. This gym is next to my house and used to be 24 hours. Now that the hours are limited and the gym is going downhill so fast I think I need to change gyms. Really disappointing as this was my favorite gym in the area and I've been to a lot of gyms",negative
"This place is a law suit waiting to happen, if the patrons could ever afford a lawyer. Knowing how many lawyers exist in Cleveland and Ohio generally, this place is a sitting duck.",negative
"I find yoga to be very relaxing but challenging at the same time! Yoga to the People did not disappoint from the moment I walked in the teacher was welcoming and studio looked inviting! I found spot and unrolled my mat, I arrived 15 ahead so I had plenty of time to find my spot! The studio is one big open room with two restrooms inside. The studio is donation base with suggestion of 10 bucks but no intention of turning you away if you do not have it this time. They invite you pay at end of class and come in to enjoy the practice first. I simply left my cash in basket on my way out. I love this system. The yoga practice was slow moving then gradually worked up to fast pace flow. I was sweating by end of class, don't forget to bring a towel if you need it. I also received hands on adjust which was nice for beginner such as myself. I have lived in Tempe for almost two years now and just found this gem.. I will be back! Tip.. The parking garage next door give 1 Hour free parking and 1.50 after the first hour prior to 8pm I believe. Check the studio website",positive
"I was staying nearby for business in the Residence Inn, and decided to check this studio out. The instructor was lovely, there was no chanting, and the studio was clean with plenty of room. Really positive experience.",positive
"This place is special. I've been doing yoga over 20 yrs and never cried at the end of my practice before. I love the way they allow you to just be. I like the diversity of people... it's not super yuppie and I like that. It embraces the true spirit and allows you to reach a meditative state easily. Wish they had mediation only classes as I would like to bring friends who are afraid for one reason or another of the ""stretching"" poses.",positive
"This studio is my life saver. After numerous illnesses that left me quite out of shape as well as in a very low tax bracket I was looking into feeling well and strong again. I felt defeated after checking into classes at other studios and realizing I wouldn't be able to afford restarting my yoga practice. That is until I found yttp! I love the classes and instructors and they make it clear they don't expect you to pay any more than you can afford. Thank you, thank you, thank you!",positive
"This is a nice studio. A little hard to hear the instructor sometimes. Also, the instructor barked at me to take my shoes off as I entered, which didn't exactly set the yoga vibe. I would return and take it with someone else! Also, if you go to a late class, get your parking validated!",positive
This Yoga studio is my new favorite! The instructors are very nice and accommodating to all types of people. If you haven't done yoga before they are very good at helping and showing how to modify the poses. They have free may storage as well if you want to leave your mat there. The parking garage is very convenient. I usually go on weekends or in the evening so parking is free.,positive
Love the donation-based model of this studio. Dropped in while in AZ for work. Class was challenging but also suitable for beginners. Highly recommend!,positive
"I've been to this yoga studio twice and it's really comfortable. The class is challenging and you will leave drenched in sweat but it's nothing a beginner couldn't do. I, myself, am a beginner. They recognize that not everyone has been practicing for years so you are encouraged to make modifications to suit your body's abilities. You never feel like you need to go past your limits. I plan to visit one of the candle lit classes on Sunday nights. The music they place isn't the most soothing music but I tend to block it out and focus on the instructors voice. Lastly, it's quite nice that they are donation based. I'm a grad student so you can imagine, I don't have a whole lot of spare money to spend on luxuries like are packages at yoga studios.",positive
"I've had constant back problems and I wanted to try yoga classes. I've taken a few before through rec centers and MCC, etc. But being a starving artist and single mom, all the studios I looked at were extremely expensive and I found this so disappointing. I had no idea about YTTP until i found it through a meetup group. I've been going there regularly now and I give as much as I can when I go. My back problems have improved and I am so thankful for this studio. I recommend it to everyone. Only thing i wish they would have a little more variation of poses. Its usually close to the same routine every time. This leaves me wanting to seek out other studios for more advanced moves. (if i can ever afford them). In the meantime, i'll keep coming here because Yoga should belong to everyone! Thank you YTTP!",positive
"Since I've only been to 2 or 3 yoga classes ever, I would not call myself a yoga enthusiast. But this place was great and I will certainly be back.",positive
"This place is awesome! When I got to Phoenix for my summer internship I was a little stunned at how expensive drop-in yoga classes are in comparison to my studio in Tucson ($5 Yoga Oasis :) ) but this place is only a tad more expensive than my usual 5 spot ($10 per class suggested) - and I've gotten my money's worth every time! The teachers are great and the classes are TOUGH! Also, if you are worried about parking on ASU campus, the parking structure right next to the studio is free after 6PM!",positive
"I love Yoga To the People! I've lived in Tempe for 6 years now, have tried so many yoga studios and really never found one that I liked-- until YTTP came! The best thing about it is that it's donation-based yoga, so you give what you can (recommended $10 a class) but you always feel welcome and never judged, no matter how much (or little) you put in the donation box. The instructors are great and make you feel comfortable right away, even if it's your first yoga class ever. They work with you improve your poses, but also give you enough space to explore and enjoy your practice on your own. I've been going to CJ's class recently and she's amazing! I can already feel the difference in my poses from the adjustments and pointers that she has given. The classes are flow classes and the instructors always give pose suggestions if you want to push yourself further, so you are able to get as hard of a workout as you want. If you haven't already, definitely give YTTP a try, you seriously won't regret it.",positive
"A little yoga gem right in the heart of college town. I've done yoga at a number of places & I'm used to expecting to ""get what you pay for"" so my expectations for my first donation based class weren't exactly high, but this place left me pleasantly surprised. It's perfectly clean, the ambiance is serene (esp during evening candlelit class), the staff is very personable, & of course, the yoga is awesome. I know it's a good class when my glasses fog up, which was achieved in every class I've taken with Cindy & James. I've brought friends with me with all different yoga experience (even first timers) & they all loved it too. It's definitely a place worth trying & spreading the word about.",positive
"Yoga to the People is a GREAT studio. I moved here recently from the Northeast and was looking for a studio that matched the intensity and tranquility that I had in my studio in Boston. YttP is all of that and more! Cindy is a wonderful teacher and always gives a good mixture of flow, challenge, sweat and sweet peaceful shavasana at the end. The other rotating teachers all offer their own perspective and relationship to the practice. Sunday candlelight flow classes and usually the most popular and why not? It is a perfect way to round out your weekend. You won't be disappointed.",positive
"Had been riding my bike past this place multiple times thinking, ""yoga studio = $$$$"" but to my delight (and prob yours) it's the exact opposite. I've done yoga across the valley (amateur yoga student for sure) but this was the hands down, absolute best yoga class I've been to. Cindy is great and and whether it's a huge, filled class or a small post-work class of just 5 she makes sure you're doing the positions accurate and at your level. I think it's great for the community, for your mind and for your body. I know I sound super granola-ie but it's a great team and they've helped me become confidant and passionate about the practice. The whole donation based thing is also great, they're never pushy or awkward about the tissue box which was an immediate concern for me. Go. Just go. You won't regret it, you'll just be hooked!",positive
"Over the past two months I have been consistently attending classes at YTTP, and I am so glad that I make time for yoga. They rotate teachers, but every teacher has been helpful and understanding, while adding their own flavor of their yoga practice. Every class I learn how to improve my practice and I feel more relaxed every time I walk out the door. Overall, I think that it is an excellent class, especially for being donation based.",positive
"I have never done yoga in my life, but was completely welcomed by the instructor and fellow students! Because this first time, I have no idea whether or not it was good by comparison to other classes, but I had a very fun time. It was much more strenuous and soothing than I could even imagine and I felt it was a steal for $12. That said, the yoga is free (suggested 10 dollar donation) and welcomes all levels of flexibility an experience. There is also a $2 rental fee for the yoga mat, but you can also bring your own. If you live in and around Tempe, yoga and this place are worth a try. I hope to see you there soon!",positive
"When I came to Tempe for graduate school two years ago, one of the things I was saddest to leave behind in Tucson was the wonderful $4 Yoga Hour at Yoga Oasis. I looked for a place to practice once I arrived, but I couldn't afford most studios on a graduate stipend, and I didn't like practicing at the rec center (ever tried to do happy baby in front of a bunch of frat boys?). So I stopped practicing. No longer! I went to class at Yoga To The People today and couldn't have been more pleased with my experience. The space was clean and peaceful, our instructor led us through a mindful practice with suggestions on how to make the poses easier or more challenging depending on experience. It felt very supportive and non-judgmental, even though I was one of only four (!) students there. What I like best is that they are DONATIONS BASED. Having felt like I had been priced out of studio practice, which is the best way for me to commit to yoga, I am so grateful that YTTP has come to Tempe. For now, I am just going to enjoy it until it gets crowded! And probably after that, too.",positive
This is my favorite location out of all of them!! The staff is really chill and that is what keeps us coming. Some of the other locations have the trainers that are rude and try acting all rough. Definitely recommend this location to youfit members or anyone near by looking for a membership.,positive
"I've been dealing with this youfit location and their corporate office for a month now to cancel the membership. After going into the location and paying the cancellation call, we've received calls roughly every other day from the billing department demanding additional cancellation fees. The representatives have been harassing. The cancelation was due to a family tragedy and no empathy has been offered. I've been told to call the independent location which I've done 5 times now with no resolution and no call back. The customer service of this company has been unacceptable and disappointing to say the least.",negative
"I have taken the time to get to know the people who work here before I joined, and they truly care about people. I have been going daily (except Sunday, that's church day) and I am very happy with You Fit and their employees, all you need to do is ask and they will help. A gym is your dedication and spirit you make it what it is.",positive
"I like this place cause it's nice and calm, not to packed when I go. The only downer is there is no steam rooms or pools to relax. Other than that it's pretty good has everything I need to work out. The people that go there seem to go to work out not stare at people so that's good!!!",positive
"I am so absolutely frustrated and dissapointed in the service I have recieved on behalf of my mother that I feel the need to express myself on every public outlet for others to see and be warned. I signed up for the membership for my mother who is battling with health issues that desperately require her to exercise to ease her pain. I told the rep that I would be responsible for paying the monthly membership fee and that she could pay for any additional services she wanted. My mother signed up for a personal trainer and was to pay $90 every two weeks. Well the 1st time they charged her over $100 and within 2 weeks following that, she paid an additional $180 and just 2 days later they charged my account for $90 which overdrew my account and caused my bank to charge me a $35 overdraft fee that was not returned. I was left unable to purchase gas to get to work and all I received was a ""It's not my fault, its how our billing is set up"" and an apology that really meant nothing. Almost a week later $90 was refunded to my account which really wasnt $90 because I was still charged the overdraft fee from my bank. Then today, my mother went in and was told she owed $180 dollars not even one week later!!!!Not only did it stress my mother, but it embarrassed her to the point where she no longer wants to go to that gym. I called and spoke with the rep who signed us up and he didn't care at all. I spoke with the General Manager there and she was frustrated but also said she would contact my mother to assure her it would be taken care of yet didn't call her. ""I'm sorry"" isn't enough. Its a clean, inexpensive gym, but the customer service sucks, and at this point I don't feel that our business is valued or welcomed and I don't recommend this type of treatment to ANYONE.",negative
"Since my last review I've had nothing but smiles and friendly greetings upon arrival. Thanks to the Gregory and the Youfit staff for taking my concern, albeit small, seriously. Now, this is the perfect gym for me. :)",positive
I've been going here for 4 months now. This is the first gym I've ever been in. Everything is always clean and the employees pleasant. Most of the time I go in about 4AM so my perception may be tainted by how quiet it is but there is a regular morning crowd and we all nod as we go in and out. I joined mostly to do cardio in a temperature regulated environment and that is working out much better than walking around the block for me. Sometimes I will use the circuit of machines. One time they failed to open and one time there was almost a whole row of broken machines but neither has turned into a regular problem.,positive
"Have you seen their commercial tagline ""no ball and chain, no pressure"" hhaa! I signed up for youfit seven months ago, paid a $10 monthly fee plus $30 annual fee. I asked them months ago to please cancel my membership as I had moved out of the area. I never ONCE used this gym because I joined a better gym near me with better equipment that wasn't old and broken and cracked! They refused to cancel my membership until I paid a $10 ""processing"" fee. ""Processing"" I presume means they tick an ""inactive"" button on my account that would take them 2 seconds. I even wrote them a letter months ago to cancel in addition to physically enter the gym to speak with someone. I was given such a hard time by the staff, they would not take my card or bank information off file and said my card would continually be charged the $10/mo. I finally had to put a stop payment through my bank, they are just thieves, I spent over $100 on a gym I never used because they wouldn't cancel my membership. I should have learned my lesson the first time with these crappy franchise gyms that suck you in with a low payment-no contract marketing scheme. I finally found a great gym that is not a franchise and is so much more professional and awesome. Don't get ""ball and chained"" by handing over your bank info to these guys.",negative
I joined the gym a year ago I got my own gym equipment so I went to cancel my membership a fee to cancel my membership come on really,negative
Great gym. Great price. Super clean. New equipment and staff are super friendly. I like the wide range of hours and all the drinks they have there.,positive
"This is the cleanest gym I have ever been in. The staff are all friendly, things get put away, and there are plenty of machines and weights so you can get an excellent workout. The stretching area is a bit small and they don't have a complete set of smaller barbells or easy bars, but you can work around that. No frills-- just a nice, bright, clean gym. We've belonged to four different gyms now (they keep getting sold and/or closing), and we are really happy at YouFit. The price is right too!",positive
"Well ... if I had written this review 8 months ago, it would probably have been different. However, since joining this gym (I have recently cancelled) things have changed drastically. When I joined, they had specific hours in which they were open for business. Mostly ok with that. However when PLANET FITNESS opened nearby, they revised their hours to 24/7 to complete. After only 1 month, they went back to only being open specific hours during each day. This is annoying. And recently their employees started POWER lifting, making grunting noises, and dropping large heavy weights, which scared the HELL out of me every time they drop the weights!!! Very annoying again! Then the final straw ... they no longer provide WI-FI for their members. This is a HUGE thing for me, and a deal breaker. I'm done. The management has recently changed as well, and he was completely rude and was NOT the least bit sympathetic when I voiced my concerns. He really didn't care that I was having issues and about to cancel my membership. So ok then ... I joined PLANET FITNESS, 1 mile away, and love it there.",negative
"I've never been to the gym, but still rating this based on the experience I had trying to even get information from them! After my frustrations, I can't foresee going there to work out. I've tried calling them twice, to find out about personal training costs. Don't get me wrong, both times they were nice, but I have still not received any information from them, even after giving them my e-mail address twice. I called and spoke with a gentleman a couple of weeks ago, and he kept asking me questions, but didn't seem to register my answers. I guess he was reading from a script. I don't like it when you ask someone what they charge for a service (which I did) and their response is, ""Well, what can you afford?"" or ""Well what is your budget?"" Instead of this translating to me that they're willing to negotiate a price, I get a used-car salesman feel of, ""We're willing to for you to pay much lower, but we won't tell you that. We'll find out what your max is, so we can push you as close to that dollar amount as possible."" I don't have a budget yet. I'm sorry... how about you give me some prices, and I'll figure out if I can afford it... The guy also asked when it was convenient for me to work out. I work during ""normal business hours,"" in fact later, so it would be late at night after my kids go to sleep, when someone else is at the house to be w/them, and I'm not an early riser/morning person, which I specifically told him. His response was, ""Well, if you can be there at five a.m. a personal trainer can be there for you."" Why ask me what my schedule is and when it would be convenient for me to work out, if you're going to tell me who is available when I'm not? I also had my weekend fully booked for my kids' activities, which I also told him multiple times, indicating I wasn't able to come in to talk to a manager, and that I would prefer they just e-mail me the information. Then, w/out listening, he said, ""Why don't you come in on Saturday, or Sunday, 9-2, when my manager is here, or come on Monday 8-5 when my manager is here?"" Um.... it's like I was talking to a wall b/c I had JUST said I wasn't available during those times! I'm not a ""lookie-loo"", but I'm not pulling teeth to get info. from them anymore and now have zero desire to go in and use their facility. If they're open 24/7, they should truly be available 24/7.",negative
"Not sure why this place gets bad reviews. This is by far the least aggravating gym I've ever been a member of. Their rates are $10 a month. yes there is a $30 annual fee, but its still only $150 a year. I can't find rates like that anywhere in town. I like that it is no frills. There is no juice bar, massage clinic, spinning class, etc. I've seen some new gyms that look more like a singles bar than a gym. They have at least 2 of everything, tons of treadmills and elliptical machines, and the one time that the machines I wanted to use were all busy, I hopped on a treadmill for 15 minutes and the place had cleared out. Also, unlike at other gyms I've gone to, the trainers don't come up and try to sell you on their services while you're trying to work out. I hated that at pure fitness. I don't love working out, but I don't hate it as much since I joined YouFit.",positive
I honestly am so disgusted with this place. The staff is unprofessional. 24 hour fitness is only maybe 10 dollars more a month with a better staff and better advisement of what you're actually signing a contract for. Won't let me cancel and I haven't used the gym once in the two weeks I've had the membership. Don't waste any money there.,negative
"This is unbelievable! I was just charged a 30 dollar ""annual fee"" which I was never made aware of. I have had more issues with non-disclosure with this gym that I will be closing my membership. I would rather pay more every month at another gym than to deal with a company that lies and doesn't tell you up front about extra fees! This is outrageous.",negative
"Just signed up for this gym its 10 dollars a month, no pool or bball courts. But they have a lot of treadmills and ellipticals which are good so you will never have to wait. Its been open for 6 months, the staff is very friendly and nice. David the manager told me about the place when it first opened. He is awesome and does a good job of keeping a good gym. There aren't any meatheads there which is good so people like me wont be intimidated.. haha very casual place to go work out just to stay in shape, not if you want to be mr. usa...or mrs...",positive
"I joined about 2 1/2 months ago and I LOVE coming here!!! I've never liked working out, be it alone at a gym, in group personal training or with a one-on-one trainer. But classes at ILKB are not only a killer workout, but FUN! I give full credit to the trainers - Alli, Ciara, Clarissa, Jesus, Ace and Tiffani. Such amazing people who are so encouraging and supportive - helpful and motivating. And the other class members are so friendly, too. I've made several friends so far in my short time there and when you consider we are all sweaty puddles by the end of the class, it's like a family for sure! Best workout I've ever had - full body - no muscle is safe!!! ILKB!!!!",positive
I love iLoveKickboxing! I feel so good doing the workout and even better after a workout! The Bonus is losing the twenty pounds I'm wanting to! The Staff does an Amazing and Awesome job at Encouraging and Supporting you through it from start to finish and the Staff knows you and treat you great! Oh and the Members here are just as supportive! These classes motivate me to come out and get into the habit of a daily fit routine that is FUN from beginning to end! Come out and have Fun with all of us and let iLoveKickboxing help you achieve your fitness goals!,positive
I love coming to kickboxing I've already lost 5 lbs in the first 2 weeks everyone is so helpful and the instructors are amazing.,positive
"ILKB Ahwatukee is one of the most fun but challenging work out I have ever done. You can feel the results and see them. The instructors are very lively, personable, and they become your family. I would recommend them to everyone!! ILKB You Knowww!!!!",positive
Totally cool place. Great people who workout at kickboxing and the instructors are amazing. I signed up for 5 classes and after the first day I signed up. Naomi and Kerri are so great to workout with because they work your butt off lol. If your looking for a great fun and amazing place to get a great workout come to ILKB.,positive
iLoveKickboxing is such a fun way to get in a quick yet effective workout everyday! Classes are only and hour long which makes it easy to fit into your schedule. The instructors are lively and motivating and the facility is very well maintained. 100% recommend to those looking to reach their fitness goals!!,positive
"A butt kicking, energizing, strength and stamina building workout. The instructors care about you and your goals. The owners are incredibly socially conscious people running a great company. This got me out of my fitness rut for sure!",positive
I love this place! The instructors are so friendly and helpful and keep you motivated throughout the entire workout! I recommend this place to anyone who wants a fun and rewarding experience!,positive
Where do I start? I don't even know when I joined but I have loved every minute of being a part of the ILKB family. I love the energy and the motivation I get from the instructors and the other members. I am on a track to lose weight and gain muscle so I can look stunning in my engagement photos and in my wedding dress a few months later. I am so glad that I was referred to ilkb. I have already seen a change in my energy and in my clothes becoming a little baggy. I never feel defeated when I leave and I am happy and excited to return the next day. I am so blessed to have an amazing gym family that knows my name when I walk in the door. This place is so much better than a regular gym. No machines. No pressure to compete. ILKB YOU KNOW!!!!,positive
"I am so excited to continue my journey with ILKB. I try to fit in my 3-4 classes a week, but when I don't, I refer to tips to do at home workouts that I have learned from instructors. Also, when I run, I push myself even harder since I know that I did when I was at an ILKB class!",positive
"LOVE LOVE LOVE these classes. I have only been in 5 classes and am already feeling different and noticing changes in my body and my performance. Each class is fun. Instructors are fantastic. Everyone is very nice. The gym is kept very clean! Highly recommend this as a great place for a full body, fun workout!",positive
Awesome workout! You will rain sweat if you work hard. Only kickboxing here not a typical gym which was fine with me! Great deal right now for 5 classes & gloves!,positive
Love this place! I signed up after my first class! The workout is awesome and so is the staff. Everyone is friendly and it's super clean.,positive
"Want to get lean? Want to gain muscle? This is not the place to go. They only have bags,no weights,no bands, nada. I was seriously disappointed and it was a HUGE waste of money. Sorry ILKB but you are a gym for new years resolutioners. You know the ones that go for a week and thats it.",negative
"The instructors are amazing and the only reason I would ever go back but the owners were so rude to me and made me feel like all they wanted was my money. I had signed up for the seven months worth of classes but then had to back out because of financial reasons. The instructor completely understood and told me i would get my refund because i backed out within three days of signing up. Then the owners I could tell were not happy with me having to back out. The man tried several times to get me to back out next time I came but i was persistent and finally got him to end it that night. He said my refund should come to me once it got processed through them first. So i waited a couple weeks then finally had to call. I talked to the other owner on the phone and she ended up telling me they don't give refunds, which i find hard to believe. I really would have loved to come back once I could afford it but now I'm definitely not.",negative
I joined a couple of weeks ago and everytime I go workout I am greeted with open arms. The workout is awesome and the encouragement from the staff is fantastic! I highly recommend joining.,positive
iLoveKickboxing.com has been an amazing new experience for me. Their staff is so friendly and welcome you in where you feel like family day one! It's a workout I look forward to on a daily basis that kicks my butt and leaves me feeling great and energized! I highly recommend adding ILKB into your weekly routine!,positive
"iLoveKickboxing changed my life and become a major part of it. The staff are so awesome and motivating. It truly is a family that supports you. And boy do you sweat, they kick your butt in a good way! It's honestly the highlight of my day and has become addicting. Can't recommend it enough!!",positive
"This place is awesome. Instructors : Rachel, Chachi and Daniel are so helpful and fun to be with. Intense workout.. but I so love it!! No Pain No Gain. I've gained more self confidence, more energy and just a whole different person since I signed up.. and guess what!! I signed up for the rest of the year.. yeah to #ILOVEKICKBOXING!!",positive
"Tried Quad for the first time. For the record, I cycle and swim regularly. However, 3/4 of the way into the class, there was literally a lack of oxygen in the room. The basement with poor ventilation situation with no windows open is extremely unsafe. Add 50+ people overexerting. It was hot, humid, lacked any ventilation or fresh air. I started feeling light-headed, and not from the workout. I took my oxygen saturation reading immediately after leaving class (I happen to work in this field and had a diagnostic device on me at the time) and verified that I was actually hypoxic. Stop cramming so many people and bikes into the room, crack open a window/figure out ventilation before one of your patrons passes out and sues you.",negative
"I really want to LOVE this place. It's a convenient location. I love the underground feel. Checking in is super straightforward, as are the changing rooms. I've been for two classes now and the workout has been something I'm feeling the next day. BUT! I am a bit floored by the two instructors I experienced. They were both male and both employed full-on screamo band voices when counting down, or saying, ""let's go!!!!!!!!!!!!"". Guttural. Downright frightening. Someone else's vibe perhaps, but not mine. I was spinning away, but looking around like, ""Am I the only person hearing this absolute goul voice?"". To each their own. I will definitely be returning, but I think it's still a matter of finding my perfect instructor.",positive
"I have taken spinning before, so this was not my first time. But the instructor was good, and the class was challenging. I went during lunch time on a weekday, so it was not crowded at all. I agree with other reviewers that it can seem cramped down in the basement, but since there weren't too many others taking class, I did not feel uncomfortable. Would go again.",positive
"I have gone to many spin studios across the city over the years and this might be my least favourite. The King location is dark and smelly and damp (being a basement and all) but the Leslieville location is nice. The bikes are poorly maintained. The place is often crowded. The change room at the King location is cramped and people are always putting their bags on the benches so there is nowhere to sit (the benches are for asses, not bags, people!). My main complaint though is that the instructors are not good. As a fitness buff and someone who appreciates getting taught by people who know more about proper training, fitness and exercise physiology than I do (isn't that what I am paying for - their expertise and guidance?), the Quad instructors do not fit the bill. All of the ones I have had just pound it out on the bike, having you jump up and down in your seat and there seems to be little method to their madness. I guess it makes it ""fun"" and ""energetic"" for people, which is fine if that is all you are looking for. I am looking for a good workout though that has exercise science to back it up, and so that I am getting the most out of my time. I don't feel that I get this here. If others are looking for the same kind of workout as I am, I highly recommend the nearby Cykl. The instructors there are actually competitive/sport cyclists themselves and/or know the science behind the exercise. This is evident through how they guide you through intervals at key moments, hill rides at key moments, active recovery phases, anaerobic vs. aerobic threshold, etc.. they also explain their workout to you in advance so you know what to expect (the quad instructors I have had never do this). I appreciate the enthusiasm of Quad instructors, but enthusiasm for spinning is not enough. You can tell when you read the bios on the Quad website as well - most do not have training or sport backgrounds (although some do). Many seemed to have come to it because they went to classes and liked it, so decided to teach. It would be more helpful if they understood proper exercise training better and developed their workouts in that way. That is a large part of what I expect in a fitness instructor. Also, I do spin primarily for the cardio workout, but I find I don't get that here in an effective way (due to the lack of knowledge of the intructors on things like proper interval training, which is by far the most effective way to develop your cardio fitness). If you are just looking for energy, loud music and more of a dance club vibe, and a place to just peddle and jump up and down to your heart's content, then this might be your kind of place.. but if you are looking for a more serious exercise routine (and by serious, i don't mean not fun!) where the instructor knows how to guide you through a proper workout that is based on the latest exercise science and real training techniques, then this place might not be for you.",negative
Have to say it's kinda cool going downstairs into this spin studio dungeon. Unfortunately I did not enjoy the bikes they are rather old and the sound system is awful but from where I was on the left of the instructor I could not hear their voice as the bass was too Boom boom. Also does not help when the main speakers are behind the audience.,negative
"I'm torn between giving this place 5 stars (for the instructors) and 0 stars for the facilities and patrons. I purchased a 2 week unlimited pass over the holidays and went more than half a dozen times. Let me start with the positives. Instructors: One word - AMAZING! I've been spinning for years and the instructors here give me a run for my money. They are high energy, effective, and intense. It felt like classes taught by aggressive downtown bike couriers on steroids. That's everything nice i have to say about Quad. Now on to the negatives. Bikes: One word - DILAPIDATED. Holy shit i don't think i saw a single bike in there that wasn't rusty. If you show up wearing runners instead of spinning shoes, good luck. All their foot straps are faulty. The bikes are old and poorly maintained and none of them have a watt meter. I tried four different bikes and the brakes on some of them are so hard that turning the knob by more than 2 centimeters renders it unmovable. Facilities: Unacceptable at best. Tiny change rooms that cannot possibly accommodate the 30-60 women they attempt to cram into a dark and dank basement. Ventilation is extremely poor and there is no room to stretch before and after each class because your neighbor is practically sitting on your bike seat. It's like bikram spinning on a crowded train in Mumbai. Reception: They don't even have a key card scanner so anyone who shows up has to present their membership card to the receptionist who manually enters names into a log book. At one point I've seen 20 people queue up to check in. Really? I didn't realize i stepped into a basement and got transported to 1973. Patrons: Oddly competitive and bitchy. During the 50 minute session you'll have women clad in head to toe lululemon attire (regardless of age) staring at or giving other spinners the side eye. It got so bad that during one class the instructor reiterated at least 8-10 times that we are not competing with each other and that we should focus on our own efforts, nobody cares if you're the fastest spinner in here etc. These bitches need to calm the fuck down. If you're so good at cycling your ass would be competing in the Tour de France and not sardined in a clammy and odorous basement in Toronto. Again it was a tremendous workout despite the shitty equipment, shitty people and ineffective front desk.",negative
"I was browsing some exercise that makes me repeat my visits to work out and a girlfriend talked to me about this place and we started going together. I was amazed with the energy in the air, the loud and vibrant music and the staff. The studio I enjoy the most is the Queen East one. I am not a fan of the King West one. It's dark and old. The changing room is not comfortable, a totally contrary experience is Queen East. A clearer location with 2 changing rooms (1 at the main level and other in the second level). Classes price are within market price range, not cheaper not more expensive. This new year before committing myself with a 3 or 6 months membership I am going to explore other spinning studios. I hope to update my review when I finish my expedition!",positive
"Anyone who wants to cycle, I recommend to definitely try Quad. Quad was initially very intimidating for me as I was a beginner and I didn't know what to expect, but after the first class I was hooked! Everyone is really friendly and the energy you feel while riding is amazing! All instructors are great, that always switch things up and play a wide selection of music! From past experience, I advise to sign up for classes ahead of time online and get their early to change/grab a bike as it can get pretty packed.",positive
"Dark, damp and loud. Perfect. Love this spot for spinning classes. Everyone is really friendly and it feels like an underground dance party when you're riding. I like the changerooms and this place just has a good feel to it. I will definitely be back for more classes.",positive
"Quad is a wonderful place to exercise. I have been going for the past 6 months and I have never looked back. The instructors are friendly, the space at both Quad and Quad East are beautiful and the bikes are in good condition. I can truly say Quad turned my fitness routine around and I feel that I am in the best shape I have ever been. They are great with beginners and will take time to set you up on the bike. GO TRY IT OUT!",positive
"Fantastic spin place! I'm back in Toronto temporarily and took a intro class and went back again today, this place is just great. Everyone has been so friendly, welcoming and most importantly encouraging. I've only experienced two classes and both were fantastic instructors who knew how to play current and updated music. Most of the spin classes I've attended in the past are a bit, well - meh. Quad was super, by far the best spin class I've ever been to. The only downfall is I have to go back to Vancouver and there is no place like this. Anyone who wants to cycle should definitely try Quad.",positive
I started at Quad in January and I have enjoyed my experience. The change rooms are small and ventilation could be a bit better but I will continue to go and renew my membership. I did alot of hunting before signing up for membership at a Spin studio. The instructors are positive and generally have a great energy. When I first started I was a complete novice and the instructor helped get me set up. She would also check in after a few weeks to see if the configuration was still good and notice if I made tweaks along the way. I will say that Quinton's 1 hour endurance class is by far the best reason to keep going back. If you like pushing yourself check that one out. It' s not cheap but I get alot of value out of it.,positive
"I'm taking an 8-week class at Quad right now and I'm two weeks in and loving it. As other reviewers are saying, it's a bit cramped, but really, you're intended to be on your bike for the duration of class so once you're on, it's not a big problem. Packed classes just mean more sweating and isn't that the point? The instructors are fantastic, funny, and motivating. Music is selected to be motivating too and cranked which just makes me want to go faster!! They've got a disco ball and coloured lights set up too to keep you pumped about being there. We did abs after our last class and that's when the cramped space becomes more of an issue, but we made it work... and it still hurts to laugh so I know it was worth staying for.",positive
"Great for in the winter when I'm not riding my real bike. I loved Matt's Sunday am class but I haven't been back since he's left. I plan to return in the fall though. I always feel like I get a great workout. I agree with the other reviewer though....it can feel a little squishy when full and boy does it get hot, hot, hot!",positive
"One of the best barbershops I've been to, with great prices. I honestly couldn't be happier with the love that comes out of this place, the environment is quite amazing and comfortable. I remember the day I found this place, they've been a success with my cuts since day 1. Thank you.",positive
Took my son in for a haircut. Barber was great he did exactly what I wanted. Very clean cut will definitely be coming in more often.,positive
"Walked in, said hi. The only barber in there did not have a courtesy to say hi back. He was too busy watching the soccer game while cutting the hair. Stood in front of the reception desk for few minutes. Nothing. Left and will not be back.",negative
I came here 10 minutes before 9am to get a haircut. They are open at 9am on Saturday's according to their hours of operation. It is now 9:15 and I left because no one showed up. There was 5 other people waiting as well and they didn't seem too happy either. I am in search of a new Barber but it definitely will not be here.,negative
"Great haircut. No fuss no muss, I asked for layers and ""V"" shape to the back. Exactly what I ordered. And the price? Awesome! Under $20 for a haircut? You can't beat it. I will be returning to this salon.",positive
"Love this place great atmosphere and energy. Very convenient place I can get everything in one stop from an outfit and accessories to mani, pedi and hair a true one stop salon. I will recommend to any one.",positive
Loved this salon. It is very clean an smells good all the clients walking out had beautiful hair. I was really pleased with my stylist Tammi Mitchell. Lots of great deals. I will definitely be back,positive
"I will never recommend this business to anyone. The owner, Lidia, was so rude and unprofessional. She belittled me and wasn't even interested in taking my name. I suppose what you look like is all that matters to her, not the money in your pocket.",negative
"I bought a Groupon from Sandra Lynn Rosendin for a mani-pedi, not realizing how far this salon was from The Strip. I actually spent more in Uber transport to the appointment than I spent on the Groupon. I was glad I hadn't done the bus--as I had planned. Too far! BUT...Sandra Lynn did a great job, and, really, no regrets. She took good care of me, and if I were a local, I would be there every week, asking S.L. to continue my great mani-pedi care. She was busy, on New Year's Eve day, and took me at 12:30pm because she had a cancellation. She had been willing to stay late to honor my Groupon--even on a holiday, even knowing I wasn't a local, and thus a repeat customer. Now, that's kindness, AND good service. Thank you Sandra Lynn! You made my day. I cannot say enough: CALL SANDRA Lynn. She will do an awesome job and has a sunny attitude. They offer a first time discount at this salon, so why not give it a try.",positive
Ester is fabulous with hair. She colors and nourishes your hair with so much care. You leave there wanting to keep running your fingers through it. I love my hair!!!! Ester is the BEST!!!!,positive
Oh my gosh....I had to post. I love my hair extensions! Thank you...the lady who did them was Ester. She was awesome. I can't wait to show my boyfriend :) I called and got prices from many salons and this one was the best for what you get. It was on W Sahara...a little out of my way because I live in Green Valley but worth the drive.,positive
"I love this place! My hairdresser Ester is the Best! She has done my 20"" extensions for over 3 years and this salon is great. The owners are accessible and down to earth. They love their clients and we LOVE them!",positive
First time at Adore and a I had a great experience. Cheryl did an awesome job. I got my haircut exactly the way I wanted. She is an excellent hairstylist. I totally recommend this place.,positive
"Risa is the best stylist ever!! I have difficult curly hair and Risa was really good about making it look great. She is attentive, works well with you in reaching hair goals like getting dead hair to a healthier state. TOTALLY going to her again. XD",positive
"First time here at Adore. It has a great atmosphere and the service is prompt and courteous. Jen Lewis is the stylist that cut my hair. She has a great eye and makes sure that the style you ask for will really work for your face shape and style. Jen is very meticulous, creating exactly the look you want. I would recommend her to anyone needing a new stylist in the Las Vegas area!",positive
Loved coming here to get my weekly haircut with my barber UNTIL they suddenly closed it down. Worst part is I was told via text! I can understand a text appointment reminder or even text cancelation but to tell me the barbershop is closing down and my barber is no long with the company is in bad taste 100%. I had higher expectations for this place.,negative
"The staff was incredibly nice and the location is beautiful. I was disappointed, however, because they did two spray tans and neither was what I was looking for. The second appointment was to correct the first but it still didn't come out. People kept asking me when I was going to get a tan bc you couldn't really tell a difference at all. I was bummed with the results.",negative
"I go to Charissa at Altered Ego and I am always satisfied with the results. I am the kind of person who has an idea of what i want when i go in, but im not always sure how it will look. She does a terrific job of taking a little guidance and running with it and she is not afraid to give her opinion or give you something to consider when you are trying something new. I love love love my cut and color! Thanks Charissa! P.S. it doesn't hurt there is a cute little coffee shop literally within 100 feet of the salon. That can be a life-saver!",positive
"Sat at the salon for an hour arguing with the stylist on what I wanted(had a picture). Then she tells me that they didn't book enough time for me to get anything done past a hair cut..I wanted a cut and balayage. When I booked I was told I was the last appt for her so she would have plenty of time and I overly explained to whoever booked the appt, that I had a lot of hair(just thick)and needed time. I understand that when it comes to color, it might take a session or two. But the whole reason I went to this place was because the last salon I talked to said that they were going to charge me $300 for what I wanted done which I know is bogus because I'm cutting off half of my hair and I'm not coloring my whole head! I went completely blonde for $150!! And it was perfect! So I tried this place and turns out they overbooked and underquoted me. I walked out frustrated, upset and will never be back. Unbelievable....if you have a lot of hair, I do not recommend.",negative
"HUGE shout out to Kasondra for rescuing my hair! After a botched balayage-turned-90s highlight job that was done at another salon, I stopped by Altered Ego for a consultation since it was on my way home. When I told the very nice receptionist what had happened, she grabbed Kasondra and Kasondra took her time in telling me how exactly she would fix it and how much it would cost. I booked an appointment for two days later and couldn't be happier with the results. Kasondra is also very sweet and made the entire process comfortable and enjoyable. The atmosphere of the place is also awesome, the decor is really pretty and all of the stylists there seemed to be having a good time and enjoying each other's company. I am so happy to have found my new salon, even if it started from less than ideal circumstances. P.S. The coffee shop is also very good!",positive
"The salon is cute, clean, and filled with chandeliers! Angie did an excellent job with my hair! She listened to my general idea, exasperated by the fact I'm pregnant and always burning up, and gave me a cut that is cute, easy to style, and, best of all, light and short enough to keep me cool! I've definitely found my stylist and will return to Angie at Altered Ego again and again. The prices are reasonable, and the salon offers a wide variety of products. I also had a coupon for a drink at the espresso bar next door with Male Ego, and my drink was delicious :)",positive
"Lauren was my stylist and she did AMAZING! I showed her a picture of the blonde I wanted and explained I didn't want it as light as the picture, but not like the golden blonde I had. She was super nice the entire time and my hair turned out perfectly. I am so happy I went today and will definitely be coming back!",positive
"This is the first salon that has gained my trust in quite a while. It's always difficult to find somewhere new after a move. However, I was recommended by my roommate to book an appointment with Mylissa and judging by the job she did on my roomate's hair, I was sold. She is the biggest sweetheart ever, loves her job, and her clients! She really worked with me and achieved exactly what I wanted. She's great at doing color corrections, color melts, ombres, and cuts. Her hands are like magic and she is an artist in the Salon world. I probably won't be visiting any other stylist while I live here in Tempe. This shop has a great energy. Everyone is so welcoming and happy to be here! :)",positive
"What was a perfect day was ruined by horrible customer service. Let's start from the beginning. I'm getting married and came to learn about Altered Ego at the AZ bridal show. At the show I was attracted to them because they did vintage hairstyles. I was given a $50 gift card at the bridal show. I called today to get info on how the bridal hair works. I was informed that for $50 I could do a trial run. They had a cancellation and were able to get me in today. Upon arriving to the shop I was greeted by two friendly ladies at the front desk. I had to wait a little longer than expected but didn't mind since the atmosphere was inviting. Nicque my stylist came out and escorted me to the joint coffee shop called Solo. Cool concept, you can order a variety of drinks and pay for it when you pay for your salon services. I get into Nicques chair and she's awesome! Easy to talk to and very knowledgeable. We did a vintage updo and it took about 1 1/2 hour. She's very detailed and passionate about her work. I decided to book my bridal party and self for my October wedding. I'm escorted to the front desk and get prepared to pay. I add a 20 tip for Nicque and I'm told the trial will be $80 instead of $50 because it was a detailed style. No biggie I hand over my gift card and the lady at the register said it wasn't working. She goes and speaks to the manager/owner and comes back and tells me unfortunately it was for hair extensions not the service I received. I end up paying $104 for a hair consult. I'm annoyed but pay. I leave sit in my car and look at the gift card. It states: To Bride- from: terri- $50- bride consult. So I go back in. I say that I'm not trying to make a big fuss but I'm left with a bad taste that this gift card is being refused when it does not state that it can only be used for extensions. The owner/manager comes out. She explains to me that this gift card is for another service and she's sorry about the miss communication but I should have let them know prior to my service that I had a gift card and the gift card says Terri but Nicque did my hair. She then tells me how nice my hair is. I am not arguing that I like my hair I'm arguing that the gift card is being refused! She talked down to me and told me she wasn't really sure what I was wanting her to do. I get upset and start to get teary eyed. This is customer service 101 I'm about to bring 4-5 bridesmaids to get salon and she's fighting me for $50! She tells me that she feels bad about the miscommunication. She then tells me that she can meet me halfway and give me $25 off on my wedding day. She states that she thinks that's fair since the gift card is for a completely different service. I just stand there tears falling down my face because I'm so infuriated. She also jokes that if they gave every bride at the expo a $50 gift card they'd not be in business. I wasn't looking for the style to be free. I wanted the gift card to be honored. She should have done the right thing and honored it. I was called after I left and my sweet stylist Nicque offered to honor the gift card on my wedding day. I now however have such a bad taste for this and I absolutely do not want to support the owner of the salon. It sucks because I loved my hair but you never argue with a customer. Also don't hand out fake gift cards that mean nothing! I left in tears furious that I spent that much for a trial and will be expected to pay more on my wedding day. They should have their pricing written down and be clear about what youre paying for.",negative
Kudos to Gaby who did an amazing job with my hair!!! I love the refreshing new look she gave and the professional subtle atmosphere that lingers in the place! Now I'm a regular client!,positive
"One phrase to describe my most recent hair experience: Pinterest Worthy! Kasondra did an amazing job creating the perfect bayalage summer hair. She is a great stylist for curly hair, and knows how to cut it perfectly every time. If you're in Tempe looking for a great stylist and salon, definitely give Altered Ego a call!",positive
"I get my hair colored and cut by Mylisa and I get my extensions done by Terri! They are both amazing and know exactly what I want! I have very fine, thin hair and they know what will look good with my hair and what won't. Terri has been doing my extensions for almost two years now and she customizes them for my hair. Makes the bond smaller so they will lay very flat and so they won't be noticeable. They look very natural! No one knows they are extensions and are very shocked when I tell them that they are! She is amazing! Mylisa is amazing with balayage and color! She has been doing mine for a while now. I love how sun kissed it looks! Perfect for summer!",positive
Mylisa was my styalist and she was amazing!! She was great to take to and did amazing work! I got a grey/silver all over and couldn't have asked for better!! If you're wanting anything a little crazy or colorful I would HIGHLY recommend her!!,positive
"This was my first trip to this salon. I decided to head over to this salon just because of the amazing Yelp reviews. To say the least; my fellow Yelpers never let me down. From the jump my experience was amazing! The ladies that helped me to book my appointment took the time to listen to what I wanted and where I currently was with my hair to match me up with hands down the most personable super talented stylist. Ms Timiko! Forgive me if I'm spelling your name wrong... Not only does she take time to listen to what I wanted, she took time to explain what would look the best on me and how she planned on accomplishing that look. She went above and beyond what any other stylist has done for me in the past. Talk about raising the bar! I'm soooooo happy with my new haircut and I sooo enjoyed all the laughs and great conversation with Timiko. I also enjoyed a hot skinny Vanilla latte that was made for me less than a few feet away while I was getting my hair done. The coffee joint is inside of this salon. A fabulous cut, tasty latte, and fantastic company to boot. Doesn't get much better than this thank you !!!!",positive
"We are spending a few months in the Mesa / Tempe area and I'd decided to get my long hair cut. On the recommendation of two friends I went to a stylist at another salon. I was really disappointed with that experience and the cut, even though I'd showed her three pics of what I was wanting. I found Altered Ego here on Yelp and was able to get an appointment with Tiffany. I showed her the same pics I'd showed the other stylist and she ""got it""! She did a great job cutting my hair and I will be going back to her next time we're here! The whole salon experience was fantastic! Thanks for rescuing me Tiffany!",positive
"I've been searching for a hair stylist ever since I moved to the PHX valley 5 years ago. YIPPEE!!!! I found her!!!! Kassondra is incredible! She's great w/ color & I hardly have to spend any time on my hair due to it FINALLY being cut properly. Once again I am getting compliments on my hair & people asking....""Who's your stylist?"" Great color, great cut.....one happy girl I am! Thx Kassondra!!",positive
"Decided to take a closer look at Altered Ego after reading their overwhelmingly positive reviews here on Yelp. It is also less than a ten-minute drive from my home. I made a trial appointment for an updo with Tawni, the owner. She specializes in updos, and I wanted to look ""done-up"" but still like me for my elopement. Tawni TOTALLY delivered! The day of the trial, we chatted about my ideas, and I showed her a Pinterest pin board I had created. We went off of one key pin, and Tawni played around with the style. Then she took tons of photos on her iPhone and emailed them to me so I could process the hairstyle at home over the next week. I decided that I wanted even more curls/texture/volume, and that I wanted the fishtail braid a bit longer than in our trial. The morning of my elopement, Tawni opened her shop EARLY for me. My hair was ABSOLUTELY PERFECT. The photos I attach will do most of the talking, but I must say that this was a fantastic experience. Tawni was exceptionally professional, as was her assistant (Megan?). They had huge smiles on their faces the entire time my hair was being done; it felt SO good to know that I was in good hands, and that these professionals truly love what they do. I would recommend any bride-to-be to check out Altered Ego and to consult with Tawni on the style you've been dreaming of. THANK YOU!

Great Salon! They do great work and have really fun events! I highly recommend Topher! He is fabulous at what he does!!!!,positive
I love this Salon! It has an awesome atmosphere and great stylists. I would highly recommend Topher. Not only did he give me an amazing cut but he also gave me tips on how to style my hair. After informing him that most days I choose extra sleep over styling he taught me how to do a ten minute blow dry. I have been doing it this past week and I am impressed with how much better my hair looks!,positive
"I am very particular when it comes to my hair and after moving to Arizona it was my mission to find a place i could go to and leave feeling great about my hair. I went to other salons before finding Altered Ego, and I have to say I wish I found Alter Ego first!! I made an appointment and was introduced to Topher. I gave a brief sentence on how I usually cut my hair and Topher went to work. He knew exactly what I wanted from a few words. It is hard to find a salon and hair stylist that can understand their clients needs from a few words. With Topher there was no issue. I can honestly say that every time I go in for a hair cut with Topher I leave knowing my hair will look amazing. Definitely the place to go if you want great service and an amazing haircut.",positive
Tiffany the nail tech at Altered Ego is amazing and does an excellent job with both manis and pedis. She is very precise in her work and is focused on what the customer wants. I have been going to Tiffany for 4+ years and I couldn't be happier!,positive
"I moved from out of state a little over a year ago and found Tina as my hairstylist! Normally it takes me a couple of tries with a stylist before finding one who truly knows how to work with my red coarse/curly hair, but with finding Tina, I never needed to try elsewhere. She is AMAZING with color. She found the perfect 2 colors that complement my natural red and I love it! I am constantly getting compliments while out and about on my hair color. Tina definitely knows how to make your hair look great!!",positive
I have seen Tiffany for a little over a year and she has been my saving grace for my nails! Such a sweet and outgoing women! The salons energy is upbeat and extremely fun! All of the staff is efficient and friendly. I was in love with this place from the first time I went! Outstanding!,positive
I absolutely loved this salon! I went with my sister to her hair appointment because she was nervous to try a new place. When we got there we were actually greeted by the stylist KASONDRA and she was incredibly sweet and energetic. She accommodated me and made sure I was comfortable even though I was not her client. The damask decorations and fun upbeat music was an added plus. I loved it there so much that I traveled from Peoria to Tempe again the next week so that Kasondra could cut my hair too. She did such a thorough an fantastic job on both mine and my sisters hair that I will be continuing to drive and hour just to see her! I'm going to get my hair colored by her next so I will add to my review with comments from that too :),positive
Went for months - I have baby fine wavy hair so no texturizing - apparently this is not something they understand as I left in July with a head full of texture - never went back.,negative
"After much stylist turmoil and almost a year without a haircut because I was in denial I came to yelp and found Altered Ego. It's close to my house and had great reviews. I booked an appointment with Marla and went in for a much shorter cut. She took her time and made sure it was what I wanted. Several hours after my appointment I realized that I just didn't like it. For the first time in my life I called and asked if I could come back to have some adjustments made. Marla made time the same day and gave the cut more ""wow"" and an edgier flare. She followed up with me TWICE to make sure I still liked it. The final product was fabulous and I have received many compliments on my new ""do"". I will be returning for furture cuts!",positive
"I went to this salon yesterday, and Billy booked me last minute because I could not stand one more day with my hair or I was going to cut it myself. LOL. Amor was kind enough to stay late to accomodate my haircut and color. I really had no idea what kind of color I wanted so Amor helped me choose a brown that was a bit lighter than my mousey hair. Only, once it was on, it had a very orangish tint. So she went back and put a toner on it and it helped calm down some of the brassiness (sp?) However, its still kinda orange, when I ask my friends what color my hair is...they say...""hmmmm I can't put my finger on it. It looks good though!"" I think I will wait a few days to see how it sets...I think it will work out great. The best part though is my haircut. I LOVE IT! I have thick hair that cannot be touched with thinning shears, Amor really took her time to make sure all my layers flow seamlessly together, and she thinned my hair using regular scissors. It has been a long time since I have had such a great hair cut. It usually comes out disjointed and frizzy, and blunt looking. Overall I had a great experience, and will definately come back to see Amor in the future. Oh I saw some lady get a spray tan...it looked so real! I think I will have to try that out too.",positive
"Unfortunately, my hair stylist from hair pollution, Darcy, moved up to north Scottsdale and this would have been too much of the commute for me so i had to start looking for a new place and stylist. This place is absolutely awesome, the staff is super friendly and were kind enough to accommodate my sister who just needed her ends trimmed, oh and the stylist didn't even charge her for it! Anyways, they took me in right away and my hair stylist Rebecca is this cute brunette with long locks and I have long hair so I was very comfortable with her cutting my hair. She washed, cut, and styled my hair in 45 minutes and my hair looked fabulous and healthy oh and the price wasn't bad to boot! This is my new place!",positive
"I received my first haircut here as a curly girl! Terri cut my hair, using the Deva technique ( wedge cut). Of course I was a bit nervous at first--but after having a short consultation with her before having my hair cut I was totally comfortable. I loved the results and she even told me to come back if I had any straggly ends. I love everything about this salon, everyone is friendly, unlike some salons, where you walk in and the shop goes completely silent. LOL. The owner is awesome too! THANKS TERRI!",positive
"GREAT SALON! I was looking for a fresh new haircut and one the the stylist, Tyler Colman, helped me out with the exact look I was going for. Ask for Tyler, he is a super hip guy that knows about the latest styles and is very experienced.",positive
"Stephanie is the best! I have extremely thick, curly hair and she always trims it perfectly for me. I even trusted her with shaving my undercut a while back. She comes up with the best designs to shave and the cutest colors to dye. Whether your hair is curly or straight, you want a cut or color or just a wash, Stephanie is your girl",positive
"I have now been coming to Amazing Cuts for about a year or so. Every single time I've come, I've had a different stylist work on me. I have yet to have a single experience where i didn't leave with a smile on my face. Each stylist, including the manager or owner or so friendly. They say goodbye, and call you out by your name. They look you in the eye and treat you with respect. This place opens up early too. 8:00 or 8:30 am at the latest. They are open 7 days a week. They have high quality work. And to add a cherry to the top of the sundae, they are extremely affordable. They make it easy for this goofy looking guy to feel good. Thanks Amazing Cuts!!",positive
Steph has been doing my hair for years. She does any hair type and isn't afraid to do some crazy colors. Highly recommend this salon. Then entire staff is super friendly and inviting. It is easier to make an appointment as the salon stays busy all day.,positive
"Being going here for a year now and I haven't got a bad haircut yet. Anesia always leaves me with a perfect fade/cut that I get on a weekly basis. All the staff here are friendly, remember your name, and make sure your appointments are accurate. I highly recommend this place to anyone, both male and female, who value their hair and appearance!",positive
"I love this place, my son found it with his friends and he is very picky with his hair. I finally gave it a try and love it, I got hair and color. Took me forever to find a place I like.",positive
Go see Misty at Amazing Cuts. I've followed Misty from another salon and wouldn't let anyone else cut my hair. She is knowledgeable and professional all the time and is always has a great attitude.,positive
"Amber did a last minute cut and beard trim on my husband and it is fabulous! He gets so many compliments and I love it. She got us in the same day and we couldn't be happier. She'll definitely be his go to stylest! Ryan also got me in last minute for a women's cut. I got an aline bob and didn't want to lose any length because I'm growing out a Mohawk. She was awesome and understood exactly what I wanted. My hair is healthy and now has a cute style with clean ends. She's definitely my new stylest! The place is clean, modern, and extremely well priced! You can't go wrong here.",positive
"I've been going there for about 2 years now. I've gone through several stylist and they all were good, but then I discovered Darian she's the best! Great Charming attitude always makes sure that you're satisfied with your haircut, and cuts it the way you want, doesn't rush.",positive
"I came in today on the verge of tears with a hair emergency. My dry damaged frizzy hair was out of control and I was slated to give a talk in the morning. Darion was a miracle worker! She took her time and did an incredible job treating and styling my hair, even going so far as to make sure it looked just as nice the next day. She's easy to talk to and wise beyond her years. I highly recommend her as a stylist and a person.",positive
"I took my 4 yr old here for her first hair cut . It was busy, but they got us to someone with in 10 mins. Her name I believe was Taylor she was very nice. My daughter has an extremely soft head and very rough hair to brush bc of the curls but she did it so gently my daughter didn't cry or fidget. It was quick and easy . She recommended products outside their store for a hopefully easier experience when we brush it. Will deff go back.",positive
"Unprofessional I won't spend my money here again!Over a year ago I had my hair done by Jessica she damaged my hair so bad I had to cut my hair to my Collarbone and my hair was under my shoulder blades. I'm still trying to grow out the damage she did to my hair. Today I went to get my daughter a hair cut and the girl at the front desk remembered me and I told her about the horrible job Jessica did to my hair and that's why I haven't been back. She apologized....Then the girl went and told two other girls at the front desk and the two girls began to gossip and kept looking at me and I was staring directly at them to let them know that I see you talking, and maybe you should be professional and gossip when I leave. Then one of the girls called my daughters name and she seen it was me and looked over to the older lady with bugged out eyes and they began to gossip again as my daughter and I walked over to her. This place is so unprofessional! Your hair stylists damaged my hair so bad and you sit there and gossip and looking directly at me as your doing it with not a care..... disgusting! Great customer service.....I wish I didn't even have to give them a 1 Star!",negative
"Amber cut my hair today, she did an excellent job. I am very particular about my hair and was a little reluctant because I've never seen her work before. She made me feel very relaxed and comfortable with her pleasant personality and confident demeanor. I would recommend her to anyone sceptical about who cuts their hair. I would recommend making an appointment because she's in high demand.",positive
"My family and I have been coming here for a few years now and have always had good experiences. We now have been making appointments with Darion, she does a excellent job and always makes sure we are satisfied with our cuts. Thanks Darion, keep up the good work!",positive
"I had a few experiences here. Both times was with Vanessa!! She's awesome!! $13 for a cut and style. The first experience was with a friend of mine. She needed a haircut so we came here to amazing cuts and got Vanessa. She did an awesome job on her hair. So I decided that day that I will make an appointment to see her soon. The second time that I came was for me, I needed a haircut because I wanted to donate my hair as my hair was way too long! She did a great job cutting my hair as I showed her a picture of a hair style that I wanted and she went above my expectations of a haircut! It's been a week and I love my haircut. I will be back next time!! So will my friend as she will continue to see Vanessa!! Keep up the great work.",positive
"Great prices and products available. Janka is amazing, she color & cuts my mom, grandma and myself. She also does my husband's hair.",positive
"Wow. Amazing cut is right!! I took the advice of another fellow yelper and stopped in to this place in the hopes of getting a decent trim with no appointment totally last minute. Tall order I know, but based on the reviews I decided to give it a try. I'm super glad that I did!! I was able to be seen by Vanessa and she is so great! Super friendly, great cut and style too! I already made my appointment for color next week. Do yourself a favor and check this place out but if you want the amazing Vanessa I recommend that you make an appointment because I'm pretty sure that I just got lucky today.",positive
I have been put on hold by a snappy lady and left on hold for 1 hour and 20 minutes. Then I asked for the owner and she hung up. I called back to speak with th eowner Robert who was very rude and hung up on me too. Very unprofessional.,negative
"Great shop with $11 haircuts, good for a trim for my long hair and bangs where elsewhere it is at least $25. Cecilia helped me, took her time and made sure I was okay with what she was doing. Definitely a place I would go to again",positive
"Great customer service, close to my house and a very good haircut. Me and my 3 boys have been coming here for two years and walk out with good haircuts every time. It's hit and miss on how long the wait is and found that it's hard to predict a good time to walk-in as some weekends are busy while some are not and weekdays go the same way. Be sure to ask about the military discount. Good hair cuts at affordable prices.",positive
"It was my first time going there today because I didn't like the services from Great Clips on North Durango and also was close to my house, boy it was worth it, I get uncomfortable when I go to any haircut places because of too many eyes ha anyway, I had Jessica and she was amazing, made me felt comfortable and helped me feel calm & relax by chatting with me, she did a great job with my hair and couldn't be happier.",positive
"I been going to amazing cuts since day one, Also David has been cutting my hair and my wife for years now... All of my friends are now going to see David... I love this place....",positive
"Took both my boys for simple hair cuts. Ive driven by the spot a few times and decided to try them out. Each boy went with a different stylist. The one lady was super quick and didnt clean him up or put talc to remove the cut hair off his neck. She didnt even style his hair with gel, she just basically did a poor job. As for my other boy, the lady that cut his hair was a bit more detailed, but she still managed to give the kid a crooked part line. Looks more like a thunder bolt than a part line! LOL. With that said we probably wont be going there again.",negative
I cannot speak more highly of DAVID (the owner) He is so friendly and AWESOME. I would not take my boys ANYWHERE else. He knows EXACTLY what we like. My hair is long and getting a shampoo with a trim is the best scalp massage ever. Love this place!!,positive
"I recently let a friend currently attending beauty school make an attempt at coloring my hair. It was a terrible decision and my head looked orange and horrible. David, the owner at Amazing cuts got me in right away and did a corrective color on my hair that looked AMAZING. My cut and color were both beautiful and on top of it, my hair didn't feel completely dry from bleaching it twice and I walked away a completely satisfied customer. I cant stress enough how happy I was with the results and how much fun I had at the Salon, I will call David for all of my future coloring need.",positive
"This was the best haircut I have received in Las Vegas since I moved down here last year. if you are looking for a great place to get your haircut, look no further. The staff is friendly and they do an amazing job on your hair making you comfortable the whole time.",positive
"Close to my house, super friendly owner in David and great overall customer service. Walked right in and was taken care of immediately. Special thanks to Autumn for great friendly service and an excellent haircut.",positive
"Spotted this place on a drive by a while back and figured I'd give it a shot when it was time for a trim. It is conveniently located for me and the sign on the window says ""Haircuts $9.99."" Can't beat a cut for ten bucks, right? I almost walked out when I saw how busy they were, but decided to stick it out. I put my name on the list and rolled the dice with whoever was available next, as I didn't know anything about their stylists. It actually didn't take very long to be seated and I was soon getting my do done. Granted, there is not a whole lot of complexity when it comes to my hairdo, but Pricillia did a great job. It was one of the best cuts I've had in a while. She was attentive and got through the haircut efficiently without rushing through it, with just the right amount of conversation. All of the staff members I encountered were friendly and it was a relaxed atmosphere with music playing at a modest volume in the background. Apparently they get very busy in the afternoon and on the weekend. I was told if you want to avoid the wait, you need to plan on getting there early in the day. I will definitely be back.",positive
"this place is the only place i go for my haircuts!!! i love this place and i have been loyal to amazing cuts since it opened. I would recommend to anyone. The prices are great, it is a very clean location and David the owner is really a great guy. Dont go to another chain place but instead support a small business and go to amazing cuts!!!",positive
"Beware, I went here when this location first opened since they were having a special and a friend recommended Amazing cuts since her hair dresser for years was now the owner. I had an appointment set for my sister and I, when we got there we weren't greeted until someone just yelled for us to write our names on the bored and they'll be with us in a minute. After waiting 20 minutes I went to a gentleman (go figure was the owner) and told him that I had two appointments and we were yet to be seen or at least acknowledged. He quickly apologized and said he'd be with us once he was done with his client; mind you he was doing highlights and was in the middle of it. After another 20 minutes or so waiting we decided to just leave. The next day I had mentioned to my friend the horrible service we were given and she quickly called her friend (David the owner) and he said to come in again and wed receive a discount. After being talked into it Again my sister and I went there that very night to get our hair done. Boy were dissatisfied. Let me tell you the ""owner"" of the salon still needs more training my hair wasn't cut even and the 1 highlight I wanted in my hair after washing it once turned GREEN. My sister wasn't better off she saw someone else (don't know their names were) and her hair was just as bad. My sister which before had beautiful long hair now had orange hair and about 5 inches cut off for a Trim. Mind you after we were done and both in tears they expected us to still pay for you damaged, over processed and uneven hair. This place is joke, they can't do anything right not even customer service. Since then I have known a few other people who tried Amazing cuts to only be super disappointed and to never return. Word of mouth won't get you anywhere if you can't perform the service properly.",negative
If you want to get a crappy color job for a very cheap price this is the place to go to not only are they horrific on haircuts they're professionalism is not there at all. I tried to go to the owner my highlights were spotty and uneven all they talk about are drugs cursing and going out all the girls that were good moved away and for a reason. Priscilla was the only good one for a while but she left to Sola salon. I just don't know how they stay in business.,negative
Andrea was so amazing and really worked with me to get everything I imagined for my makeup and hair a relaity for my wedding. She did an incredible job and if I could give her 10 stars I would :),positive
"Andrea was absolutely amazing! I am so happy with her work and would recommend her to anyone wanting to look great! Thanks, Andrea!",positive
Andrea is a true artist! She had great suggestions on the best makeup for my photo shoot and I was so happy! Quick to respond and confirm our appointment. Her experience and knowledge of hair and makeup is impressive! She made me look and feel young again! Thank you.,positive
"Andrea was a superstar at our 12-hour corporate shoot today. Not only did she do a superb job with making up each of our 10 models, but has a great energy and made everyone feel totally comfortable. Thank you, Andrea!",positive
"Andrea does such amazing work. She did our hair and makeup for our family photos. She arrived on time and was very professional. My mom, sister in law, and myself we're all going for different looks and she nailed each style! I would highly recommend her! Thanks Andrea!",positive
"We flew in town for a wedding. Andrea did an amazing job on hair and makeup for my sister, mother, and myself. She was punctual, easy going, and a genius in her craft. I highly recommend her!",positive
"I found Andrea on Yelp (for my wedding) and I highly recommend her for hair and makeup! She is extremely talented, professional and yet very down to earth and friendly. I couldn't have asked for better results - she did outstanding makeup/hair for myself, my four bridesmaids and my mother. We all LOVED her!",positive
Andrea is very professional from our first phone call. She quickly understood what I wanted and was very accommodating. She was on time and we had FUN!!!!,positive
"Andrea is an extremely skillful and talented makeup artist. I recently got my makeup for my wedding photoshoot, henna party, and for the brunch after the wedding by Andrea. Several guests got their makeup applied by Andrea as well. As our wedding was heavily influenced by Indian culture (clothes, jewellery, and decor for the henna night), I felt Andrea struck a fine balance in knowing exactly what makeup would work with my skin tone and my overall outfit for the occassion. I realized Andrea is very versatile. I would recommend her instantly as I appreciate her talent, her professionalism and the fact that she is very personable and warm.",positive
Andrea did my makeup and hair awhile back with I believe a 2 day notice and was absolutely amazing. I am more of a bolder type girl and she nailed it. She also did my mother-in-law who isn't much of a make up wearer but she also loved the natural look she did on her. I have a best friend with the wedding coming up and I thought of nobody else but Andrea to do our hair and make up. She made us laugh the whole time and was such a positive energy to be around. You'd have to be silly to pass that up. A super plus was when I texted her about the wedding she was nothing but helpful giving me all the information I needed as well as being totally excited to have my business again. She is certainly personable and very professional and caring. I'm very lucky to have found her.,positive
"Andrea did an amazing job with our make up. I hired her to do make up for my mom, sisters and me for my bridal shower. I have never seen my mom so pretty before. Andrea clearly has a true gift for doing make up that lasts all day long and I didn't feel like it got caked up at all!!! The other thing that I really liked was how she did our eye make up. My eyes were my favorite part.",positive
"We just love Andrea! When you find a creative artist that can make a 50-something mom and a 17 year old teen each happy with the way they look and feel, you have an amazing stylist. We've called on Andrea on several occasions and each time we have been more than thrilled. She translates what we are looking for into a natural look. We never feel heavily ""made up"" or uncomfortable. People always genuinely compliment us after we have seen Andrea. She is very accommodating and comes to our home or location of the event. She is worth every penny. We cannot say enough good stuff about our experience! We highly recommend her!",positive
"Andrea is amazing! I found her on Yelp as I was looking for a makeup artist to do my face for my birthday party. When I found out she could do my hair AND my makeup I was sold. When I told Andrea what I envisioned for my look she was totally enthusiastic and helpful. The appointment was great. We started on time and she walked me through everything that she did. My hair ended up looking great and my makeup was flawless. She made sure to ask if I was happy with the outcome and tweaked anything I wanted. While her portfolio mainly shows natural looks, she totally achieved a glam look for me and I couldn't have been happier. Totally recommend!",positive
Andrea is awesome. 10 stars! She is friendly and made this experience super enjoyable. She gave me honest feedback on the looks I picked out. Had an amazing kit. I highly recommend her!,positive
Angela is by far the best I've seen in a long time . She's classy has flair and the-sweetest heart. I walked in a mess and walked out smiling from ear to ear . Which these days is close to impossible . Bless her for making my day,positive
"Angela is the best hairstylist I have ever been to hands down! My mom and I have been going to her for many years. Even now that I live out of state, I haven't had any other stylist do my hair. She really cares about her clients, and has the skill to make your hair look however you want, from bright purple to ombré, etc.! She is a perfectionist, too, and goes above and beyond to make her clients happy. :-)",positive
The only person I trust to do my hair. She always goes above and beyond for her clients. I've been getting color and extensions from her for years,positive
"I've been going Angela for almost a year. She's a talented stylists, colorist and knows her stuff. She takes her time and doesn't rush through any part of her service. Great personality!",positive
"Angela is wonderful, she spent so much quality time on my hair and helped me to transition from one type of extensions to the other to help me obtain my personal goal of not wearing them forever. The color is perfect, the blending of my hair and extensions is perfect. She is the best beautician I have ever been to. I will never use anyone else after the tender loving care she provided to ensure the integrity of my natural hair.",positive
"Finally got a massage and it was excellent, Natalie did an excellent job. Totally relaxed and feel so much better. I had troubles finding a good place and this place is excellent .",positive
Lisa Jacob is the best. She has been my hairdresser for the last 10 years and I will follow her here to Aqua Salon! She is always responsive to my needs and is always on time.,positive
"I have been in search of a hair stylist for years! I couldn't have been happier when I stumbled upon Lisa. She is absolutely amazing! Super friendly, funny, hospital, & (most importantly) slays my hair each and every single time I always look like total a bombshell when I step out the door! I will follow her anywhere & everywhere Call 702-807-2141 to get beautified",positive
I have been coming to Lisa Jacob for ten years and she is amazing! She has saved my hair for me many times & is amazing at color & hair cuts. She also does my moms hair & my mom loves her as well. My mom is very picky about her color & only trusts Lisa to do it. I highly recommend coming to aqua salon to see Lisa. She will make your hair look amazing!!!!!!,positive
"I get my haircut by Ashley M. The haircuts are flawless. The salon is very nice and comfortable. Also they have the best esthetician in town, Teresa A. I highly recommend both of these girls. I'm 100% satisfied.",positive
"I went here awhile ago to get a facial wax done and for 40 bucks all they do are the eyebrows, Upper lip and side burns. I looked so stupid with blotches of hair all over my face i had to go buy wax and finish the job myself! A few months later I booked an appointment to get my hair dyed not realizing it was the same place but having a wedding to go to i went in. Big Mistake! Stylist was 25 minutes late for our appointment. She colored my hair ""As light"" as she could get it then just starts chopping at my hair! I tell her i did not pay or need a haircut. She said i know im just cutting your dead ends, after cutting so much I asked her to just follow the pattern of my hair and finish the cut. (I was growing my hair out but at this point she had cut so much) I KNEW she messed up the back as far as the cut because not once did she show me the back of my hair. Which is very unusual when you get your hair done. When i got home my husband and daughter were in shock because she has butchered the back of my hair!! Not to mention I still had gray hair in the front and all over the top! I paid her 170 for this!! Never again will I give this place a chance!! I wont mention her name because she was really nice but thats it.",negative
Ashley is so awesome in her craft. She loves cutting hair and makes great conversation. She is a gem in Henderson. Get a haircut by her!!!,positive
"I had originally bought a Groupon for the tanning, I loved the tanning and it was always easy to just stop by and get in to the bed I wanted. I asked the receptionist if she had any recommendations for a nail apt, and I am so glad I made that first appointment with Cory!! It has been almost a year since she started doing my nails and I would recommend her. She listened to what I wanted, we tried a couple of different options, and she ""nailed"" it. After being in Henderson for about 2 years, I was so glad to find someone that I could make an appointment with, actually listened to what I wanted and does a great job!! I would highly recommend Cory!",positive
"Chelsea did a great job on my color, highlights & cut. I have short hair which is difficult to do. Its exactly what it should look like. Nice friendly in the shop.",positive
"Christine Costa at Aqua Salon expertly takes care of my fingernails and toenails, giving me a fresh and unique look every time. She's professional, prompt and friendly, never disrepecting my time by taking phone calls, gossiping with co-workers, or speaking in another language with someone else instead of giving her focus to the customer. She doesn't proselytize, trying to sell an agenda, but instead makes this a relaxing time for me. She always confirms the appointment and it is rare that appointments have to change, but when needed, she promptly coordinates and makes it happen. I have been her customer for over 15 years, and I've followed her all over, and will keep on doing so. Give yourself a true gift and let her take care of you! You'll never go back to the nail hack shops.",positive
"I went to see Michelle after purchasing an amazon local deal for $59.00 and it included full highlights and a hair cut. When I arrived she said she was confused booking the appt and had put me down as a men's haircut and therefore she didn't have time to do my hair. I asked if she could at least cut it and I would come back for the highlights. She agreed and proceeded to rush through a shampoo and as she sat me down in the chair she said she couldn't blow dry or style my hair and so she wouldn't take my amazon deal and she would owe me a hair cut. She then cut my long and very thick hair in about 5 mins claiming that she has been cutting hair for 10 years and can do it quickly. Before I knew it, she whipped off the apron and said call me when you want to schedule your appt and then walked straight out of the room and greeted her next client. I went home thinking that her service was terrible but if the hair cut was alright then it was OK. I blow dried my hair and realized she butchered my hair and that I would have to cut at least 3 more inches off to fix it. I called the salon to speak with a manager. They took down my name and never called back. Luckily amazon gave me my money back and I will never go there again!!",negative
Andrea is my hairstylist and she is amazing! She is very attentive and does what I ask every time. It has taken me a REALLY long time to find a good hairstylist out here and I'm so happy I finally found one. If you book an appointment with Andrea you will not be disappointed!,positive
Was looking for a new salon. The customer service was great here and I loved the new color of my hair! I would definitely recommend this place to friends.,positive
"This is an amazing salon. They have friendly very qualified staff. Its is extremely spacious, and VERY clean. I recommend this salon for hair and tanning its amazing. So nice having a great local salon that I can trust with my hair.",positive
"I made a appointment for the same day while visiting Vegas. I saw some good reviews on stylists here so decided to give it a go. I asked for Kerri, Ashley or one of their best. The girl said Shelby was good had worked there a long time and done hair a long time. I got there and told Shelby I was in serious need of a mini makeover. Darken my base color add blonde highlights and give me a new hairstyle that was sassy. She said absolutely. She showed me a color chart and I picked a medium brown. I was there for over two hours and when she was done I looked exactly the way I did when I walked in. She barely trimmed some ends of my hair while the base was the about the same blonde I had. Then she added highlights that were almost same color as the base. Worst rip off I've had. $130 for nothing.",negative
Marissa Turgeon has been our stylist for a year- myself and my 2 daughters. I get highlights & haircuts and my kids get haircuts- we all love Marissa! She is friendly and never cuts too much length if we don't want her to. If we want to figure out a new style or how to keep our hair looking nice during a grow out time she gives suggestions based on our hair type and amount of time we want to spend styling.,positive
Marissa is my stylist and she does an amazing job. She is a great communicator and really listens to her clients. She is a very bright individual who is knowledgable about the ins and outs of hair styling. She regularly attends hair shows to maintain a high level of skill. I have been going to her for years and Aqua Salon treats her and the clients very well!,positive
I usually go here to tan and they are very nice with great prices so I thought id try a haircut. I don't remember the lady's name but she took an hr to cut it and then style it I was headed to work so I didn't have time to play with it much after it was until the next day that I washed it I noticed how bad the cut was I was so embarrassed to wear it simply straight because you could notice the uneven cut I had asked for a U -V cut and when I asked for a refund and showed them pictures they said they would call me back and ask the manager they ended up refunding me but the graceful tip I had left stay with the highly inexperienced stylist .by the way I had taken 4 inches off I don't even go tan there anymore because it was so disappointing pictures are in next review (red hair),negative
This was my first time to this salon yesterday. I had a Groupon and thought I'd give it a try. Ashley was my stylist. She did an amazing job. I walked out super satisfied. The salon is really pretty inside. I can't wait to try the tanning salon this summer.,positive
"Wanted to try out a new salon close to home. Groupon had $25 special that Aqua honored without having to buy a Groupon. You get what you pay for. We booked 2 appointments yesterday. I had Julia and she did a decent job on my hair. Nothing too complicated, just trim and layers cleaned up. Overall, a nice experience. My wife had Ashley and we were told that she had experience. Her haircut was a disaster. Apparently it was Ashley's first day at this salon after taking a hiatus from styling. My wife wanted to cry afterwards because her beautiful long hair was hacked up and the expensive ombre she had gotten months ago was completely chopped off. She asked for a trim of no more than 2 inches and ended up having 5.5 inches taken off. She kept reminding Ashley that she didn't want her length taken off but Ashley kept cutting anyways. She appeared out of her element and we noticed that even the more experienced stylist looked on in horror at what she was doing to my wife's hair. All the while, a very annoying and pushy man kept taking her scissors to sharpen them...IN THE MIDDLE OF A HAIRCUT?!?! Well, we learned our lesson in getting what we paid for. Never again.",negative
"Purchased a groupon for cut, full highlight and conditioning. They booked me with Shelby, so I proceeded to explain that I like my blonde highlights BLONDE not apricot, not caramel but blonde. She seemed to understand and after talking with her we agreed that I only needed partial highlights. So she went on to say that they bleach she used has a toner in it but if my blonde came out too brassy she would put more toner on it. She said that normally toner was an extra $10 but since I paid for full highlights and was only getting partial she wouldn't charge me for it. WELL, I left there extremely brassy, she didn't offer to put toner on it and I honestly don't think I got any special conditioning treatment! She is the ""professional"" so she should have realized it needed toning I shouldn't have to point it out! Live and learn!",negative
"I had a Groupon and the salon is close to my house. The Groupon price package made it worth a try. The first time the ""new"" receptionist gave me the wrong girl's name for highlights but that was straightened out. I ended up with Julia and with my pictures of the haircut, I pretty much got what I wanted. It was okay. The second time I had a pedicure and then another Groupon haircut price package. The pedicure made me have sore feet and a cut on the side of my foot. Never again on the pedicure. I had to walk 3 days on sore feet in downtown Vegas showing company in town for the week.",negative
"Had a HAIRCUT/SHAMPOO/STYLE for both myself and my 7 year old daughter by Marissa. I loved the decor of the salon and I was greeted quickly by the staff upon arriving. I went first while my daughter read her book on a massaging chair that she thought was so cool. This was the first time for my daughter to get the special treatment. Marissa was so patient with her as she kept striking poses in the mirror, very pleased with how she looked. My daughter had an Gymnastic tournament and Marissa curled and put her hair up for the event. This is the best she has ever looked since I don't know how to style hair. For me, I couldn't be happier. Marissa took time going over my current cut and making suggestions to me what she thought while listening to my requests. I am very pleased how my hair and my daughter's hair turned out. I will go back for sure.",positive
"I have been going to Horizon Sun/ Aqua Salon for about 6 years now and have NEVER found a salon in Henderson that can compare. I was born in Henderson and my mom owned a salon here as I was growing up, so I have seen my fair share of Henderson salons. Not only do they offer every service you could ever want, the staff is extremely friendly and welcoming. My hair stylist is amazing (Kerri Hunsaker, soon to be Torrez!) I would have to say my most FAVORITE service is the spray tans by Stefanie Williams. I have been a bed tanner forever and have recently been turned on to these personal spray tans. They are amazing! It is the exact, even color I have been trying to achieve for YEARS! Stefanie makes me feel comfortable during the sessions and makes it easy to book. I could go on and on for days about Aqua! Love, love, love this salon! I would recommend Aqua to everyone, and I do!!",positive
"I purchased a Groupon Now for a massage, to be redeemed before 9 PM. I called for nearly a half an hour and received a busy signal on their line. Finally the receptionist picked up and said she would call me right back. A half an hour later I called to follow up and they said that their massage therapist was not working that night. So, I basically wasted an hour of my time trying to get a hold of them based on a Groupon that they posted to generate business.",negative
"I'm not impressed with Aqua at all. Not the location. The atmosphere, the product they carry, that it's attached to a tanning salon, the people who work there. None of it! I ONLY go here & I ONLY gave it 5 stars because this is where my trusted stylist works. She was my stylist elsewhere & I moved to Phoenix for a year. When I moved back I tracked her down to Aqua. Ask for Chelsea. She's awesome!!",positive
I get my hair done by Lacey every 4 weeks and she is AMAZING! I was nervous to go to someone new since I had been going to the same stylist for most of my life. Lacey is so personable. She's very kind and sweet and her work is amazing! She cuts my hair exactly how I ask and she is very precise. We have done quite a few different things with the color of my hair and I have been absolutely in love with it every time! I also bought my boyfriend a facial and a massage for Christmas and he loved it! The prices are very reasonable and you get your money's worth. I highly recommend Aqua salon and Lacey.,positive
"I went recently for a massage that I had purchased thru Living Social or Groupon. My masseuse was very sweet but the rub was just so so. Maybe she's new to the industry and needs to hone her skills a little. I'm not really sure. I requested firmer pressure but received light pressure. My guess is that they want to up-sell you to a deep tissue which in actuality is an entirely different massage. Swedish, firm pressure shouldn't be an additional charge. Anyway, the massage was ok but not at all memorable and my muscles really didn't get worked. Beyond that, the room was freezing cold. There should be a small heater in the room and a table warmer at a minimum to ensure client comfort. A little bummed as I was hoping for more.",negative
"DO NOT GO TO THIS PLACE!!! HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE!!! I'm from San Francisco, and came to Las Vegas to spend the weekend with my mother-in-law. I decided it would be nice to take her to a salon, and have her get a facial, and I was gonna get my haircut and colored. (Bonding experience) Thinking ahead, I made the appointment about a month in advance, and was very excited to go. The day came around, and that morning I called the salon around 10:30 to confirm both of our appointments and they said we were both still scheduled for 2:00pm. So that afternoon we drove about half an hour to this place (because from the yelp reviews, it sounded the best in Henderson....boy was I wrong) and got there and they told me the girl doing the facials had a ""family emergency in California"" and they had nobody to cover. Now...when there is an emergency, isn't it the first priority to call that persons appointments for the day and let them know this?!?!? DID I RECEIVE A CALL? NOOO! When asked why they didn't call me they laughed and said they didn't have my phone number? HOW DO YOU NOT HAVE MY PHONE NUMBER? I GAVE IT TO THEM 3 TIMES!!! I can tell you what really happened, the lady that did the facials came in on a friday morning, worked until noon, and decided she didn't want to hang out any more and told the front reception to make up a good excuse for her! What really irritated me was the fact that there was 4 girls standing at the front desk, and they all laughed when I checked in. Personally, losing $300 from 2 clients isn't something I would laugh about if I worked there. Needless to say I walked out and didn't have my hair done because I was so irritated, and didn't feel like carrying on a happy conversation with the hair stylist. I'm sorry these girls didn't have what it took to make it on the strip, so they decided to become an esthetician.",negative
"I've been a client of aqua salon since they have opened. Actually had a tanning membership before they had the salon! Not only is the front desk staff the friendliest I've ever encountered, but I always walk out with a smile on my face! Shelley, my hair stylist always makes sure I am 110% satisfied when I walk out the door! The owners are friendly and it has a very family like atmosphere! I really don't understand how anyone could be unsatisfied with any service unless your just a miserable and unhappy person by nature! My girlfriend and I have had every service they provide, with the exception of the massage which I've heard from many is AMAZING and a great deal! Keep up the good work aqua! If I could give more than 5 stars I would!",positive
"Theres something to be said about old school, no nonsense barbershops...I've been searching for a good barber since I've moved back to TO in February and I think I may have found it. I came here on the recommendation of a friend and was very happy with my experience! You walk in and see two older gentleman who have been barbers for 50+yrs...check one for experience. I was a little concerned that they wouldn't be able to give me an updated cut but I was pleasantly surprised..shame on me for passing judgment. I was greeted by a very nice man - Tito who has been barbering for 50+yrs and been with the company for 13yrs - he advised me that they take CASH ONLY, which was fine with me. They only take walk ins but the wait wasn't too long - I went Saturday at around 12:15pm, and right after I walked in it started to get busy...I waited about 20mins or so, not too bad. Tito took his time to understand exactly what it was I wanted and constantly checked in with me, and also offered his opinion about certain styles. He took about 45-1hr to give me a cut and beard trim which cost me $40 + tip - about what I would pay at other hipster joints. I was considering getting a shave but he said that its an extra $12 and would take an extra 30mins or so, so I passed...considering it for next time though All in all, If you're looking for a old school, high quality cut with fantastic conversation then this is DEFINITELY the place to go!! Haircut: $28 Beard cut: $12 Shave: $12 I'll see you in a couple weeks - Thanks Tito!",positive
"I took my boyfriend here,, wanting to try out something new like downtown style .. new trend,new style. Didnt have to explain much, the stylist did an excellent job,.. me and my boyfriend were really happy and satisfied with the make over.. amazing staff and excellent service.",positive
"Probably the worst haircut I've had. Found this place on Yelp and decided to give it a try. An older Chinese lady gave me the cut. Very basic short-hair look and she couldn't complete the job without leaving an obvious uneven part seen from the front. For $27, to not even be able to get the most basic cut, is very disappointing. Not to mention that the price was just for the cut, no shampooing or styling. I might add that one of the scissors that they used even seemed dull. If there's anything nice to say, the lady was very friendly and chatty. If you do decide to visit this place, definitely try a different hair stylist.",negative
"Friendly guys and ok haircuts but they talk so much they're half as quick as someone at Terminal or other pro shops. Price is consistent with other shops downtown. Cleanliness is not the best. Feels like it's in need of a revamp and a manager to crack the whip. If you've got an hour to wait around and you like to talk a lot, maybe it's a good place. If you're busy and want a primo haircut quick, there are far better choices.",negative
"I might be biased because I really like the folks that work here. They're all very nice, genuine people that enjoy a good chat. The shop is pretty standard fare. A couple chairs to be sheared in, a couple chairs to wait in and a bunch of men's magazines. Maxim and car magazines I mean. The photos on the wall for style suggestions are priceless and go way back for a nice nostalgic kick but if you're really there for a proper barbershop cut, clean and short is the order of the day. It can get really busy at lunch time as the area is filled with offices on all sides so if you're going to go I find the best time is after the lunch rush around 1:30 or so.",positive
"I have gotten my hair cut here over the past two years and have never had a bad experience. Don't let the name fool you, this place is more 'barber shop' than 'hair stylings' (that's a good thing!) The inside is nice and there is plenty of reading material to peruse while you wait your turn (no appointments here, just first come first serve). Usually I hate making awkward small chat with the person cutting my hair, but there are two older gentlemen who work here who are a pleasure to chat with. At $21 for a hair cut this place is great. They also offer other services such as a wet shave (I have never had the pleasure of having one, maybe one day.) They are open until 6pm Monday to Friday and 5:30pm on Saturday. I would definitely recommend Aristotelis!",positive
I had an amazing body exfoliation & facial from Marissa. So relaxing from beginning to end!!! Highly recommend Marissa for services she was all around great!,positive
"The salon pricing is not worth the quality of styling. I have not gotten my hair cut there but I have gotten it styled for weddings twice. Both times my hair did not look much like the picture I showed them. Most of the other bridesmaids also said that their hair did not look like the picture they showed them. I liked the make up but I was not told the price of the fake eyelashes before they charged me for them and put them on. After they put them on I found out it was about $40 for the lashes and $15 to ""put them on""... I could have bought drug mart eyelashes for $5. My hair fell out long before the end of the day and it did not hold up for pictures. The stylists were nice and the wedding coordinator is very nice.. but I would not recommend for any wedding parties.. It just doesn't seem like the stylists are very experienced and the salon is not worth the prices.",negative
"Absolutely amazing experience! I moved to the Cleveland area a year ago from Columbus, and didn't realize there was an Aveda salon close enough to me. I had gone to another Westlake salon once last summer, and it left me unimpressed. I went to Arz, and I am so glad I found it! Lauren did an amazing job taking me from long hair to a great short hair cut! I've never gone short like this, and she kept asking my opinion and making me comfortable with it the whole time. My hair looks awesome, and everyone that's seen it loves it! Everyone at the salon was so nice, I've found my salon up here!",positive
I went here for a pedicure. It was fabulous! I was looking for a salon that did not smell of too many chemicals and this was just perfect! They use Aveda products. Salon is very well laid out. A few stations for every service. Lindsey did my nails and she did an amazing job. Very thorough and meticulous. All the staff was friendly and made for a very welcoming environment. Will definitely recommend!,positive
Went to Brianna for a Brazilian. She did the service in 30 minutes flat and it was virtually painless. Plus she's so nice and she made me feel comfortable. I definitely will go back.,positive
"I went here after moving to town off a recommendation from a friend, and I was very happy. The prices are very reasonable but it's a little far of a drive. I recommend Isabel, she does a great job and listens to what you want...",positive
"I had a wonderful day of pampering here! I got a haircut and a facial, back to back. Only down side is that it takes a lot longer than a typical appt because, after all, they are students and evaluation is part of the process. I wasn't sure if they would be giving all the complimentary treatments at the institute but they did! My stylist gave me a chair massage, hand massage and offered a mini facial. She washed my hair and gave me a choice of products to try (no up charge!). I asked to have my hair thinned and a supervisor came over to do that at the end. It was a great experience! The facial was perfect. I had asked for extractions which my esthetician did but they don't remove milia so that was disappointing (not her fault though). She offered to talk me through each step or just let me relax and I appreciated that. I opted to relax! My esthetician had a soft touch and soothing voice. I thought it might not be very relaxing because it's in a large room divided with hospital room curtains, lights dimmed and candles everywhere. With the peaceful music playing, I didn't hear anyone else even though I know there were other clients and students in the adjoining spaces. The facial started with a foot consultation (basically a foot wash) as well as an arm and chest massage during the service. It was great! Afterwards, there is a touch up bar for sunscreen, cheek color, etc. All in all, it was $75 for something that would normally be closer to $200. It did take 3.5 hours for both services. It's located in a strip mall so plenty of parking. They offer tea and water and sell their full product line. No tipping allowed.",positive
"No you're wrong. I was actually a student here. And for the most part ALLLL OF THE SHEETS were stained AFTER washing. Including the towels. ALSO! We did go 3 months without laundry detergent. That is super disgusting and unsanitary. If I could get my tuition back I would without hesitation. It's really sad how you guys cheat the ""customers""",negative
"I've been here 2x for blowouts and deep conditioning treatments . First time it was the girls first time ever doing a blowout so it took 2 hours . Second time I called And asked for a senior who would be graduating . Alex did a scalp treatment and deep conditioning and blowout . Alex did a great job and she was a natural . She was very soothing and sweet . It was so cheap too, $25 after I unlocked the Yelp 20% off . I've never had a color or cut because everyone screws up my hair when they have 10 yrs or more experience, so I would never trust a newbie . But overall I liked the Aveda school .",positive
"My facial with Evelyn was excellent. She was caring, knowledge and catered to my skins needs. I didn't even think she was a student but a professional. Thank you for making my skin glow.",positive
"I'm a few weeks late but Crystal M was amazing! I love my haircut and I got soooo many compliments! I really felt like she cared what I wanted and she did such an incredible job! I'm a super happy client, will be back again!",positive
"I would like to preface this with the fact that I emailed Aveda guest services about my negative experience, and weeks later, I've never even received a response. That being said, I had the worst possible experience during my visit a few weeks ago. I realize that the stylists on the floor are still learning, and although I have a tremendous amount of patience, I still expect a certain amount of professionalism from my student. I did not have an appointment, but was happy to get in as a walk-in. I was assigned to Mark. I wouldn't have actually known his name since he never told me, and I had just overheard it from others. From the very start, I was never offered any rituals. I explained to him what kind of cut I wanted and he said he understood. His teacher came by, and when she asked if he had given me my ritual, he said that I just wanted the haircut. Okay.... He shampooed me very roughly and many times kept stabbing me in my ears with his fingers then laughed about it. He used many curse words while talking with me, he told me all about the crazy old ladies he has to service, and kept cutting me off anytime he would ask me a question. It was very apparent that he was going to cut my hair how he wanted it, with or without my input. When he was ""finished"" and I expressed to him that it wasn't what I wanted, he continued to tell me how I needed to style it and that if I cut it the way I wanted it, I would look BAD. Excuse me? Thank heavens for the teacher who noticed how uncomfortable I was with the situation. She came over and asked him to shampoo me again and she would show him how to do the cut. I then got the roughest shampoo, yet again, and back to the chair. The teacher was very thorough, and took great consideration for what I wanted. Meanwhile, this Mark character sat next to us complaining that he had been there for 2 hours with me to his buddies. He didn't pay any attention to his teacher who was trying to help him at all. In the end, the teacher (I wish I knew what her name was), did an excellent job with my hair, and I love the cut! I wish I could have her attention-to-detail all the time. Mark decided to take a video of my hair, without even asking me, to post on his instagram, even though he didn't even cut it!!! If I can report the instagram photo, I will. I would like to say that I'll return again, but I seriously hope that issues like this are addressed. I would rather spend my money somewhere else for actual pampering and relaxation than take a chance with getting someone who clearly doesn't get it, again.",negative
This place is Sth else. I came here for a blow dry and style and they assigned me a guy to do my hair. I am very intuitive and I felt he was going to mess up my hair and I was totally right! He was extremely slow and took more than an hr to dry my hair and it turned out that it was still wet. I highly doubt that if they really teach their students here. I feel so regret to come here and maybe I was just in a very bad luck. I think their instructors need to be more responsible and teach their students what to do to their customers. No one wants to pay for bad service. It was my first time here and it's going to be my last time!,negative
"I just moved from South Pasadena, CA and wanted to advance my career and just so happen to be paying cash because my Dad agreed to pay for my schooling. I called to inquire about the Aveda program and a lady in charge(can't remember her name but I believe it was Gale or Debra?) of admission seemed very sweet so I was excited. I had an appointment scheduled and was assured that I'd be reminded. Unfortunately I got no reminder call and everything hit me all at once that day and ended up missing my appointment by mistake. When I finally remembered and called the next day, she was very curt, rude, and unhappy to talk to me. I was devastated as Aveda was my top tier choice in what school I was picking. When I asked to speak with John the owner, I got the run around and could not get to him directly. I finally gave up and am looking for another school. Super disappointed with Aveda.",negative
"I love this place ! It was my first time here and it was great . I came for a haircut, my girl was April she was great . The cut was $19... $19!!!, you get a wash a facial a massage and a style . I will definitely be back ! Next time I think I will get a color . And I found my new go to hair products !",positive
"Well having loved Aveda in the ABQ I figured I'd go to the one in Vegas. How different could it be? Surprise it was very different. I waited for my person in the lobby and then he came out ... This very tall and robust guy who was overly friendly. A queen if I ever saw one. Then he started with the touching. I don't like strangers touching me, sorry not my cup of tea. I don't know you, keep your hands to yourself. So he washed my hair and asked me a thousand questions. Finally the blow out.. I told him that my hair was not dry. He then put some cream on my head to settle down the flyaways ... Long story short .. Upon Checking out I told the front desk that my hair was not dried properly. They said they would have the teacher come out. The teacher was also very touchy! WTF? She did take me back and finished the job. But jeeze all that touching and all those questions? I'm done with this place. No thanks. And I won't even talk about the strong up sell. Yikes this place was weird with a touch of inappropriate behavior.",negative
"I come here usually every week to get my hair done, simply blowout or blowout with flat irons. Pretty clean establishment, but sometimes it can be a little chaotic. I get my hair done by Tacari who does an amazing, professional job every time. It's a very convenient place for people have busy fluctuating schedules like myself, which is why I choose Aveda. Front desk needs work and organization, so don't be surprised if your appointment isn't booked, cancelled, or incorrect. Lots of potential for this establishment, but needs apparent leadership. I will continue to come to Aveda, despite all reoccurring booking issues.",positive
"Got my hair colored. Got a massage, a mini facial and great color. All my friends tell me that my color looks so natural. Also had a great blow out. will definitely come back",positive
"My first time there today! They squeezed me in for same day appt. it was such an amazing experience! Excellent quality work very focused on quality. They offer you tea or coffee upon arrival. After that you get your hair washed and have ""rituals"" done which includes a hand massage, mini facial, neck message and hair cut with style....all for 19 bucks!!!!!!!! My student Lupe did such an awesome job with my hair and the instructor Phillip was great with teaching and making sure everything was going smoothly. Overall awesome will definetly go back!",positive
"This is my review as a student and I would give this place zero stars if I could. If you are considering going to cosmetology school in southern Nevada, you may be better off attending elsewhere. I enrolled into this school under the impression that I would be getting an amazing education for the 20K that I paid but instead, I am being taught by teachers who just graduated from this very same school about 2 years ago! I don't feel very confident that they know what they're doing. You have a handful of good instructors but the bad outweighs the good by a ton. They really do put customers ahead of you when you are also a customer--a 20K paying customer. They'll make you take customers that are flat out racist and very openly so no matter how they make you uncomfortable with the slurs they say. Not only that, they'll also make you take the extremely homophobic ones and these teachers will not defend you. They claim they are preparing you for the real world when in reality, in the real world you can deny service to such disgusting people. There are teachers that love to abuse their power, send you home early for no real reason and pull you off of your lunch break early just to service a customer because you, as a student, are not their priority. Worst of all, their are higher ups that will mess you up when you apply for a job within the Aveda network. If they don't like you? They'll tell the salon not to hire you. The teacher turnover rate here is astonishing. Several experienced highly talented ones have jumped ship. I almost forgot to mention, they will not teach you about two of the biggest money makers in the beauty industry right now: acrylic nails or extensions. They don't even teach you how to properly apply nail polish. If you're thinking about enrolling here? Run, run away, run away and never return!",negative
"Nice. Came in, got a cut, left happy. Of course, there were bumps along the way; but, for the price I was paying, I couldn't care less. Yes, their professionalism needs a little work. It can be awkward. I spent my entire washing with an armpit in my face, but hey, I got a cut I would usually pay $70 for, for only $14 w/ my UNLV discount. Most negative reviews seem to be related to ombres and other complicated cuts that I've had friends pay $200+ for a professional to screw up lmao... you get what you pay for?? I have a side cut, but it was handled very well. My side cut length is actually the best I've had. Impressed. Already scheduled my next appointment!",positive
"Based upon first-hand experience, I'm giving this institute 5 stars. I lived and worked in a paid, Federal internship at NAFB in Las Vegas for 6 mos in 2013, and got my brows and color done at this institute. Keeping in mind that this is a school and it will take a long time for the service, I was always really happy with my appointments. I was happy with the customer service and skill set of the students. The students asked questions of me, and that's a GOOD SIGN. They asked ME about MY formula and I was able to explain that I'd had this same formula for yearssss, so it was safe to use. They questioned why 30 vol was used on a natural blonde (me), which is not a typical formulation for blond hair, and I explained that in my case my hair could handle the 30 vol as long as it didn't overlap. This is in stark contrast to an experience I had with Aveda institute Phoenix's Aveda certified Educator, Team Lead, and Color Specialist, Angie Perino Nelson. My advice is to discuss at length with the student and Educator what you do and don't want so that you're all on the same page. Don't hesitate to write down your thoughts, bring in photos and a ruler! If you don't already have an Aveda formula to give them then have them write down the one they used for you so you can have consistency from visit to visit.",positive
"The ONLY reason I'm giving 4 stars rather than 5 is bc it did take quite some time for my partial highlights and hair cut to be complete but I was waited on right away, I received a mini facial and relaxing mini massage. The student was very good about making sure she understood exactly what I wanted and she did an awesome job!!!!!!!! I honestly couldn't have gotten better color or a better cut anywhere! I am super picky and have very straight fine hair so any mistake is very noticeable! My hair looks great and the service was beyond reasonably priced! This is def my new go to! Just make sure you don't mind spending a good portion of your day/morning there if you're also getting color!",positive
"Love this place for a huge price savings!! Misty was awesome, she listened and did her best and I honestly got better service and treatment there than Kelly Cardenas Salon who charges an arm and a leg for exactly what these students can achieve. I had a Highlight and a Blowdry with style service and it was GREAT!! Highly recommend to anyone who wants to save a HUGE amount of money. The BEST $40 I have ever spent on my hair!! I will never go to another salon again. Aveda Institute is my go to salon from now on :) :)",positive
I have been here twice for haircuts. Both times left me feeling confident and refreshed! Mandi is amazing and so is Kim (an instructor). Can't beat the price or the customer service!,positive
I had a Groupon for a cut & partial highlights. The student & instructors did a great job. I have hard to cut hair and not only did the color come out exactly how I wanted it but the cut was one of the best I've ever had in Vegas. I'll be back as a regular (non-Groupon) customer for sure!,positive
"I don't recommend this place at all. Not only was I skipped by another customer. But the manager only had to say that I had no choice to wait, since many stylists had called in. Don't punish the consumer because you don't know the basics on running a business. Or at least, acknowledge the mistake by offering a discount or free products. Is it that difficult to at least be politely or courteous to another person?",negative
"I have been going here for about 3 years. Most of the visits were good ones. Along with that, 2 bad ones, a few awesome ones and a few so-so ones. That's not a bad risk. This is a school and each student is a different person. Some are more talented than others. Great prices for the services you will get.",positive
"I bought the groupon and i didn't know they were students, I was scared for a little bit but I really liked this place. I went with my friend, she had massage and pedicure and she really liked. I had highlights and a hair cut. My student was 15 days for her graduation and she was really nice. I like the color of my hair very much but I ended up still having gray hair, I should have told her that was a big concern for me and I would like to color and hide them, but it was fine. Overall they try to help the costumers, just make sure you are very clear about what you want.",negative
"I went in to get my highlights updated and my over all color. I booked an appt on FB then drove down there and the students were doing their ""mods"". I was kinda upset telling the receptionist that they should block their days out so no on can book appts on the days the students would not be available for service. No brainier right? So she tells me to come in the next day right when they open and they will be able to do my hair. Arrived at 9 Am and got out of there at 1:30 i had a meeting to make at 2 and the student did a great job of keeping tract of time. I printed off a coupon for a free botanical treatment and when i went to pay they said since they are a school they dont accept coupons. Why not print that at the bottom? NOT ACCEPTED AT OUR SCHOOL? I wasnt too happy with that or the fact the woman at the register gave me a total without really explaining my bill to me. $80.00 My hair was still fabulous! Thats why i go back. Not really for the customer service.",negative
"Got my highlights done here. My hair dresser was very nice, and did a great job on my hair. The prices are amazing for the service they offer. She also straightened my hair at the end. She was very patient, considering I have thick curly hair. I think she just hated me a little at the end, since my hair was so hard to work on. Still, not my fault and hopefully this was a good learning experience for her.",positive
"I am new Vegas but not new to the Aveda Institute. I have been going to the one in Tempe for years and never had an issue. My stylist was in a mood and was fired or dismissed right during my color, sat for another 45 min waiting for another student to finish when my scalp started burning. New stylist informs me I have ""hot roots"" which she preceeded to fix, nightmare is an understatement. Supervisor was rude, charged me the full price of not only service 1 but the repair of the mess that stylist 1 did to my hair. I was there a total of 6.5 hours and was never offered a drink or an apology plus had to pay for orignial service plus repair service. I wrote to the owner and never heard a peep.....not worth the price folks!",negative
"I knew about this Institute, thanks to groupons, I got a haircut, very pleased and satisfied with my look, the point is you have to be patient and tell the student exactly what you want, the instructor will also come and finish the final job I paid 15$ for a very nice hair cut, I used to pay 60$ to have the same look, but now only 15$ with hand massage and facial treatment, No tip is accepted at school, thanks to Aveda, and thanks to LAs Vegas Updated on Jan 05, 2011 : Okay, I got a lots of compliments about my hairstyle, girls love it, guys love it :), so TOTALLY WORTH IT :)",positive
"I had the following services done today: -brow and lash tinting: Results were great. The service student was very nice -haircut and makeup: the student who did my hair had only 3 weeks until graduation...Thank GOD! She did a good job, consistently ask me if I like it. She was like a pro with another pro checking her work. When she did my makeup, she was very nice and made sure that my makeup was to my liking. She did exactly what I asked of her. In addition to the haircut, I got a nice little scalp and shoulder massage, a mini facial and hands massage, which were definitely good. My poor bf, however got a new student, in which it seems to be her first time cutting a real person's hair. He didn't get all the perks that I did. He also told me that she took FOREVER. The person you get to cut your hair is like the luck of the draw. I had an awesome experience, all for $45, while my bf vowed to never come back. Poor him. But, I will definitely come back.",positive
"Sure, it's cheap. But how much is your head of hair worth? I had the world's worst experience there and warn everyone not to go, especially at day's end when the students are distracted. I had a student who was almost done with her training. That scared me - she should not be allowed to cut hair. If she is so bad, imagine the new students. All she did was bitch to her friends instead of acknowledging my existence, let alone pay attention. She did tell me the instructors were all people who couldn't get salon jobs. That explains a lot, including why the instructor cut my bangs so short that I look like I just got out of an insane asylum. I would have had better luck with a monkey cutting my hair with a kitchen knife.",negative
"My friends and I decided to go to Aveda, since one of our classmates recommended it (and she always had nice hair). She mentioned that the haircuts were cheap too, only $15! When I arrived there, I was greeted by one of the junior students. She was very friendly, and would explain everything that she was doing. She also explained about each fabulous AVEDA product that she used on me. What's nice about the haircuts are that there are a lot of COMPLIMENTARY services included in that $15. First, they give you a stress relieving scalp treatment (you can choose from 3 different scents like energizing, calming, and beautiful. I chose CALM because it had a lighter scent). After that, they shampoo and condition your hair. During the conditioning process, the student would ask if I wanted a mini facial (complimentary!), and a hand/arm massage (complimentary too!). If you were wearing makeup, they would even offer a comp make-up touch-up. The students here get about 11 weeks training to do hair, and are later allowed to take clients. They each get about 2 clients a day. Most of the students are only there for about a year (Tuition is like $17K a year for them!). Make sure you get at least a junior or senior. You don't want to be getting your hair messed up! There are usually about 4 instructors on the floor, so many of the students would have to ask their instructors for some tips or advice when they encounter certain dilemmas. Don't worry! These instructors are very experienced, and make sure the students won't destroy your hair! No tipping is allowed here. However, when you buy any Aveda products, it goes to the stylist/haircutter (especially if you really wanted to tip). All of the students took their time with my friends and me (We were there for about 2 hours+!) Please be patient if you have one of the students who is VERY careful. The students were very responsive and friendly. I would definitely come back here again for my stylist to do some coloring/highlighting or even perms. They also offer Esthetics, which include relaxation packages (oil massages), stress reliever packages, exfoliating back facials, pure focus facials, and awakening wraps! Maybe a wrap in the near future?",positive
"I love the level of professionalism at this place, I was greeted promptly as I walked in and received my service really quickly. The staff is super knowledgeable and goes the extra mile ensure that you have a comfortable and relaxing experience. I got balayage done as well as a deep conditioning treatment by Paula, and she really took her time to make sure that I got the results that I wanted. She also took the time to answer all of my questions. I would definitely get my hair done here again!",positive
"I have to admit I'm a sucker for Groupons, especially for things I need such as post summer mani-pedi! 4.5/5 if I could give a 1/2 star. This place has a new owner apparently thus the Groupon and I had to book 2 weeks in advance! As they were accommodating new and existing customers which is understandable. Plus the Groupon deal was fantastic so I wasn't going to complain about waiting plus they're open late at least 2 nights a week. Ambience: nice, lots of white, quite a large place as they offer hair services, waxing, and soon o offer laser hair removal as well. The pedicure stations (two of them) are in the middle, closer to the back and separated from the from by a floor to ceiling wall. They don't have massage chairs but given that those are cess pools (of bacteria), I was relieved to see a pleather bench. The esthetician was very experienced and well groomed with lovely shellac manicure. She was very pleasant and chatty. I was getting a standard mani-pedi and they had the usual selection of Essie, OPI, etc nail polishes. Half empty bottles I might add. Deduct 1/4 of a star for that. Although perhaps I should bring my own polish. She had to put 4 coats on my toes in order for the colour to be as vibrant as it looked in the bottle. God bless her patience! I was happy with the end result. It didn't feel rushed and we had a nice chat (myself and the esthetician). And she was ready to take me as soon as I got there. She offered me tea, coffee, or water which I declined but was a lovely touch! I was happy with my pedicure and she did a good job on my heels which are in rough shape (no pun intended). I deducted another 1/4 of a star because the clear coat on my finger nails (I don't like colour on my finger nails) was peeling off the next day. I didn't notice what brand it was. I understand that we wash our hands a lot but I've never had a top coat/clear coat just peel off like that. Bonus: they give you your Emory board and bugging square, if you want it, for hygiene reasons. That's always a good sign. Given that I had the pedi first and then had to walk over to mani station in fabric open toe slippers they provided, my toes has plenty of time to dry :-) I neglected to ask they're regular rates but imagine that they are posted on their website. It's now 1-week post visit to salon and my pedicure still looks great (like I just had it done). And my mani, well, most of the clear coat is gone unfortunately. Some of my hang nails are back but that's no fault of this salon as this tends to happen to me one-week post manicure. As for colour selection....I wish there has been more colours. It felt a bit limited. Or bring your own if you're selective or want to be able to do touch ups at home. Would I come back? Yes! Would I recommend to a friend who lives in the area or drives by there? Yes! (I wouldn't go out of your way as there are comparable nail salons all across the GTA ;))",positive
Amazing haircut by Mary Grace. Everyone there was super friendly and accomodating. I reached 10 mins late for my appointment and wanted to leave early (basically i was being a difficult customer) but Mary got onto it and I was out in 50 mins :) and she dint compromise on the service.. My hair looks great and She gave me some good suggestions on how to keep it healthy.. Would recommend it to all :),positive
"A facial by Sharon was a delight! It surpassed my expectations. What I really liked, was that she was willing to teach me much more about skin care. So I left looking great, but also empowered by some simple changes that I could make to my daily routine. I am giving Sharon a 5 star review, because it was the best facial I've ever had and it was a pleasure to be in her company!",positive
"Argh, I thought I had submitted my updated review back in July! Okay, so after my horrible experience of trying to use the Buytopia voucher to no avail after it had expired - as per my first review, I had received horrible service when I tried to use the $29 towards other services like you would with a Groupon. Several months later I was contacted by the owner with an apology and an invitation to return, and with a promise that they would honor my voucher. I was still pretty pissed off over the whole drama, so I hesitated for over a month - and finally I decided to give them a call. I was impressed by how willing and adamant they were to try to fix the situation and ""make it up to me."" I really did not want anything beyond what I had purchased, and would have been more than happy to just use the $29 towards a service and not get the actual deal I had purchased. I knew I had let the deal expire and wanted to own up to that. But they were persistent about giving me the deal. So I went in and got a mani-pedi (shellac for my nails and regular polish for my toes). The service was friendly, efficient, and I was very happy with the results. The only reason I am not giving the experience 5 stars is because the shellac did not last as long as I am used to, but then again, I may have been washing and using my hands more than usual. Who knows. But also, when I got to the salon and told them what I was there to get, they did not believe me when I told them that I was there for a mani-pedi and it could be shellac for both (the deal I has purchased was for a shellac mani-pedi - though I was happy to settle for regular polish for my feet). Apparently the deal I had was an old one (they could not remember it), and the one they most recently offered was for a regular mani-pedi with a massage. But once I showed them a copy of the deal, all was well. Overall, I am impressed by a business that is willing and adamant to make a customer happy. Too often businesses don't want to bother with one person that had a bad experience or that was unhappy for not getting their way. But this certainly was not the case here. Thank you for turning a frustrating experience to a positive one!",positive
"Would Definitely recommend this place. I got a mani pedi, massage and facial. Great service and wonderful staff. Inside was very clean and days later my face is still silky soft.",positive
"I found the prices reasonable compared to salons in the area, but the quality is superior . . I always go to Paul Mitchell salons and I'm happy to have one in my area without having to pay downtown prices. I've never left there without an amazing experience.",positive
"Never going back!!!! Mind you, my hair turned out amazing, they charged me $300!!!!!!!!!! For not a full set of highlights, but a half set. Along with a cut and style. Never in this city have I paid more than $200 for that same request, and with the same product they used!!! Furious with myself for accepting to pay for this, but even more furious that they think it's okay to spend 3+ hours on your hair and charge you that outrageous amount. (bye bye groceries for the next month or two)",negative
Moving here from Texas and leaving my hairdresser of 18 years was hard. I totally lucked out finding Michelle. She is a master at hair coloring and styling as well. Her shop is private and decorated so well. Also she's like talking to your best girlfriend! Can't recommend Blondies enough!!!,positive
"I've been nervous to leave Michelle a review for fear more people will find this hidden gem! Well, not so hidden anymore. She's right in the heart of old town, and is an absolute color expert. I've gotten to the point where I don't even have a plan before I get there, but instead just tell her what I'm feeling or what I'm ""going for"". I've been super dark brunette, ombre, beachy blonde...you name it. And each time I've loved it more than the last. She'll play fun movies to watch and lounge while you're getting pampered and is always super entertaining. She's become a great friend (probably just by being a great listener), and couldn't say enough great things about her work! PS, have her style your hair before a big event. It's the bomb.com.",positive
Michelle is the greatest! She does an excellent job with my blonde highlights. I love getting my hair done by her she is very personable and makes the experience comfortable and fun.,positive
Been going to MICHELLE for about 7 years. Nothing but spectacular can describe her artistry .. Hair color and brows she is a true master.,positive
I cannot tell you how AMAZING my hair looks now. I was a dark brunette with lots of color in my hair and she was able to pull out all my color in one session and make me a wonderful platinum blonde. I highly recommend this salon! 5 stars all the way! I've never loved my hair more.,positive
"This is a really neat salon center with many tiny one-room salons. Michelle got her hands on my fiancée's hair for our wedding and she did a great job in making her blonder (and I mean that as far as color goes, not intelligence). Meanwhile I was languishing for 2 1/2 hours, so thank you Mark Zuckerberg for your social networking site.",positive
"Michelle at The Color Room is a miracle worker, and an amazing stylist. She transformed my brown hair into a beautiful blonde, and was such a professional about everything. We had a 20 minute consultation about what to do, how we were going to do it (and by we I mean her). She completely understood what I was looking for, and was a great listener. Overall the whole color, cut, thinning out process (I have extremely thick hair) took a little under 4 hours, and Michelle never once seemed tired or annoyed that I was there for so long. I even offered for her to just blow dry my hair but not style it if things would take too long, but she refused to let me leave without looking anything but fabulous, even if was almost 10pm at night. I am in LOVE with my color, the cut looks great, the layers make my hair fall really well, and I had a great time chatting with Michelle the whole time. By far the best hair experience I have ever encountered in regards to color, pricing, and everything in between. I will be a regular from now on.",positive
"Wanting to go with something different and more professional for the holidays than the local Great Clips I was recommended by a few friends to go to Michelle at the Color Room. I was definitely impressed. Great little location in Old Town amongst a whole bunch of other beauty and hair related businesses in the Total Image Beauty Mall. Michelle was very friendly, professional, and a good listener which I find important in a stylist. I thought she did a great job with my hair and I will definitely be returning. My (girl)friends get their hair colored and cut here and it always comes out great. Prices were reasonable and I came out with a great look.",positive
Hair cut was great. Salon is really professional looking and pleasant. Michelle listened to what I wanted and accomplished the result I was going for. Good job,positive
I can see where other reviewers thought staff was a bit on the stuffy side. I got a great haircut! I found the place a little lacking in warmth or friendliness. Felt a little like an outsider as opposed to a valued client whom they wanted to know better.,negative
"I went to have a haircut and color with Sarah on Tuesday and I couldn't be happier! Not only was the salon accommodating with an appointment at 6 pm, but the level of professionalism and expertise by the stylist was very clear. The salon was very clean and welcoming and I will continue to make the hour long drive from Mesa just to know I am going to get a great haircut and color.",positive
Shanelle is great! I had a haircut I wasn't happy with and she fixed it for me while I wait until it grows out. Plus she did fabulous color on me! I would definitely recommend her to anyone! Ask for Shanelle!!,positive
I have had Shanelle Hill as my stylist for 2 years. I had tried several salons since moving here 5 yrs ago. Finally I found a great stylist who actually listens to what I want concerning my hair cut .style etc. Shanelle cares about what the client wants.I have had many compliments and questions about who my stylist is..I was so fortunate to have found Shanelle and have recommended her to many acquaintance s.,positive
"I've known a lot of these girls for years and they are most definitely the most talented hairstylists I have worked with and had my hair done by. Beth is my hairstylist and my sisters and she is amazing. Tara, Alia, Patti, and Shanelle are all great hairstylists and have all at one point done my hair. I did hair for over 10 years and I know what to look for, and I trust all of them. Aveda is gentle, and a great product line.",positive
"I not sure what to say. I should have read the yelp reviews first. So disappointed right now. I've been growing my hair for almost a half a year. I requested someone with experience. The girl said oh this girl has over 12 years exp so today I go to get my hair cut with my daughter and I got the worst hair cut ever. I ask Kristen how old she is. ""21"" she said. Okay so she has been doing hair since she was what 9? I was so mad I couldn't even say anything. We should have had my 15 yr old cut our hair and saved $80.00. We both felt like we just went to a chop shop. These girls need to learn how to cut hair and how to treat customers.",negative
"I have been going here for the past few months and seeing Amber for brow waxing. She is a lovely woman and typically does a fabulous job on my brows, and that's saying something because I'm extremely picky. This last time I saw her, it seemed like she might have forgotten what I typically like my brows to be because she ""notched"" one of them which I can't stand. The other problem I have had, is that the receptionist is ultra snobby and rude. She looks down on everyone that seems to comes through the door. She is very unpleasant to deal with on any level...like by making an appointment I seem to be wasting HER time? Get real. She made me an appointment for 11am. I got there at 10:50 am. she gave me an attitude because I was early. Really? Not sure if I will continue to go. Most likely, I will be taking my business elsewhere",negative
"I will never return again. You lost a customer. This would have been my 4th visit to the salon. After trying all weekend to make an appointment for my mother and self I finally got a call Tuesday morning 12/10 the day I wanted my appointment. Made the appointment for 1 and the receptionist said she would have her other girl shanell come in early so we could both have a stylist. Upon arrival shanell sat me down and asked me what I wanted done. When I started to explain the color I wanted she said ""whoa whoa I thought you just wanted a cut. Hold on"" she went to the front (where my mother was waiting to be called back) and checked what the receptionist wrote, then my mother heard the receptionist say that I had told her I only wanted a cut. LIAR. Then shanell went to the back and started complaining to whoever was in the back and after a few minutes finally came back to me. She said ""I can color your hair, maybe cut it, but I don't have time for anything else so you can just sit under the dryer. I came in early to help you out and I just don't have time"" we decided against it and left. Clearly your employees mistakes are my fault and I should feel bad for her having to come in early? No thanks I'll take our business elsewhere.",negative
"I bought a groupon online I liked my haircut but the whole experience was just okay. My stylist who never introduced herself to me, she wasn't personal or friendly and said barely 10 words the whole 45 min I was there. I won't be back.",negative
"I bought a Groupon for this place because my regular hairstylist's dad was real sick. I was ten minutes late for my appointment which I called to give them a heads up about. When I got there the receptionist said the stylist had just run to Starbucks. When she walked in, she said, ""Is this it?"" (Meaning her appointment) and the receptionist said yes. First of all, THIS??? Is this it? Um, I'm a human being thanks. Then, she never introduced herself, I still don't know her name, and she wasn't very chatty at all like I'm used to hairstylists usually being. She made it sound like my ten minutes was a HUGE inconvenience for her. I finally had to break the ice and start talking to her which she did talk to me, but still didn't really engage. The salon itself is really nice. Their hair washing stations are super comfortable and don't hurt your neck at all. Oh but did I mention she washed my hair with cold water? Brr!! I won't go back.",negative
"I really hate to tell everyone how awesome Tara is at Botanicals. When I first started seeing her, I could get appointments in a day or two. Sometimes even the same day. Now she's become so popular that it takes a week or more to get to see her. Totally worth it. I trust her with my hair. I can tell her my vision and she sees it. I've never gotten a bad cut from her. In fact, now I just tell her to do her thing and she knows what to do. I've started taking my daughter with me as well. It's $15 for a kid's cut and that includes the awesome shampoo/massage with the lavender shampoo. My princess is spoiled. My daughter has an asymmetrical bob with choppy sides. Very fashion forward. Others have totally failed to do it right, but Tara rocks it out every time. I don't know about the other people at Botanicals, but Tara is, hands down, amazing!",positive
"I have never had a worst experience getting my hair done. I actually cried! I have short blonde hair that I asked for the roots to be touched up and toned to be a nice beige-y blonde. Not something anyone has ever been confused about before. I come out looking like a lemon-frosted cupcake! Absolutely awful! I asked for it to be toned down...my stylist and another looked at me so confused and had NO clue what to do. Then they said they'd fix it. OMG...it was worse! It was orange AND muddy looking!? I was again very disappointed and feeling defeated at this point...they were blaming MY hair. Then the owner comes over with an attitude acting like I didn't tell them what I wanted. So I had to pull out old pictures of myself just to show what my hair SHOULD look like. After over 5 (yes 5!) hours of this I left with dark hair and steaks of blonde (which i expressed several times that i didnt want streajs)...i left with a wet head. PLUS they charged me for everything!!! I didn't even know how bad it was till I got home. It looks grey-ish and muddy! I went from a vibrant blonde to muddy, old looking hair. The cut was horrible, too. This is an Aveda concept salon. I would expect higher quality! I called today to speak with the manager or owner and the receptionist was rude (like every time I've called) and basically told me someone will call when they get around to it. I have no idea how much this will vist me to fix. I'm devastated.",negative
"Worst Owner/Manager, terrible receptionist. Don't ever buy a gift certificate, difficult to use, improper handling of appointments, rude receptionist and owner.",negative
"Absolutely the worse highlights & haircut EVER. The front of my hair was totally blonde, the ""highlights"" went down to my ear on the left side, stopped at the crown on the left side & stopped midcrown in the back. When the stylist (Kristin) said she would cut 2"" off I thought she meant she would only cut off 2"" - my hair is now 2"" long - she did not clean the back of the neck & left the nape long. After going home & crying I paid another stylist to totally recolor my hair & trim the back evenly. The cost is outrageous at Botanicals - I would NEVER, NEVER, NEVER GO BACK THERE. PS: the receptionist is snotty",negative
I've been coming here for 3 years and I love it!!! Beth is absolutely amazing and no matter what she does I walk out smiling. Katie and Alia are also good. The staff has always been super sweet to me and I've never had any problems. Thanks for everything Beth!!!,positive
"I am new to the area, and was looking for a new stylist for my daughter and I. I chose this place because of the location and that it wasn't a run down old place like some of them in Surprise. My stylist\colorist was very nice and talkative, but in the end she was rushing through cutting and stylingbecause her next client was waiting. Very disappointed! I am a paying customer! My daughter had the most unlikable stylist! She said 5 words to her the whole time, blow dried it with no style! Wow and the receptionist checking us out, was even more unlikable, no smile no thank you! We will never go back and I will give this business bad press as much as possible!",negative
"This is the third time I've been here and certainly the last. I had a spa pedicure and the nail tech didn't say 5 words to me the entire time I was in the chair. It was extremely uncomfortable as I felt like I was imposing on her time by being a paying customer. My nails didn't turn out any better than if I'd done them myself. I do get regular pedicures at a more expensive salon/spa but thought I would try Botanicals again since they are closer and less expensive. I guess you get what you pay for. When I was finished and she led me to the counter she said ""nice meeting you"" while looking distantly out the window. It couldn't have been more impersonal. Then I was checked out by some teen eating her drive-thru breakfast. Appalling. Will not return ever. Also, before I wrote this review I left a message for the manager to call me so I may discuss this. I never received a call.",negative
"I got a groupon here, and I got services with Amy and I liked the job she did so much that I became a regular customer. I really think they are reasonably priced, and I also love Aveda anyway so I always come here now! Great to find a nice salon when you are new in town.",positive
"My father had purchased groupons for my mom and me to use here. When I called them in, it turns out that by select stylists they meant two. Just two. I was hesitate about this one especially since they wanted new clients only. It seemed like a desperate attempt to try to drum up business. Not that all salons on groupons are like that. In DC I've seen some very good salons just trying to attract more clients while catering to their base. The receptionist on the phone was not friendly about it and they refused to be accommodating. The price of color isn't that high but due to their customer service, I wouldn't care if they happened to be the best stylists in the Phoenix area, I still wouldn't go to them. I have an appointment set up with someone who costs more but both she and the salon were friendly and very accommodating. Based on customer service I would not recommend this salon. Two stylists for something that would bring in as many customers such as Groupon is unintelligent as a business move. This obviously leaves disgruntled clients. For anyone else with a groupon, we were able to get our money back because Groupon agreed that this behavior was wrong.",negative

"Once again Butter worked their magic! After getting my hair literally hacked off at Distilled Beauty Bar, I didn't think Butter could do anything with it for my annual Christmas party. Trust me...I warned them when I made the appointment. They allowed for extra time and assigned me to Sara She was a bit shocked at the cut I received a couple months ago. We discussed and looked at a few pics on the iPad. After looking at my outfit and getting a feel for what will work, she went to work. She nailed it with a messy, sexy, updo with a couple of fishtail braids and a low, off to the side knot!!! It looked fab with the shape of my face, it hid the hack job perfectly. Most importantly, I felt amazing! Let's not forget to give a shout out to Karla! She's been doing my makeup for my Christmas party or any occasion for the last four years! She makes me looks gorgeous! If I want to do something different, she does her all to deliver. If its too cray, cray, she'll tell you no...but a polite no. I'm self-conscious about my eyelids...again she enhances and beautifies what I think are my flaws. Butter Beauty is a definite go to for any occasion! Not only for the price, but for amazing artists who definitely listen and take care of you!",positive
"Karla is amazing! If you're looking for perfect brows, she is your girl. Not only is she so talented at brow shaping, she is also an all around wonderful person and I look forward to my appointments with her.",positive
"I'm extremely impressed with Butter! Sitting here drying after my pedicure as I speak. My esthetician Anna was phenomenal. You can tell she loves what she is doing and is very experienced, I've never been happier with a pedicure. Kelsey did my blowout, great conversation and my usually flat, limp hair looks voluminous and fresh. Will be returning!",positive
"I absolutely love Butter. Just had the most amazing pain free Brazilian from Robyn, she is awesome I would highly recommend anybody to her especially those who dread getting waxed as I do, Robyn is my go to girl. Pain free, quick and really clean. I will defiantly be back for my wax again.",positive
"I am very disappointed with Butter.I went there for trial run prior to my son's wedding, well it turned out to be 5 tries and 3 stylists later and still my hair was a mess. I showed them pictures and everything was yes we can do that, but no they could not.I have very long and curly hair, when they put product in it ( a lot of product ) my hair did not last.I was told by the first stylist that the back looked great, yes it did for the hour, but I told her pictures are taken from the front. The price was reasonable for the first 3 tries ( $38.95) and yes I had to pay for all even though they could not style my hair. The day before the wedding they charged a fortune ($ 110.00 ) and the day off the wedding the price was crazy ($ 210.00). The day of the wedding the whole wedding party was there (that is the only reason I went )and at the end my hair was taking soooo long to do that my bride to be had to finish it.. What a shame that these people do not take more styling classes to deal with all kind of hair types. My stylist told me the bangs were to long and she did not have scissors to cut them, I did not want them cut just styled. No one there was able to offer any help, they certainly do not work as a team and help each other out. My make up girl was very good!",negative
"My new go to nail salon. All of the staff are always welcoming and friendly. Love being offered a tea, coffee or pop each time I arrive, and love the modern decor. Robyn dies an amazing job every time!",positive

"Just had my first wax at Butter salon. I really liked the look of the place so was excited to go. The first receptionist I met was great really warm welcome, and the girl who did my service, Zoe was friendly. I explained to her what I wanted, which is a specific and small area, basicly under crotch and behind! she did it okay, Ive had better. It was more painful than most other times ive had it done and felt longer. although I like shabby chic the treatment room was dirty. like it hadnt been cleaned overnight. There were random eyelash extensions everywhere on the towels and sheets which I could forgive in a lower priced place at the end of a busy day. the sheet she on the bed had loads of stains on it, one looked like a coffee ring?. Its just wasn't clean enough. Afterwards my friend decided to get an eyebrow wax, the same girl did it . Again she was great to talk to but she didn't do a very thorough job, afterwards we noticed alot of random hairs which should have been tweezed. It looked a bit half finished. He recieved $10 off for my referring him, and thats good because he paid $11, which befits the level of service he recieved. Full price is $21. I was charged a for a bikini wax which I never actually had, my esthetician told the receptionist that I did not have a proper wax, just a small area and the second receptionist said thats the price for a bikini wax. I thought she would have offered me the $16 miscellanous wax (which is printed on the price list) but she didn't. She had a bit of an attitude when I asked her about it too. Overall I'd say I was dissapointed with my negative experience. I think this place looks great, but its a little style over substance. I could have been over charged someplace else, with slightly less dressy surroundings and still have left happier.",negative
"I had a great first experience at Butter Beauty Parlour. A very fun afternoon of pampering! I had a gel gloss pedicure and my hair styled. The pedicure has lasted for almost a month and I'm very happy with it. I'm pretty particular about how my hair is styled - the stylist did a good job, but I felt put too many products in my hair. It's very thick, so if it's weighed down with product, the style will fall out...which it did and I had to fix at home. I enjoyed the pedicure so much that I've already booked a spa afternoon with co-workers. With the 5 pedicure stations and 4 manicure stations, it's a great place to book a girls' day for a birthday party, stagette, or just because!",positive
"Wow. I love Butter! Tessa is my go-to-girl for all my hair wants, needs, and dreams. Not only is she a hair magician in creating exactly what I want, but also an amazing teacher with helping me recreate my look. I get more product knowledge from that girl than I know what to do with! Im already looking forward to my next visit, see you soon girls!",positive
"This place is great. Efficient and well-priced, I will be going back! It feels clean and trendy, and I was quite happy with my services. They sell lovely products - Bumble and Bumble hair care (no shock as Hedkandi owns Butter), and a few other lines including lovely candles that I was quite tempted by (next time!). Like Hedkandi, Butter offers online booking, which I love. The place is a little bit hard to find - it shares the building with WURST, and they don't yet have their signage up!",positive
"I am beyond amazed with how my hair turned out! I definitely needed to do something. My hair before was dull and lifeless, and was in desperate need of a trim. Joey brought it back to life! I got some highlights and a trim. My hair is completely transformed! I love my new hair so much. Just in time for new years too! If you are looking for a new look or even looking to get your hair done for a New Year's Eve party, ask for Joseph Volpe! Thank you so much Joey!",positive
I just went in off a Groupon and Arend was outstanding.. I had all over color done and a haircut.. He advised me accordingly and my hair turned out the way I wanted.. I highly recommend this salon.,positive
"Had my hair done by joseph v. Amazing ! I did a red ombre with cut and hit it on the spot. he styled it for a couple minutes in the end it turned out sooo beautifully. I had so many compliments already ! Best part, during the whole process, he took his time which I appreciate even though he had another client waiting. (Which the other client didnt even mind waiting because thats how good he is) thanks !",positive
Love the atmosphere here. Friendly staff and very clean! I've had my hair done by Nasana and Tina they are both great. I also love the Njoy(spellcheck?) products Nasana uses in my hair. My hair always comes out so healthy looking and soft.,positive
"Yelp has never let me down, until now. Haircut by Larry. Very personable..unfortunately, WORST haircut in my life. I always ask new stylists if they know how to cut bangs as I have pretty heavy bangs similar to Zooey Deschanel and it seems to be rocket science to cut them correctly. He said it would not be a problem. I even showed a photo. I told him the last guy that trimmed my bangs did a terrible job and foreshadowing: whenever I said I didnt like something he did, he blamed it on the last guy. Anyway, here you go: At first he took off a tiny amount to the point where my bangs were the same length as when I walked in. Told him to cut it shorter which he did but the triangular shape was not there. I described to him how my hairstylist (who unfortunately moved out of town) would frame them and then cut. He did not understand. I needed them to flow into the rest of my hair, almost like a wide upside down U. So my already thin hair was then cut like a ""sex kitten"" as he put it where he glided the scissors down my hair to create a weird layer which will just end up looking like a bunch of flyaway strands. I told him I didn't like it and I am assuming that was end beginning of the end, he CUT the hair off. I didn't realize he bluntly chopped off hair that was not part of my bangs (see picture). SO pissed. Had I noticed this, I would not have tipped. Learned my lesson. Enough with the bangs. I told him I wanted about 1-2 inches off cut totally straight as my hair reached mid back. My request turned into him cutting it like a U. Long story short, I have to wait for these extremely short pieces of hair to grow out the length of my long hair. Good luck if you take your chances with this place.",negative
"Specifically Joseph Volpe, seriously amazing stylist, articulate, experienced and up to date on styles, cuts and of course color. Over 20 years experience and has clients from day one of his career. The salon is simple, open and always plenty of parking . His prices are very affordable and he takes c/c or cash. Mostly works Tuesday thru Saturday but will makes appointments on Sunday and Monday if needed.",positive
"I recommend this studio! The staff is friendly and our stylist, Sarah, does a great job without taking a long time. I am fussy about my bangs. None of the other stylists I have been to will cut them the right way to flatter my face and keep my bangs out of my eyes. Sarah listened to me carefully the first time I went there, and she makes them look perfect each time. My boyfriend gets his hair cut at Capelli as well, and he always looks wonderful after the cut. The stylist trims his hair to make his face look handsome and manly. The prices are reasonable -- it costs more than Great Clips (ugh!), but it's worth it",positive
"Went in to get my hair cut yesterday as my first time there. Service was excellent. I was very happy to see how clean everything was, as well as how friendly the staff was. This is the only salon I go to from now on! Hair stylist: Michell.",positive
"The more I thought about my review I wanted to update. First, the business is gone now. Second, I stopped in a few weeks ago to get a manicure and ended up walking out without an appointment because the owner couldn't manage to pull herself away from her phone long enough to even greet a customer. Further, she was screaming at a customer for missing an appointment. She sounded abusive. I mean, who the heck gets that irate at a person and calls them a curse word? Get some help with your issues, lady. I'm happily getting my hair done across the street at a salon that is clean, has nice employees, and not run by a woman who could be a case study in psychopathy.",negative
"Short version - Stay away even if you have a gift card!!!! How this place stays in business is a wonder. The products they use look like they came from someone's junk drawer. This place tries to look fancy but it's all cheap low quality stuff. There is clearly a lack for training for these nice girls. The quality is very very poor especially for the prices. My polish looks like a 5 year old did it . I would have no problem paying these prices if the quality actually reflected the prices. The music was extremely loud, I don't know how someone would find a massage relaxing. We didn't have the joy of seeing the manager in person, however we did over hear several of her phone calls to the staff. All she seems to care about is making a quick buck. I don't think anyone is actually licensed. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone and I would never come back even if it was a free service.",negative
This place was absolutely horrible and the owner could not justify the additional charges that she was charging us. I would call the IRS and let them know of her unjustified charges so they can put a stop to this. This is by far the worst place I have ever seen and the owner treated us horribly.,negative
What an awful experience. The owner was rude and the service was terrible and overpriced. It was not relaxing at all. A complete waste of money.,negative
"I really wanted to like this place. I spent a lot of money on a massage, facial, mani, and pedi. Probably more money then I should have to begin with. The massage was excellent. The facial was subpar. She didn't ask me what concerns I had with my skin. She didn't ask what I was after. She didn't even ask if I had oily or dry skin. While a mask was setting she gave a leg/foot massage which was so hard I have bruises four days later. She never asked if the pressure was ok. The manicure was horrid. They didn't trim my cuticles or offer any massage that comes standard with any other manicure I've ever had. It was literally polish and that's it. And to top it all off it chipped after 3 days. Gel manicure that's supposed to last at least 7 days, chipped. The girl was also nice enough to apply shellac on my skin around my nails so it looks pretty rough. The pedicure was great excerpt the polish. They didn't put any dividers in my toes so it was smudged from the start. The owner is super sweet and spent a lot of time talking to me but in the end I paid way to much money for totally subpar services.",negative
The workers were great and the salon was nice. We went for the 189 facial and massage deal from groupon. We decided to purchase it directly from the salon. I should have asked about gratuity and sales tax prior. The owner rung us up and charged us gratuity and sales tax from the original price not the discounted price. We walked out paying 295. I hope that the girls that did the service actually receive the tip. I wanted to hand the cash over and felt akward asking to do so. The owners daughter was at the checkout counter and even though she was young it is not an excuse for her to not have better manners while talking to clients. We will not be back. To many hidden fees akward situations.,negative
"I received a gift certificate to Carlitta's a month ago, the message was fantastic. My shellac manicure wasn't the best, lasted less than a week. However, the workers were very nice and wanted to ensure I had a great experience. The real problem is when it came time to pay, the owner wouldn't accept my gift certificate. She insisted I didn't mention I got the certificate when I called to make the appointment, but I very well did. I don't understand what is the difference from a gift certificate to actual money? The owner seems like a person who is always trying to make an extra penny and probably wanted me to have to schedule another appointment so she can make twice the amount. One of the worst customer service experiences from a greedy person.",negative
I would not recommend this spa. Every word out of the owner's mouth is a sales pitch. Made me very uncomfortable. Tried charging me for bogus services. Our manicures were so had I went somewhere else after to get them fixed. Never again!,negative
Had a great experience! Had a brow waxing and haircut. Got an appointment the same day. Mary was very nice and I got a great look!,positive
"I was chose this salon to host an ""appreciation event"" for some of our business partners (financial industry). We invited our guests for ""Mani's & Pedi's"". There were 7 of us total and the event was setup from 3pm -5pm. Overall, our experience was just ok, but I would never come back here. A few things I wanted to address: Price: This place is extremely over priced for the quality of service you receive. I received a polish change and a pedicure from Jenn. She was sweet and while I did enjoy talking to her, the french tip that was done on my nails was NOT worth $20 (plus tip) My pedicure was fine but at $48 I would expected to be WOW'D! I assume they can charge so much due to location but the quality of the product and the overall experience should be up to par. Salon: When I first walked in the Salon I wasn't sure if I was in a retail store or a Salon. They have a mini-shop setup in front which is cluttered and quite honestly, disorganized. They are selling items from tea, to clothing, to purses to hair products. Is this a SPA or a retail shop? Honestly, I think the owner is really missing the mark here. if you are going to call yourself a DAY SPA and charge DAY SPA prices, you should probably focus on the SPA atmosphere and not what random item you are going to try and sell me. It was painfully obvious within a few minutes of arriving that the owner Carla was really clueless. Not only was she dressed inappropriately (black mini skirt & open-toed stilettos) not once did she follow up with us to make sure everything was running smoothly and to our expectations. I get it, she's busy but if you are going to be present in your salon it's really a good idea to make sure your guests are happy, especially, when a company chooses to hold their event and spend hundreds of dollars at your salon. When 5 o'clock rolled around and our event was over, we asked for our bill. We had to ask a total of 4 times for our bill, which is when everything just fell apart. Not only did they attempt to charge us for services that were not performed (Spa Pedicure when it was really a polish change) the girls who were cashing us out, were clueless. Bless their hearts they were just trying to help, and where was a manager or the owner? Carla was giving someone a pedicure, and did not once offer to help the poor girl who was trying to cash us out that did not know how to operate the systems. When we finally received our bill; which was hand-written on a notepad, we were never offered to include gratuity when they ran our credit cards. So of course, they had to run the card twice. Finally, when we called the salon to follow up on our dissatisfaction, not one apology. Ultimately, we will never be back here, and I do not recommend this salon for anyone looking for good quality services.",negative
"I had previously spotted this place while stopping by Melt and Panera in Independence. I happened to notice it was open late and stopped in for a quick manicure to try it out. I was a little surprised to find out that they offered 15 minute massages, but didn't have massage chairs. My manicure was good and held up for well over a week (which is really good for me!). I do plan on going back when I have time to try out a pedicure. They also have a boutique selling some clothing items and gifts that are worth checking out.",negative
"Such a beautiful salon! Right from the moment you walk in! It's very lux and upscale, and everyone is so nice. Came in as. Walk in for my pedi, basic pedi is $30, a little more than your typical nail salon, but def worth it! As the look and feel makes you feel very fancy! They make sure to provide you with a beverage of your choice ranging from water, coffee and eve champagne! Hence the name! This is an awesome place to come if your really want to feel pampered. Can't wait to come back with my ladies, to relaxed with a pedi and some champagne! The lady that did my pedi was really sweet too",positive
Brittany is an amazing stylist who is professional and stays current in the industry. She truly knows what she's doing with color and cuts and her blowouts are beyond belief! It's the first time I've ever had a blowout last for 3 days! The salon is pretty and the people at the front desk are helpful and very nice.,positive
I got a haircut by Brittany! She was very kind and knowledgeable. Felt so comfortable. Honestly the best layers I've had yet! She knows what she's doing!,positive
Just recently moving here I had no idea where to go so I took a chance and I LOVED the outcomes!! Super cute place too. For never having my hair done professionally I was a little scared but they take great care of you and have great service.,positive
Gorgeous salon with all the bells & whistles! Brittany took such good care of me & gave me the exact look I was asking for! Coached me on how to better take care of my hair. They have great deals other salons don't offer like a membership for blow outs!!!! I look forward to coming back!,positive
"It's been three weeks since I last visited this place. I must say I would prefer this place over the other location. The staff here are very welcoming. I was not impressed with the last location. They were not sure on prices and gave me such expensive deals. The lady I spoke with was saying their location is different and much better nail-techs but not according to Yelp. Anyways, the atmosphere of this location was fascinating. It allowed me to feel I was at a 5 star nail salon located on the strip. The lady who did my nails was Kayla. She was very funny and sweet to talk to (i enjoy conversations during my manicures; it's less awkward lol). I was impressed and amazed by the way she did my chrome nails. They lasted me for about 2 1/2 weeks. Definitely going to recommend this location to my friends.",positive
My hair was really damaged from a hairstylist not from Champagne's and i desperately needed to get re-done. I went to Carla who re bleached my hair and colored it. I don't know how but its healthier than ever before. She took her time and was really patient even though I had no idea what i wanted to get done. Overall I love my hair and Carla is the best!,positive
"AWESOME place!! I wanted a new hair style, something fun but not too wild. CARLA was my stylist and she made my vision come true! I showed her a simple picture I found on Pinterest of black and blue hair. She informed me of SO much and the different ways she could accomplish getting my hair to turn out that way. She let me know the safest ways to color change and what would be best for what I was going for since I didn't want to go to full black hair from my brownish/ blonde hair I currently had. Once we figured out what we were doing, she poured me some champagne and I just sat back in the chair and waited for her to do her magic! A few hours later, she did an awesome blow out, took some photos and then FINALLY let me see the final product! I LOVE IT!! My hair is freakin awesome! It's not loud, looks natural in normal light, but the blue POPS in the sunlight just right! She did a fabulous job! Seriously, anything you're looking at getting done, even if you're not sure exactly how you want it, she can guide you in the right direction and I guarantee you'll love the end product!! CARLA WAS FANTASTIC!!!",positive
"I went to a budget hair salon and had the worst haircut ever. When I got home and realized the damage I immediately called up Champagne salon to see if I could be seen for an emergency visit. They got me in right away and we're sympathetic to my awful experience. The salon is beautiful and the staff is incredibly accommodating. I walked in distressed and they offered me a complimentary glass of champagne immediately. What a wonderful touch! Free refills too ;). I was taken care of by Irene and she did a fantastic job. This is a full service salon and I'm already looking forward to my next visit, possibly for a mani pedi. Thank you so much for saving me and squeezing me in. I will be a customer for life!",positive
"Totally love this place. Erika & Tabitha are amazing! A bit pricey but, you get what you pay for right? they completely fixed all my dry dead hair and put my extensions in. i go in monthly for a tightening on them and they all know me and its so friendly :) 10/10 would reccommend.",positive
"I have been extremely disappointed with this spot several times now. The first time I got a pedi here one of the girls cut my skin by my nail and it got infected and turned into a three week ordeal. In good faith i decided to try it again because it's a cute place and conveniently located. I had a couple of decent experiences until this last time... The girl rubbed my skin so raw That I haven't been able to wear close toed shoes for days now. I have never experienced any pedicures as terrible as these girls have given me at any other place. For the cost of this spot, you'd think they'd have some girls that knew what they were doing. To top it all off, the girl finished doing my nails and just got up and left. Never massaged me or said anything indicating that she was done... She painted the last layer of paint and just got up out of nowhere and left to go gossip with coworkers. So disappointed",negative
"This place is fantastic! Everyone who works there is so friendly and welcoming. The pedicure chairs are very comfortable. I love the layout. It's nice and open and doesn't feel cramped. I had multiple services done and loved everything! Plus, they actually have champagne!",positive
"I came here for my first time today. I absolutely LOVE this place. I got a cut and shampoo & blow dry. The girl who did it I think her name was Kazar? ( something like that) She was nice and genuine which is like never heard of in Vegas, lol. She took her time, explained everything to me on what she was doing & my hair looks and feels great !!! The girls at the front desk are also very nice and friendly. I would definitely recommend Champagne Salon & Spa #2 to everyone. This place is downright awesome! Going back next week!",positive
"I follow Miss Tabitha wherever she goes and I'm so excited that she's now managing this new location right by my house. They really are a full service spa or a one stop shop, as I like to call it. From the moment I came in, I was warmly greeted by the beautiful receptionists and I love that the salon stays true to the name and offers champagne and also coffee n water. They practically cater to my every need - quick trim with Ms. Peggy (absolutely amazing and super funny), fill with the beautiful Miss Tabitha (always does me so well), pedicure with the lovely Miss Kim (very accommodating and fast) and they even fit in a girlfriend of mine last minute and have her being treated like a queen while she gets a Mani/pedi at the same time so we can both make it to work. Tabitha keeps a tight ship and I greatly appreciate her attention-to-detail when it comes to her nail shaping and artwork. More importantly, she pays close attention to the staff to ensure every client has the best experience.",positive
Absolutely this is as good as it gets with nail salons. I accidentally booked my mani/pedi at the wrong Champagne location but kept the appointment any how. I've only had one mani/pedi at the other location so don't have a certain girl yet. This location like the other one is AMAZING!! Everyone there was just as friendly and nice as the other location. Great job guys!!! Thanks so much for an amazing experience!!!!!,positive
I was looking for a Salon close to home. After reading some reviews I scheduled my appointment with Brittany. She did an awesome job cutting and styling my hair. I have short hair and like an unconventional cut. I made my next appointment for six weeks. The front desk ladies were also very friendly. Thank you!,positive
I love my manicure and pedicure! The staff was so nice! Very clean and a very good atmosphere! Definitely enjoyed my champagne! Also had my eyebrows done and they are perfect!!! Def will be back!,positive
"Hey Zee, thanks again for my beautiful nails and great conversation. You are amazing. The whole staff was a pleasure to be around. This salon has amazing people working for them. The whole staff was pleasant.",positive
"Yup, hands down Champagne Salon is the best! Fantastic customer service, upbeat atmosphere and a friendly, united team. The Ice Cream Pedi is a must due to the yummy scents to choose from and the products soak deep into the skin. My skin is still soft from yesterday! Oh, and did I mention they have Bubbles!",positive
Sitting here getting a pedicure drinking a glass of champagne and completely relaxing! Eileen is fabulous. She gave me the best foot/ lower leg massage I have ever gotten during a pedicure. Friendly staff! Not very busy on a Thursday afternoon if you are free. Will definitely be back! Wish they had more polish to choose from but it's okay! And they have packages which is unique to this Salon. I would love to do them if I had the extra money. Worth it if you get multiple services done a month.,positive
"Had my first pedicure here with a good friend. We had Jamie and Zee and they were both AaMaaziing!!! First of all the place is beautiful and immaculate. Treated with champagne which can be bottomless BTW! Upgraded to the ice cream pedi and did not regret it, product was amazing. The girls were so fun and did a wonderful job. Will definitely be back!!",positive
I had the most amazing experience ever the staff was absolutely wonderful. Zee did a great job on my nails and I will Never go anywhere else! Hannah did a rockstar job!!! She hooked my husband up with a new due she is awesome this is my new favorite place to go!!!,positive
I went to the salon for a mani and pedi today and it was an amazing experience. The salon is absolutely beautiful and the staff is very friendly and professional. The massage chairs during the pedicure were very nice and gave you a nice soothing massage while you get your toes done. Z did my pedicure and she is an absolute doll. She was very professional and gave me an awesome foot massage too. Karla did my nails and she was a sweetheart. Both girls were great and I definitely will be coming back to this beautiful salon for all my beauty needs.,positive
Brittany did my hair and it is so beautiful! This salon is top notch. And so beautiful you feel like royalty every time you step in the door. Love this place I won't go anywhere else!,positive
This place is amazing!! I got.my haircut from Jamie and I must say it's probably the best haircut I have gotten. Make sure to stop by and check it out.,positive
Brittany cut my hair and gave me a mani/pedi. She is fantastic!! Highly recommend her. Finally found a great stylist! The salon is full service and super clean.,positive
"I recently got my hair cut and beard trimmed/styled here. The salon is very nice and provides a comfortable atmosphere. Jamie is terrific! She does a great job, and is extremely friendly and welcoming. It's like spending a half hour or so with an old friend who just happens to give great haircuts.",positive
"Scratch other spas and salons! This is it. Why oh why do not more of these places exist? Beautiful atmosphere, crystal chandeliers, smells like heaven. Lifestyle monthly memberships to fit every taste! Eyelash extentions with mink! Yes! Found my new happy place in the desert. Eileen is bomb diggity with pedicures. Hannah the OGM is fantastic....",positive
I recently experienced my first facial at this new salon. It was quiet a amazing experience! The staff was friendly and treated me very well! I was happy with the service and the special deals they had! They have full service of just about everything. Definitely will be going back to experience some of the other services that they offer.,positive
Amazing service. Aileen was my nail tech and she was very professional and did exactly what I asked for. Was also very fast. Great staff overall!,positive
I can't say enough good things about Jennifer - she is AMAZING. She has turned my hair into what i could only dream of before - she is incredible! Take my word for it....go to her! You wont be disappointed!,positive
"Jennifer is the hair goddess!! She is always so on point with what I want. She is super knowledgeable about anything relating to hair, beauty, and so much more. Her salon is always clean and super cute. She also sells her artwork which is super cute. I highly recommend her if you are looking for a new stylist.",positive
"Jennifer is amazing!!! Champange Strands is the perfect name for this salon since she specializes in blonde hair. I have always had long blonde hair for years. I decided about 2 years ago after lots of processing of my hair that I would go au nautrual. Recently, I went to my friends wedding and Jennifer had driven from Charlotte to about an hour and half away to do her hair and makeup. I new from that moment she was going to be my next stylist! My friend looked the best I have ever seen her in our 25 years of knowing one another. I could not be more pleased with how my ""champange strands"" turned out. She took the time to listen to what I truly wanted. I even still have extremely healthy hair. Not only is she a great stylist but she is sweet too! I will never go anywhere else but to see her. I have nothing but positive things to say!",positive
Jennifer is a true artist. She customizes the cut to your face structure and hair type and gives you color that works with your skin color. She is super relaxed and knows her stuff!,positive
Jennifer is awesome! She always does amazing with my cut and color and was absolutely beyond amazing doing my wedding updo and make up! Definitely worth the drive from Greensboro!,positive
You can rest assured that you're in good hands here! Jennifer is amazing at hair and makeup. I have long blonde hair and I'm very particular about my color. She made my hair look better than ever. If you're looking for a new and trendy place in the uptown Charlotte area then you definitely need to check this place out :),positive
"I am a terrible hair owner- the only thing I can ever be bothered to do with my hair is wash and sporadically brush it, and I generally only drag myself into a salon once or twice a year. Since I discovered Chic Effectz, I've been so much more motivated to get my hair done a bit more regularly, because this place not only does a wonderful job, but they don't over charge for their services. Because I neglect my locks, I usually need quite a bit of work done when I actually do get into a salon, and I have gotten a number of finger wags and ""tsk-tsk's"" from some stylists who assert that all hair must be cut every 6 to 8 weeks, which is probably an excellent habit but not one I will ever adopt for myself. There was no judgement from the stylists at Chic Effectz, however, and what I got instead was a comfortable atmosphere, pleasant conversation, and the exact hairstyle including hi-lights that I had asked for. I don't know for sure when I will next set foot in a hair salon, but I do know that when I do find my way back to a stylist's chair, it will be at Chic Effectz.",positive
I took my mother in for a wash and set. She was given a blow dry and iron as the stylist Mary Jo said she has been doing this since the 70s and knows how to do one as well as a set. It was a faster appointment for Mary Jo and only lasted less than 2 days and was a waste of mom's money. Also Mary Jo took a personal call while attending to my mother and stopped what she was doing for 10 minutes all the while leaning over my mom and resting her elbow on the shelf. She said it was a very important call about a quote for her backyard. Funny enough though when the salon phone rang she let it go to voicemail. When mom was paying the stylist shoved a card at me and said I should come by and try them out.........not a chance.,negative
"I was very disappointed with the ombre I got done. I had recently lost a lot of weight and really wanted something WAY different! I was told I could not do a bleach blonde but a caramel colour she would do. Since I always have caramel highlights put it I thought whatever. I was never showed the colour it would be, just went straight onto my hair before I even realized it. Anyways cost 200$ for nothing different, nobody noticed or anything. My friend said my ends looked a little light but that's it! Very very disappointed and felt like I was totally ripped off. Right after my appointment I drove straight to the reliable salon that I knew and the girl couldn't believe what was put in my hair as 'ombre'. Scheduled an appointment and will not return to Chic Effectz. Everyone that works there is nice but wouldn't recommend it to the younger clientele Middle age +",negative
Great place. Carol is a great stylist who listens to what you want and gives you the colour you ask for. She's also lovely to talk to - warm and gentle. They are all are so welcoming - makes you want to go back. Really look forward to my appointments. They also have a great sulphate free product line.,positive
"Went there because I bought a coupon for cut and colour, I didn't expect much because it's going to be a coupon service, however, after a brief chat about what colour and cut I wanted, Carol did exactly what I asked for, I was very happy coming out of her salon, I'd recommend it.",positive
Today Ashley worked miracles on the mess of hair I had. She took the time and listened to what I wanted and gave me advice on what I should do. I am so happy with the outcome and will always get my hair cut at Cleo's.,positive
I went here last week to get a digital perm. The staff were nice and they did a good job. It was worth to drove 22 miles to get my digital perm there!,positive
Friendly and fast service. $25 flat rate for women's hair curt. I was a bit nervous that there would be a language barrier but she was very respectful of what I wanted. Would definitely go here again.,positive
"I booked the same day appointment at Cleo Salon with Ashley, the best decision ever. She really took her time and cut my hair and listened what I want. I used to have to fly to LA for hair cut, but not any more now. Thanks for the service Ashley!",positive
They gave me the haircut i wanted Ashley Whenever i asked for the haircut i wanted at the other salons they always fucked up the length of my bangs but here they cut it to perfection First time here but GOD DAMN they good ~~~,positive
"I probably waited too long to post this but 2 weeks ago I got the Japanese straightening treatment I was worried the chemical used for the treatment would damage my hair a lot but nope it's fabulous and silky straight, I love it. I'm definitely coming back.",positive
I always come to Mr. Kim whenever I need a haircut because he is simply the best in the valley! I will not trust anyone else with my hair because he is the only one that gets it right every time. I would definitely recommend this place to everyone!,positive
I have recently moved to AZ and so glad I found Cleo beauty salon. Kim has done a wonderful hair cut and high light for me. Thank You Kim!!,positive
"Had my first digital perm few days ago. It turned out much better than I had hoped for. You can choose the size of the curls and since I had shoulder length hair, I opted for medium sized curls. Very pleased with how it turned out; not your traditional perm. It's what you call beach wave or curls you get with a curling iron, but right out of the shower. Very easy care as well. Just twirl your wet hair in large chunks and let it air dry. So simple. I am in love! Best part is my hair is still very healthy.",positive
"I love my hair color and haircut! Mr. Kim and Saki were very professional and very pleasant. Mr Kim did an excellent job and he knows exactly what I wanted to do with my hair. Not only that, he gives the best advice and he is upfront in telling you on what is good and damaging to your hair. Price is reasonable. Im happy and very satisfied with my hair. Will definitely recommend to my friends!!",positive
"They're one of the best I have been to in the Phoenix area. I had a haircut and digital perm today. The hair designer is so professional. He has been in the business for 27 years. He knows what to do. I was also impressed to hear that he had lived and worked in Japan before coming to AZ. Honestly, I feel like the price is a kind of expensive. But I was satisfied what I got. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PLACE.",positive
"I've been coming to this salon since I've moved to Arizona and have always remained loyal. This man seriously knows what he's doing. I barely have to tell him what I want done, yet he does exactly what I want and more. If you say you only want an inch off, he listens well and will only cut what you want. He is also the sweetest man. I could rave about how amazing this salon is all day. I highly recommend this salon to everybody! Y'all NEED to get your hair done here, if not... You're a fool.",positive
"As a Japanese, it was very difficult to find the suitable hairstylist in U.S who knows how to treat Asian hairs and Asian hair styling. He is very experienced with Asian hairs and styling and he speaks Japanese fluently so that I can communicate with him about my order in my own language smoothly! His cut is very quick and great quality! I truly recommend this salon to Asian girls especially! Thank you very much!",positive
"I knew I wanted The Japanese hair straightening treatment early last year so I thought I'd start saving up and growing out my hair. I'm a person who gets easily persuaded out of things and that's exactly what everybody was trying to do to me. I'm so glad I stuck to my gut and got this treatment done. I got it done on July 22 2015, I arrived 30 minutes early (due to not wanting to be late, because it's an hour drive) and mr Kim was more then generous to get started on me. He prices the treatment based on the length and density of your hair. (I have long frizzy thick curly hair) after an hour of working on my hair his wife showed up and they both went at it. And thank god because I was there for a total of 5 hours!! It's now the 25th and I just washed my hair for the first time and this is the best decision ever made!! TIPS. Buy a satin pillow to keep your hair looking brand new the two days you can't wash it. I will update my review in s week or so to let you guys know if I'm still able to curl and how it's holding up.",positive
"So I have tried many hair stylists in Phoenix and some have been ok. Generally, I have not been 100% satisfied with any of the cuts. Most stylists don't get that I need volume on top to balance out my round, asian face. I am half asian and really have had the best luck in the with asians cutting my hair. I did some research and found Kim. He is very nice, but take note - this guy has skills. He was trained at Vidal Sassoon in London so he knows what he is doing. The first time he cut my hair, admittedly it was too short, but even growing it out after 3 months - the style looked good. I went back for a trim and I was pretty clear about what I wanted to do (not go too short) and he nailed it. I am so happy with my cut. Even the people who color my hair were impressed with his technique. Most stylists in PHX do not have his level of skill and charge outrageous fees. A wash, cut and blowdry was $25 - you can't beat that with a stick. It is not a fancy salon, but I don't want to pay for atmosphere - I want a cut I am happy with. If that is your goal (Asian or not) Kim is worth visiting.",positive
"My first time here. I have very thick and coarse asian hair. I have another stylist that cuts my hair but at $75 for every monthly visit it gets expensive. So I ventured out and found Cleo. This isn't a 5 star luxury place, but he will listen to you, input his opinion and do the job right. I like how much lighter my hair feels. I look much younger now lol. The chair at the shampoo station is very comfortable. It's actually the same chair at the salon I used to go to. He's very fast. I will be gone for 2 months and when I come back I will try his deep conditioning treatment. Overall I'm very happy.",positive
"I have been straightening my hair from the last 10 years. Have tried a number of salons. As there were not many salons with experience in Phoneix, I usually used to get it straightened from LA or SFO. Thanks to Yelp I found Cleo Beauty salon. I am so glad to find some one so much closer. The owner Kim who did the straightening uses Yuko and seems to have good amount of experience using the product. They were quite meticulous going through each step with a lot of care. The end result is really impressive. Yuko is a great product and with the right stylist the outcome would be great. Though Kim doesn't have yuko conditioner or shampoo, I would recommend getting those products from amazon or any other retailer. It smells great and is really good for chemically straightened hair. I highly recommend this salon.",positive
"This is a really good place. I've had my hair digitally permed four times now and he has done the best job of all the others. I like the team of husband and wife working together it did help it go quicker. He also really did understand what he was doing, he took his time trimming and a layering it so that it would lay nicely when it was permed. And it was also cheaper than the others even though he took just as much time to really cut it and blow dry it and stylet. Looking to find this so close to my house.",positive
I am completely happy with the results. The Salon owner cut my hair and did a great job. Making this place my Salon for all my future hair needs.,positive
Been coming here for many years for the Asian straight perm.. Never fails! Hair is so silky smooth. He is always looking for the best hair products to use on his clients. I enjoy when his wife washes my hair..feels like a nice head massage lol.,positive
"I had the best experience here. It's not fancy or anything, but Mr Kim is incredible. He's got decades of experience, studied in London. He's the only stylist I would trust in the state to do Japanese Thermal Straightening (Yuko) on my hair. Now my hair air dries sleek and gorgeous, and so shiney! And it was so affordable! I will drive the 45 minutes every time - so worth it!",positive
"I just went to Cleo Salon to get my hair cut for the first time. Hands down, I got the best haircut of my life. A friend recommended Cleo Salon months ago and I am kicking myself for not making an appointment sooner. The other reviews are pretty much spot on. The salon is located in an unassuming strip mall in Glendale and is far from the posh salons in Scottsdale and other areas of Phoenix. What you get is friendly, professional service from someone who is truly an expert in Asian hair. I called earlier today and was able to get a same day appointment for this afternoon. When I arrived, there were a few other clients in the salon, but I had only a momentary wait. A woman washed my hair and the stylist, Mr. Kim, was ready to cut my hair as soon as I was done with the shampoo. As soon as he started working on my hair, it was clear that he ""got it,"" in terms of what I was looking for in a style. The wash, cut, and blow dry took about 25 minutes and cost a total of $20. Overall, I had an incredibly positive experience and will be going back there in a month or two for another cut.",positive
"I love Mr. Kim! I was so scared to digiperm my hair for the first time ever...or to really just do anything with my hair because I'm obsessed with healthy smooth hair, but honestly this was the best decision I've ever made, hair-wise haha. I repermed my hair after about 6 months, because my hair is naturally super straight. My hair felt slightly dry at first which was suspected due to the chemicals, but after a week or two it was back to it's normal smooth silky self :)! I also washed my hair every day, so maybe for those who do the ""every other day washing"" routine, it may last longer than 6 months before you are just left with waves instead of bouncy curls. Mr. Kim advised me to blow-dry and twist with your fingers to give it that curling iron curl look...but I personally do not like blow-drying unless really necessary. I simply combed through my hair with my fingers in the shower or a large tooth comb and scrunched it while air-drying. Definitely the only salon I will go to for digital perming.",positive
"Today it was my second visit to this salon. Actually this time I was visiting in from North Carolina just for 2 days and visiting Cleo was one of my top priorities of this trip since I can't find awesome hair stylist like Mr. Kim in my new area. Last September I got digital perm - outcome was gorgeous and long-lasting. I have received many many compliments. Today I got just a hair cut, which revived my digital perm nicely :) Mr. Kim has long experience doing digi perm both in Japan and in this country, it makes him pick right amount of time etc to make a desired style. I guess I will fly back to AZ again for my next digi perm!",positive
"I lived in South Korea for a year, which is where I got my first Japanese Hair Straightening. My hair has a very thick wave in the back that is hidden by a layer of straight hair. I have tried the Brazilian Blowout on my hair twice and not noticed any change (and it's more expensive). Since being back in the states, I decided that I needed to find somewhere to get my hair straightened since my own hair stylist doesn't do this. I found Cleo Beauty Salon and it was just like being back in Korea. Mr. Kim and his wife, who run the salon, are both Korean and fabulous at what they do. I HIGHLY recommend them!!! My hair looks fantastic, and that's saying a lot! It was well worth the $150 and 3.5 hours. Beware of other salons that want to charge anywhere from $400-900 depending on length and thickness.... I doubt there's a difference and why pay more when Cleo's does a fabulous job! I will most certainly be back to do this again once my roots grow out.",positive
"Just got a digital perm today. Took 2 hours and half. Although I got a better and bigger curls else where 8 months ago (which lasted for a good 6 months) in San Diego, this place is good. The only con is that my hair is a lot dryer which is expected from and it's not as the big curly wave (should have went with my instinct by using the big roller instead. Kim recommended medium roller so that the curl wouldn't be lose). Ps: I have very thick wavy hair and I posted my result :)..",positive
I recently had a digital perm done here and I absolutely love the results! Mr. Kim is very talented. I will definitely return in the future for another perm!,positive
"My haircut was awesomely done, Shampoo+cut+blowdry for $20. Price was very reasonable and the staff were friendly. I now know where to go for my regular haircuts. I'm going to try their magic hair treatment next year and write about it when I get it done.",positive
"I'm so glad I found this salon!!! After getting my hair burned last year & then finding out that Hair City in Phoenix closed I wasn't sure where to go to get my hair magic straightened. I even debated driving out to LA to get my hair done in Koreatown. But luckily I received a referral to Cleo's from a Korean restaurant and so I went here and am glad I did! I got my hair magic straightened (aka japanese straightened) and the stylist did a great job. Although my hair didn't come out perfectly, I blame myself because I recently had my hair highlighted at an american salon and apparently the american salon used bleach in my hair. And bleach plus magic will frizz hair. I learned this from the stylist at Cleo. I have to give extra credit to the stylist at Cleo, because he kept asking me if I had used bleach in my hair for highlights. And I kept telling him no, but he kept asking so I finally called the salon where I had my hair highlighted where they told me that they do use bleach when highlighting! (unsure why they didn't use regular color since I was complaining about how my old highlights had turned yellow, and now my new highlights are turning yellow too! I think bleach highlights is too hard on my hair). I'm really glad the Cleo stylist was so adamant on finding out if bleach was used on my hair, otherwise I would have had a hair disaster this year (like I did last year!-- and no I did not have highlights on my hair last year, last year my hair was in perfect condition, no treatments had been done on my hair.) I also saw that Cleo has machines for digital perms too. I might have to try this next year after I grow my hair out (since my hair is currently shorter than usual because of the disaster from last year) Go here get your hair done by an expert. He told me he was trained in both Korea & Japan. So he speaks Korean, Japanese, & English. I believe magic straight costs about $150, at least that's what I paid. And digital perm costs around $130",positive
"Small salon located on Thunderbird Rd across from ASU West. They're very accommodating. Mr. Kim trained at Vidal Sassoon, Toni&Guy, and 8 years in Japan. He uses Japanese hair manicure products. Reasonable prices! And for my Japanese peeps he speaks Japanese.",positive
This place has decent products for hair. The prices are more expensive than you can source elsewhere. (eg. Eglinton West salons). Had a hair appointment with Aisha. I was totally underwhelmed given her cocky attitude and lack of styling abilities.,negative
"Never mind what I said in my last review. They are really rude here. They think it's cute, but it's dumb and cheap to act rude and weird with customers. Like what are you doing? If you hate your job and you hate the customers then bounce. They're so awkward here. One time one girl was great. That's it. I'm done. I'll go back though because they're cheap.",negative
"I was a little apprehensive in making an in-store trip after reading Yelp reviews regarding the poor attitudes of store associates. However - I found the associates to be approachable. A young woman asked an associate for assistance and she was helped right away. I found every item on my list (which was quite exciting) and headed to the cash register. Kyesha was friendly and signed me up for the Clore points club. Good looking out. I don't know about its hair selection as I don't know the first thing about wigs and weaves. But it's a large store with plenty of hair care items (shampoos, conditioners, cowashes, hot oils, relaxer kits, deep conditioners, etc). It's filled with American hair products - a little overpriced but the selection is great. All in all it was a great experience.",positive
"Very shitty customer service! The girls look at you as though they don't want to work (except one with the natural caesar haircut, she's cool), especially, the one with the fake Yaki. Ms. ma'am! Nobody cares about your man problems! Either get rid of him or purchase a B.O.B. (battery operated boyfriend). When they do decide to work, they just monitor your activity to avoid theft. Half the products there are counterfeit and they don't do exchanges fairly. I went to purchase a shampoo, didn't use it nor open it, return to the store the next day and the store manager said that it was used so she didn't accept the return it. I mentioned to her my hair is unwashed how can you validate it, then she changes her excuse and mentions it's a final sale. After I countered her statement by simply stating there was no stamp on my receipt disclaiming final sale nor no communication from the cashier regarding final sale, she simply just said no I can't exchange nor return. I peacefully left and never returned the store. Please be cautious regarding where you are investing your money. Your money should equate to good, quality product and customer service.",negative
"I agree with you Nisha D. For the past year or so the service has been horrible. I've only had 2 experiences that were considered Ok. The management can't seem to handle the staff they hire, the girls are blatantly rude and abrasive with customers. Don't ask questions about the products because you WILL be ignored. We should boycott the store, there's no reason to give money to people who can't train their staff or discipline them after a complaint is being made. You walk into the store in a happy mood and leave feeling shattered by the rudeness and the lack of customer service training.",negative
"I've ordered twice more since my last review and service remains consistently fast and accurate. Always with a bunch of new samples. Shipping is pricy so I always spend the minimum for free shipping ($75). Whoops, I'm a bit of a beauty junkie:)",positive
Love this place! The girls here know hair. Very friendly and knowledgeable staff. The staff takes their time with clients. My favorite place in Toronto!!!,positive
"Great stock and variety for different hair types, decent prices plus a really convenient location!! The cashiers were really pleasant. Other staff could stand to undergo a bit of customer service training but all in all, shopping here is a good experience. I would definitely recommend their store.",positive
"Don't go here unless you want to get yelled at for trying to exchange a DEFECTIVE product. Staff is rude and just rolled their eyes when asking to speak to a manager. Eventually after having to explain my situation to the manager (who I had to approach myself) many times over, and having her staff raise their voice at me, I eventually received a replacement for the defective product. As a professional make up artist and hairstylist, I need to spend a lot of money on hair supplies, but I will certainly not be doing it here any longer. There are many other places to shop for these things in Toronto, and I recommend that you do it elsewhere. Highly reccomended is Ragga Beauty Supply.",negative
"Went in with an old balayage that I wanted gone. Asked to get an ombré that faded from my naturally black hair into a brown and then a darker blonde (I even showed pictures). I told her Im not a fan of the way blonde looks on my skin tone so I wanted more of a brown COLOR than the blonde. The first time she bleached and toned it (for maybe two minutes before she immediately washed it out) it came out horribly blonde all over my head and she asked if I was happy and I almost jumped out of the chair. I told her that's not what I wanted and once again showed her the picture. She then went and asked her coworker what to do and toned my hair again. At this point she tried to do the same thing again and tone my hair for like 5 minutes and when I told her I wanted it darker she was like ""well that sounds right"". I'd had my hair done professionally before and I knew it would take anywhere from 20-45 minutes to tone me down to a darker blonder. She never applied color to my hair and so when I left it was not what I wanted but I initially thought something I could live with. I got home and washed my hair and realized she did no blending and where she had bleached my hair on the front of my head (if I had bangs it would be my bangs) she never blended so it looked like I had three months of outgrowth and didn't get my hair done the day before. I ended up going to a Supercuts to get it redone and they did a great job coloring my hair into an ombré and getting rid of the bad blend job. I don't think she actually knew how to do ombré and if so she shouldn't have agreed to doing that on my hair. The haircut was nice and that's about all I have to say that was good about the experience.",negative
Took my daughter for first time great service and did awesome job with her nails . She was extremely happy and will be bringing her back for her hair. Professional and I believe in supporting local businesses,positive
Hand Down best hairstylist in Town all the girls are amazing. Very talented group of young ladies with a great environment.,positive
Sendy has been my stylist for quite some time now. She is experienced and knows how to take care of my hair! Check her salon out!,positive
"If your looking for a forever hairstylest you can definitely find her here! MYROSE is great with color,cuts!! She really takes her time and gives you what you want without damaging your hair! She's amazing!!!",positive
"All I have to say is Myrose. She is the only person allowed to touch my hair. I started going to her for over a year now and I am obsessed. They way she cuts and colors hair is amazing. I had never colored my hair before until just recently, and she did an amazing ombré on me. My sister and about five other friends go to her as well. This place is fairly new and beyond underrated. Hair cuts are affordable (make sure to tip well) and the staff is friendly. They provide free wifi, coffee and water. Thank you Myrose for being the best hair dresser I've ever had.",positive
"Went in a month ago for a simple haircut, and Myrose took care of me, she was very nice and welcoming since it was my first time there. She did a fabulous job, she recommended to do a blow out and I loved it!! I felt fabulous, my sister went in last week with stylist Sendy for an ombré and she gets compliments on the daily about her hair. I went in again today to cut my daughters hair and to put in some color on mine and I'm in love all over again! Sendy did my hair this time, and I highly recommend her, overall a Very nice staff and very affordable, I even got a glass of wine;)",positive
"The 2 times I was able to get in to have my son's haircut, it was done well. However, I have called the shop repeatedly to make appointments and there is never any answer and no return phone call after i've left multiple messages. I decided to just stop by one day (during regular business hours, which are clearly posted on the door of the shop) and it was NOT open. I drove a fairly far distance to get my son's haircut for nothing. I called the shop immediately to leave a message and even THAT message was never returned. This is horrible business and the shop owners should be ashamed that they run their business in this manner. If something crazy is happening in the owner's life, where she was literally unable to be at the store that day or any other day, she should make return phone calls to explain. Things happen and I get that, absolutely - however, that did not happen. Very disappointed.",negative
"Tara does a great job cutting my son's hair. However, they never answer the phone or return phone calls. One day I drove by in hopes to schedule an appointment. There was a family waiting at the door. Tara had no showed. The shop was closed, and nobody was there to cut their child's hair as promised. I left, then drove by a second time the same day, after my errand was complete at another store. Another family was again waiting outside the door. Nobody was there for the appointment they had scheduled. I'm not sure how this shop will stay in business.",negative
"This is the ONLY place I go to get my sons (2yr old) haircut!! He has been going here for over 6 months! Tara is Amazing!! She is extremely patient with my son who wiggles and screams in his seat almost the entire time! She uses scissors for all of his hair except to trim around the ears and neckline! I really don't know how she does it!! As far as the comments about answering the phone, I have been in the salon when the phone rings and she doesn't leave her client to answer the phone when it rings... Which I find to be very respectful! So if you call and it doesn't ring... Try again later because she is probably with a client. I have been to other places to try and get my sons haircut and they won't even try because he starts to cry. So thank you Tara for your Patience and GREAT cuts!",positive
"Nice folks, kids like getting haircuts here. I usually get mine cut as well since I""m already there. We're regulars here.",positive
"This salon ROCKS!!! Hands down! Myself, three boys and even my husband have been attending this salon for over six years now. All the stylist are very professional and do a fabulous job! They take their time to make kids of all ages comfortable; which is more than I can say for the place we went to prior to coming to Comb-A-Cabana. I should also mention that I live in Cave Creek and it is WELL worth the drive!!",positive
"I won't be going back. My son's hair was butchered. I'm not exaggerating! Several people commented on how terrible it looked. I had to go out and buy scissors to fix it. Since we left the shop with his hair wet it was hard to tell it was so messed up. I mean different lengths, rat tails, just awful. My daughter got a trim and that went well. They barely took anything off and I think it would be impossible to mess that up. They put a little braid in her hair and that was cute. This place is probably fine for a trim. Maybe we just got a bad hair stylist. I know we didn't get the one that everyone is raving about on here.",negative
"My 6 year old boy/girl twins have been going to Tara for at least 3+ years & look forward to getting their hair cut! For the first couple years we went to another popular franchised ""kids"" place (similar to this place where kids sit in a race car chair & watch a kiddie video) but with disasterous results. And it was twice as expensive. The kind you look back on and wince at photos because the hairdresser looks like they used a large bowl to cut their hair. Not Tara! She always asks just before she is done how mom likes it (I usually ask for a little more taken off with my sons pointy back nape) and, I get compliments about their haircuts too. When Tara has time she usually puts sparkle hairspray or a few cute braids or mini ponietails in the front bang area. Bonus! And all for a very cheap price. Did I mention the free lollipop at the end? What more could you ask for in a kids hair place! Oh and she cut my hair once when I was in a pinch. :) :)",positive
"This place rocks! Yesterday was our first visit to Comb-A-Cabana. Our 3 year old has never been good getting a haircut. In fact, he's been awful. I'm sure you all know what I'm talking about- the ""kicking, screaming, you must be trying to kill me with the comb"" type. Our anxiety levels rose as we were approaching another dreaded haircut, but their place was just different. It was down to earth and relaxing. They had lots of toys for our son to play with while waiting. When it was his turn, our son refused to go to the chair so Lacy did his haircut right there at the train table. She also avoided the spray bottle since that would upset him more. Even two older kids that were there were really getting into making his experience better and were blowing bubbles to entertain him. The entire experience was just so awesome. I was just so pleased that they were accommodating to his needs and for the first time ever we had a tear free haircut. And FYI, for the little ones that are willing to make it to the chair, they have a large TV with movies playing and a fire truck or car to sit in. They also had regular chairs for the older kids. We will make this our regular hair cutting place for sure!!!",positive
"Miss Tara has been cutting my 3 kids hair for over a year and does a consistent fabulous job! She is patient and listens to exactly what you want your kids hair cut to look like. You can't beat the price and the kids love to play video games while getting their hair done. In fact, I love her so much she now cuts & colors MY hair! She has over 18 years experience and is a color magician!! Make an appointment with Tara and you will not be disappointed.",positive
"I love this place, specially now that it has been remodeled and the best two stylist stayed (this used to be Snip-A-Dee-Doo-Dah). Ms. Tara and Ms. Julie are really great. The salon is airy and fresh looking, and has a nice playing area for the kids as well as TV and DVD players for them to watch movies while getting their hair cut. Today my little girl had the works, she even let her hair be wash in the ""big girls"" sink. Ms. Julie finished her cut and made a beautiful braided crown and put little flowers around. She looked adorable. My little boy, well there is not much to do with a boy, but he got his hair cut nicely and spiked. Total rocker.",positive
A great value for a far superior hair cut than are likely to get from a national chain. We have been going to Tara for 3 years and she has created a warm and friendly environment that kids love. There are plenty of TV's for kids to watch a show if they are not big fans of haircuts.,positive
"Had my sons first haircut here, the staff was very friendly and made our experience great! They put on a movie and let him play around in the chair before getting started so he would feel more comfortable. I traveled from Tucson to this location just to get his haircut and it was worth it. With his first hair cut they gave us a certificate to place a picture into accompanied by the first lock of his hair they cut off! Overall great experience, would recommend.",positive
We had such a great experience here. Decided to take our toddler here after a not so great experience at a grown up barbershop. We made an appointment with Heather. We were late but she didn't mind. She put on Elmo for him and was so incredibly sweet. He got the coolest haircut!! I was nervous taking him to a kids place thinking they couldn't give him the kind of cut I wanted but it looked better than the grown man barbershop. We will definitely be back to see Heather!,positive
"Made a same day appointment for my son, I was honestly hesitant t because of the reviews, but so often people only the post the negative. And the place is close, so I thought I'd give it a try. Tarin (I think that's her name) did a great job. She was interactive w my little guy, followed my instructions perfectly. She wasn't pushy, she wasn't rude, she did exactly what I asked for. We will definitely be going back! Thanks so much guys!",positive
"My son just got his first hair cut here, HORRIBLE HAIR CUT! It is so uneven, not even close to what I asked for. Never coming here again! STAY AWAY! Trust me people choose any other place but this one. His hair cut is soooo horrible its embarrassing and I feel like I'm going to cry and barf. Stay away.",negative
"First haircut today with my toddler. Fantastic experience! Maribel did wonderful. She was patient and kind. Her haircut was fantastic too. She gave him a ""1st haircut certificate"". So glad I came here. Ask for Maribel!",positive
"Recently went here for a hair cut and after she shaved half my son's head she stopped and said that she could not finish his haircut because he had head lice. I paid for the hair cut (she shaved the bottom part of his head)and then She had me buy a 25.00 bottle of lice shampoo (that I returned). When we left we looked at my son's head and we did not see anything other than what looked like flakes. We took him to another salon where they looked at his head and said they did not see lice and they finished his hair cut. We also had the school do a check the next morning and yet again got the reply no he does not have lice. Here is the reply from the school ""Hello the nurse given the all clear so no worries I think that woman just over reacted so anyway talk at talk to you later. Bye bye. "" . We will not be taking our son here again.",negative
"We have been to this location a handful of times and always have had a positive experience. Yesterday, I took my daughter in and it was terrible. Carla was the stylist on the floor and while she was nice, she did an awful job cutting my daughters hair. I asked for her to trim off about 1.5 inches and add in some light textured layers to help lift my daughters curls. Since my daughter is 7 I didn't want to hoover, so I sat up front. I was shocked by how awful the cut was. The layers looked hacked and her hair was crooked (which she corrected upon pointing it out). I didn't say anything, because I didn't want to upset my daughter. Thank goodness hair grows... just not fast enough so save my daughter from the butcher job.",negative
"My husband took our son to get a haircut at the Scottsdale location, and I thought it would be an awesome quality of haircut due to the environment and reviews. I was so disappointed and upset, his haircut was HORRIBLE! Patchy, not even, and just an awful cut! I don't think it's even worth going back! So disappointing!",negative
"My son and I love this place. Marissa is thee best. The first time she cut my son's hair, I was totally amazed at the great job she's done. I've gone to other places and many others have cut my son's hair. I do not trust anyone else and done with the awful and disappointing haircuts. She is such a sweet heart and great with kids. This evening there were three kids ahead of us. We didn't have an appointment and Marissa was the only one working. She was totally courteous and worth the wait.",positive
"My 4year old asked if she could get her haircut so I brought her here. The lady we had was very rude. She was very short with my daughter and not ""kid friendly"". My daughter wanted her haircut to above her shoulders. When the lady said she was done I noticed there were obvious pieces that were longer and I asked her to fix them. She then got out an electric razor to apparently fix the pieces and used it on the rest of her head/neck. She told my daughter it might tickle. My daughter was being very still and cooperative up until this point and was very distracted watching her movie. When she started using the electric razor my daughter started occasionally jerking her head and the lady was getting very short with her saying ""stay still it only tickles"". After about the 4th jerk my daughter starts crying (very unlike her!). At the same time the stylist said she was done. I got my daughter out of the chair and noticed multiple cuts on her neck. No wonder my daughter cried, she was being cut! The stylist didn't stop to look at what she was doing or if she was cutting her, instead she kept telling my daughter to stop moving it only tickled! I then told the stylist she cut her and this was the only time I hear a ""kid friendly"" voice come out and she said ""oh I'm so sorry"" and she put some powder on her neck. I then proceeded to pay full price for this traumatic haircut. At home I still had to fix my daughters hair as it was still very uneven. I notified the manager of this event through the website and I got an email back saying she will speak with her staff about the situation and to please call her or email her with anything further. She did leave her phone number but no email (it came from a ""do not reply"" email so I could not just reply to it). I wanted to send her the pictures of my daughters neck so I called to talk with her on the phone and get an email address for her but never got a call back. I am so disappointed with the whole situation and the lack of being able to contact the manager. I will not be going back here! I will post a picture of my daughters neck in the photo section.",negative
"I tried to make an appointment for my son's first haircut. The lady on the phone was rude! They are out of certificates, so she told me I would have to come back a 2nd time to complete the package I was going to pay for. I asked if they could just mail it to me. Nope. Ty but I believe in good customer service and will take my son and money else where!",negative
"My son needed his first haircut and someone had recommended cool cuts, I was skeptical because the not so great reviews- but I'm glad I went anyway. I made an appointment and they got me in in an hour. When I got there no customers were there so we wouldn't have even had to wait. Yasmine was amazing- she put in a movie and made sure he was happy the whole time. In the end I didn't have a screaming baby (he was very happy in fact) and the haircut looked great. I would recommend taking your kids here, I know I'll go back.",positive
"I had a perfectly lovely experience here for my daughters first haircut! She is 3 and given the reviews I read I was on guard and prepared for the worst but I also know the bad experiences get posted and not always the good so I took a shot. The 2 stylists were very nice and when they saw my daughter they ""fought"" over who got to give her a cut. Julia ""won"" and let my baby pick out a movie and a car to sit in (she picked the train). Since my daughters hair texture is a lot like mine I gave her my thoughts on what should be done and listened to everything I said and we ended up with a beautiful cut. She then styled my girls hair with a cute side braid (which I could never ever do myself) and let her pick out a colored ribbon (green). I will for sure come back and will probably have Julia style her hair before our next family photos are taken. We did get the first haircut keepsake as promised as well. Nothing fancy but it was nice to get it. So for you worried moms I say give them a chance. They exceeded my expectation.",positive
It was my sons first haircut and we decided on a whim to try you out since we were in the area. It was a little busy when we got there but I realize that we didn't have an appointment and we had a waiting time. When we were next the lady was super friendly and very talkative which is great for kids! My son did so well for his first haircut and you made it a good experience. Thank you.,positive
"In my opinion, they did not have good customer service. We arrived and no one immediately checked us in. There were 3 people working there and no one was waiting. By checking in, I am referring to them registering us, taking our name etc. The lady in charge asked if we were a walk in or an appointment. Once we told them we were a walk-in, she didn't say anything else to us. One employee said she would check us in but then ignored us for another 10 minutes. They didn't tell us how long the next appointment would be. I think one of their clients may have had lice. They were selling a lice shampoo and instructing the parent how to apply it and pointed to the boy's scalp. After we got up left. No one followed us or attempted to ask why we were leaving. I know lice is common among children but it can be highly contagious. This was my perception of the situation and I cannot say for a fact the child had lice. And although I have no information regarding their sanitary/hygiene procedures, I personally did not feel comfortable having my child's hair cut there afterward. We chose to leave. Finally, their prices were expensive in my opinion. For their ""supreme haircut"" it was 18.95 not including tax or trip. I took my child to a salon and paid $30. For 12 dollars more, my child received great customer service and had their hair cut by a stylist with shampoo and rinse.",negative
"Not recommended, took both my kids here, my son's haircut went well however the lady that cut my daughters hair was terrible, super lazy couldn't even put her little locks into a ponytail.... She had the nerve to ask me to do it, which I actually did end up fixing it anyways.... Very disappointing",negative
"We are new to the area and I went here to get my sons hair cut. He is 2 and back home I would take him to a similar place because he would sit still since there are toys and animals to sit on and she trimmed his hair just right. The lady was super friendly with my son here- blew bubbles, talked silly to him etc. great. But he cut. Looked fine there because she put gel in it and slicked it back plus he would no longer sit still. When I got home my husband asked who put a bowl on his head. He was right. Terrible cut. Uneven bangs. blah. And the lady was kind of pushy, very friendly, but pushy with her products. My two year old does not need gel or spray. Won't be back :/",negative
"The person who used to cut our children's hair has left. I think her name was Shawna? Shawna was amazing. She was personable, gentle and understanding of my sons' needs, and she always gave great hair cuts. Shawna please tell us where you are! Our last two visits to Cool Cuts 4 Kids were not good experiences. The two ladies who work there now are unprofessional. One woman kept talking with the other about her very personal health issues in front of my children which they had all kinds of questions about later. The other lady is rude and handles the boys roughly while speaking in a fake sweet voice. One time she even told my sensitive son that he needs to be tougher. The rude lady does not know how to operate their gaming systems which is the only reason why my sons were willing to get their hair cut there; therefore now that Shawna is gone, the games were the only reason I was willing to drive 20min and pay for a mediocre haircut there. One of my sons was in tears when we got home after the last cut because the hair dresser butchered his hair so badly. He gets upset everytime he looks in the mirror and is refusing to ever get his haircut again. Obviously, we won't be back.",negative
"The woman who usually cuts our child's hair wasn't there and the person who seemed to be in charge was SO abrasive. I knew before the cut started that this would be a mistake. Our child has Down Syndrome and can be a handful, but the more-experienced stylist was always so good with him and did such a fantastic job. I'll complete the haircut myself! After coming here for years, we will be going elsewhere. We were driving half an hour to come here, but would drive an hour for better service and understanding.",negative
"The first time I took my son here, he had gotten a really bad cut elsewhere. Not only did they fix his bad haircut, but were great with him. We came today ten minutes before the closed and were in and out with a great haircut. Thanks for being great with the little ones!!!!!",positive
"Woman working on Saturday 8/8/15 was incredibly unprofessional, abrasive, and rude. Still, My daughter and I waited for 10 minutes. We left when we overheard her being rude to another client. We'll never go back.",negative
The girl at the front desk was rude and unprofessional! We walked out and didn't get a haircut for my daughter. She had an attitude right when we walked in. Will not be going back. First impression was terrible!,negative
"I took my daughter here to get her hair cut, we were a walk in bad had very little time but she had been begging for months to get a cut so I figured fine!! Her hair is down to her bum and we wanted a cute shoulder length Bob the woman who did her hair wasn't very pleasant, she kept telling me she couldn't really cut her without washing it which is false, 1st use a spray bottle and if this was the case don't offer a cut price that does not include the wash, she kept going on and on until I was like ""fine"" just to shut her up, I should have just left at that point bc my stylist dry cuts my hair all the time to make sure it's stays the length I want so I should have known she would be inadequate!!! After everything was said and done my daughter had waist length hair basically just chopped to her shoulders, I asked for layers there were none, I asked for a bob...there wasn't one!!! I could have saved $22 dollars and dos that hack job myself ended up taking my crying butt and my crying daughters butt across town to an actual stylist at Madisons and have them fix it! They did bc they are amazing and I went across town to request my money back only to be told the manager has to be the one to authorize and that the manager was gone and the manager was the woman who had butchered my daughters hair and then I was told that if I had a problem she could have fixed it (um yeah right like I would let anyone else there touch her)Yes the place is cute but this girl had zero hair cutting abilities!!! Beware talent is lacking and prices are high!!!",negative
"This is an awesome place to get your child's hair cut. My ten year old son was given a very vesitile, cool cut.Yasmine is a wonderful stylist who truly cares.",positive
Awesome place to take your child for his or her first hair cut. the guy who cut my 1 yr olds hair was great with kids. they have cute seats for the kids to sit in and play disney movies to keep them occupied.,positive
"We love this place. We went a few months ago for my son's first hair cut and they were very accommodating with us wanting to keep as much of his hair as possible, even with it being a Sunday they were very patient. I came back last week to get my handsome guy a trim and was more than blown away. His stylist was Jazmine. She was very friendly and kept her attention on Declan the whole time. I could go to any kid based salon, but I will continue to bring him here because of their customer service.",positive
"Have been to other locations before and loved it, so I thought I would try this one. My son has a different hairstyle than most boys (surfer shag type) and MANY hairstylists have messed it up tragically before, so when I called to make an appt, I asked who would be best to cut his hair......considering they had NO idea what I was talking about, I won't be risking trying them out.",negative
The atmosphere is perfect for kids and the service and actual hair cut are always exceptional. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND making an appointment before coming in. They are always busy! My kids love the little car chairs and all of the stylists use words that kids can understand. They also have awesome hair products for kids as well as toys to bribe or reward!,positive
"As soon as we got here, I knew...this was a fun place for kids. Lots of toys, movies, video games. I had my 4 year old son and my 18 month old daughter (her first haircut) and we got a super nice lady who made the experience so easy for my little girl. She did an amazing job and we got a little memento of her first haircut. I highly recommend this place!",positive
"Time flies when you're having fun...2 years hence and I still take the sparkly offspring here. Other reviewer is absolutely correct, especially on the weekend, if you don't have an appointment you'll have a serious wait. I tend to go weekdays after work and its relatively quiet. Even then, I call for the appointment first. Its still a very fine hair cut and I know what to expect - the goob seems to enjoy the fact that he can play Sonic while his head is otherwise engaged. If we went more often I'd probably rethink the expense because it is $17.95 plus tip. For now, its worth it.",positive
After trying to color my hair myself I found Copectic and Marie! Marie is fabulous and listened to what I wanted to do and the end result was amazing!! The salon is very comfortable and has a great feel to it! Beverages and snacks are offered as well. They do all kinds of hair treatments as I have noticed quite a lot of fabulous before and afters! Below is a photo of my freshly colored hair. Love the multi dimension colors in it! Perfect every time! Try Marie and you won't be disappointed!,positive
"Love this place! First time there yesterday - Jessica was a good listener, she made great suggestions, and I ended up with a fabulous haircut, color that I love and subtle balayage highlights that really upped the style quotient for my hair. Will definitely be back.",positive
Absolutely loved this place!!!!! Everyone was super friendly and welcoming. I was a new customer from out of state and they got me in that day!! I told Alexis (my stylist) what I wanted and she did it perfectly!!!! She had a great personality:) I would highly recommend this place to any and everyone!!!!,positive
"I only get my hair cut at Copacetic. I currently live in Phoenix, AZ and as soon as I know when I am coming back to Pittsburgh I immediately call to schedule an appointment with Missy. Missy is fantastic and so great. I always leave the salon happy and am never disappointed. The lounge is very relaxing and not loud, so you are able to relax and enjoy the pampering. Every stylist at Copacetic is very welcoming and friendly, makes you feel at ease. I highly recommend going to Copacetic to get your hair done.",positive
"I recently moved to the North Hills and desperately needed a new hair salon. I made an appointment with Mallory for a cut and balayage and she nailed it. Prices were great, space is amazing and everyone there was so friendly. I've definitely found my new spot!",positive
Love the staff and location. Missy has been doing my hair for years. I am a blonde and A LOT of people can not get the color right but she does every time. The salon is super cute and atmosphere is relaxing with refreshments. Highly recommend anyone looking for a new stylist as the entire staff is great!,positive
"I went there because of the high reviews. The girl who did my hair was super sweet but turned it that brassy gold shade of blonde that I hate even after showing pictures of what I wanted (very light soft blonde). I was there all afternoon into the evening and it still was not what I wanted. Had to go to another salon to have it fixed although they offered to fix it, I was too afraid. Will be going back to my girl from home who charges 1/4 the price.",negative
All I have to say is Valeria is DA BOMB!!! She is absolutely amazing. I am working through a color correction and she has done an amazing job. She is pragmatic and makes sure to communicate expectations and potential issues. She is thorough and works amazingly well under pressure of the unknown of color corrections. Everyone at the salon is amazing.,positive
"I came into this salon with a recommendation to see Missy, however due to the holiday I was put in to see Caroline. The receptionist spoke highly of her ability to do highlights. I needed a slightly tacky highlighting job fixed up, and she most definitely delivered. My color looks amazing, my cut looks amazing, and everyone in the salon was very chatty and friendly. I'm so excited to have found my new salon. Plus they have a dog in the salon so I really don't know what more you could ask for!",positive
I had my hair cut and balayage by Marie a couple weeks ago. I'm absolutely in love with the color! She did an amazing job blending so it looks natural and vibrant. She works meticulously and was so sweet and accommodating even when my appt ran long. Highly recommend this salon and Marie!,positive
"Yesterday I had my hair done by Valarie. It was my first time to the salon! I had an awful experience at another salon in the area and had bad highlights and over processed hair. Valarie took on the challenge. We talked about what I wanted and what was realistic. She is a magician! She took the time, listened to me and fixed my hair to EXACTLY what I wanted! This is best cut and color I have ever had. My hair is smooth, shiny and healthy feeling. I have gone to a few of the salons in the North Hills and Copacetic is 10x better than the rest. My hair was a disaster and now it's exactly how I wished it would be! I would ABSOLUTELY recommend anyone in PGH to give them a try. You will be so glad you did. They are tucked in Pines plaza and if you blink you'll miss them. When you walk in the place is so cool looking, very chill and modern. All the stylists are friendly and every customer I saw around me looked awesome when they were done! They offer you beverages and ask you frequently if you're comfortable. Restrooms are very clean and pretty (that's a huge plus in my book, i'm weird) Love this place, love the stylists! Oh and Eddie is so adorable!!! I will keep coming back for the rest of forever.",positive
"This is easily my favorite salon!! The atmosphere is so positive, the workers are so friendly, and I LOVE my hair stylist! Ask for Caroline- she does an AMAZING job!",positive
"I would give this salon a 5 plus. After reading a number of the reviews on Yelp, I decided to make an appointment with Kim. She is an amazing stylist with a wealth of knowledge and skills regarding color and hair care! I am so pleased my hair and I am most appreciative of the professional and friendly environment! This is a very difficult standard to achieve. Definitely returning to Kim!",positive
"This salon looks so small tucked in off of Perry Hwy. As I walked in, I was greeted by an adorable puppy basking in the sun. The decor and atmosphere made me feel like I was at a relaxing lounge. Especially, the complimentary wine and beer! I loved all the fresh plants, the set up and decor of the salon, such a relaxing atmosphere! I came in with a few pictures, but overall pretty open to ideas. My hair was honestly a mess and needed a lot of love! It was my first time with Jess and I was overly impressed! She did a fantastic job, I was actually looking at my hair today (a little over a week later) and it still looks fabulous. Highly recommended and truly feel like I've found my salon.",positive
"Copacetic... where shall I begin? It's a true rarity these days to find a person with talent that exudes so much passion for their art. So it's only fair that I share my experience with this salon. My stylist who I had went to for years had to start limiting her hours so needless to say we unfortunately had opposite schedules and I needed to find a new salon quickly! Immediately, following the break up my search for a hair queen started. Letting someone else touch my hair was very scary for me... Mostly because I'm blonde and all you other light haired girls out there know that blonde can turn to orange and/ or break off with a quickness if the stylist isn't knowledgeable. So I hopped on social media to see what I could find... after all pictures don't lie and I needed physical proof that my hair wasn't going to fall out! The pictures of her before and after's were on point and exceptionally beautiful. So of course I made an appointment. I HAVEN'T LOOKED BACK SINCE! I should add that I have an autoimmune disease which has caused me to lose a lot of hair so to say that my hair is thinning would be an understatement. Nikki James installs my hair extensions and does my color monthly and I'm grateful to have her in my life. I'm not ashamed to say that my hair was and still is a huge part of my life ... it's a shallow world we live in and I don't see that changing anytime soon. So that being said, when I started to lose my hair I lost a part of my identity which Nikki helped to restore. Thank you Copacetic for being a master of your craft and for cosmetically and psychologically transforming self-images.",positive
"What an amazing salon run by professional, talented, amazing women! I have been going to Missy for the past 14 years and am always pleased with what she does! Copacetic is a beautiful salon in a great location with a friendly, welcoming, and knowledgeable staff. What more could you ask for? :-)",positive
"Love love love! I can't say enough good things. Missy and Nikki have made a place where you feel at home. I'm so proud of these ladies and can't wait to see what great things are in their future. Missy and I have essentially grown up together. Whether I want a pixie with platinum streaks or long flowing locks, I always walk out looking like my mane belongs in a magazine. I'm so happy that these 2 and their staff have a place where we can all be friends and chat it up and have a fun and relaxing day.",positive
"LOVE Copacetic Beauty Lounge! I went to Nikki shortly after another stylist from a different salon turned my ashy blonde hair into a copper nightmare. I left CBL with the most beautiful color correction! Nikki really spent her time ensuring that my hair was processed correctly, and she sought input from fellow co-workers which I really liked, feeling as though I had a whole team of stylists on my side to make sure that locks came out perfectly for my style and taste. On top of the amazing service and staff, the salon itself is very welcoming and easy going, which had me thinking the whole time that everything sure is ""Copacetic.""",positive
I absolutely love getting my hair done here! Beautiful and calming environment with the funnest stylists who do killer work. I go to Nikki but know that all of the stylists equip their clients with hot looks. They pay extra attention to who you are and really make you feel like a valuable client. Wouldn't go anywhere else!,positive
"I would recommend Copacetic to anyone and everyone! All of the employees are so friendly and greet you with a smile. Nikki has been my stylist for years and she's fantastic! I never know what to do with my hair so I usually let her take the reins. I always leave the salon feeling fresh, fabulous, and beautiful! Copacetic is #1!",positive
"Missy has been doing my hair for years and this is the third place I have followed her to and probably final because she's a co-owner now:) I feel so strongly about the work they do that I gladly make the trek from the opposite side of town. It's so worth it. I continue to get the fantastic color work done in an amazing salon that truly is only there to make you look like your best self. I don't trust anyone else but Missy, though I have seen the talent they have procured for this new salon and I am impressed. I have to say I would feel comfortable with any of the staff--and I am super picky about color. The space is bright, open, relaxing, and they care very much about your experience there. Beverages, snacks, you name it, it's there for you to enjoy during your services. Everything about this salon is wonderful, from the staff to the amenities, you'll love it.",positive
"Whether you're looking for a traditional haircut and style or something more non-traditional, the stylists at this salon will delight you! I'm watching a lady go blonde on my left, a lady go black with gorgeous dark blue highlights on my right, and I'm going bright red. Behind me is a child getting her hair cut and a gentleman just exited with a new, very dapper looking haircut. Come check them out. Regardless of the style you're seeking, they can accomodate. (Except for maybe combovers...I don't know if they do those.) If you want to go red, see Missy. She's the best!",positive
"This salon is brand spanking new and located in Pines Plaza along Perry Highway. I came across Copacetic after hearing that my go-to stylist would be taking her talents here. I was able to book an appointment for their opening week and loved everything about my visit! The salon is beautifully decorated in a mix of modern and rustic pieces, with comfy chairs to wait in, beverages to help you pass the time (water, coffee, wine, beer), as well as an open industrial atmosphere. My stylist, Kim, proved why she's my favorite and one of the best in the biz - she gave me an amazing haircut and put my mind at ease before snipping and styling me into a fantastic shoulder-length cut. Their prices are great, the staff is excellent and refined at what they do, and the environment is clean, cool, and comfortable. If you're looking for a change of scenery or an excuse to check out a new salon, you'll be in great hands at Copacetic!",positive
"new location right across the street. It's better! .. my minus one star is to advise anyone who is special ordering anything from them- to go elsewhere. My salon kit took 4 months to come in and a simple paul Mitchell hairspray my client wanted- STILL hasn't came in (5 months ago!) I called and asked about it and they said if we haven't called you, it hasn't came in... so just go to another location for special orders.. or by the time you wait you'll find it elsewhere",positive
This was my favorite location but I just drove there the other day and they closed down :(. If they relocated in Glendale someone please let me know!,positive
"My go to spot for all my salon supply needs. Great prices, always great specials going on and if they don't have it, they'll order it for you!! These gals that work there are awesome and informative as well.",positive
I just moved to Arizona and I do hair for a living I am so glad that there's a Cosmoprof close to my house!!!! Omg even though this Cosmo prof is in a super dead center it doesn't matter they have everything I need.. Girls who work here are so super attentive they're so nice and very helpful with everything.,positive
Mary and the staff here are great willing to help answer any questions you might have. That is why I will drive 40 miles out of my way to this beauty supply store for the great customer service.,positive
Had great friendly service from Epsy today! Lots of great sales and ideas for clients Christmas gifts. Thanks Cosmoprof!,positive
"I absolutely love this location! I've even switched a few things I use from other beauty supplies to do the majority of my shopping here, the staff is always friendly and professional, and are very knowledgable, and I never have had any issues with returning or exchanging an item. I love shopping here.",positive
"Staff was super friendly and knowledgable. Easy to find and plenty of parking. Their selection was a little low as they were out of a few of the products we were looking for. Maybe it's because it was the holiday? Not sure, but if you're looking for something specific, I would suggest calling first.",positive
"I love this place. They always have what I need and they're so friendly and polite. They are only one of the places I go to for nail supplies, but I definitely enjoy coming here. Management is always knowledgable and if they DONT know something, they make sure they get you the answer ASAP",positive
"This is by far the very worst place to go for a haircut,I took my son back after we already had a horrible experience,when his dad brought him home last night after his visit with Jazzmon I was furious,I immediately tried to call a manger at the store and at 130 pm the next afternoon I'm still unable to reach a manager..My sons hair is so hacked he didn't go to school today..Come on ppl hire some real hair dressers,stop scraping at the bottom of the barrel for ur employees once the hair comes off it's not like u can glue it back on..",negative
My 5 year old daughter got her first hair cut for kindergarten. We wanted to donate her hair. After a friend searched forever for a place that could cut hair to the requirements we came across Cost Cuters. All the staff was super knowledgeable about the process and made everything go smoothly. Everyone was friendly and had the patience to work with little ones that constantly move during their hair cut. My daughter cut off 18 inches of hair and got an adorable long bob hair cut for her first day of school and wigs for kids got 18 inches of hair donation. Thanks to the staff for helping my daughters first hair cut memorable. If you are looking for a place to cut for hair donations I defitinely recommend this Cost Cutters for the cut process.,positive
"As I have just moved to Phoenix and haven't had time to scout out a hairstylist, when I needed a haircut for an upcoming trip I got on Yelp and located the nearest salon. I was a bit nervous about what I would get for $14.50, but it's just hair and mine grows back with the quickness. I called, made an appointment and a couple hours later I was in the chair. Now I for one am not good at giving direction. I know what I want, but articulating it can be a bit of a challenge so I just give some guidance and tell them to do what they think will look good... again, it's just hair. I did just that with Alexis and it was like she read my mind. She used a razor vs clippers, which I prefer, and she really got in there and went to work on the layers. She did an AMAZING job and I will definitely be back for upkeep.",positive
"I went today to get a haircut, however before going to this place. Of course I check the reviews. I seen many amazing reviews on Michelle! So I made sure to make an appointment with her. Let me just tell you how great she was. First off she took her time with my haircut which is a HUGE deal to me, she was also very friendly and we had good conversation. I am very picky with who touches my hair. Next time I get my hair colored in 4-5 weeks I'll be having Michelle do it for me:) if you want great service and someone who takes their time with your hair. Ask for Michelle:)",positive
I got my haircut from Michelle today! She took her time and concentrated on my hair the entire time. My hair is perfect and so much better than it was! I have never had anyone (even someone who costs $60) take that much time and really perfect my hair. I have not found one person who has been as good as my girl in Colorado and its been 4 years and Michelle is even better! I will go back all the time.,positive
"I never knew this place was right around the corner from me until I saw the reviews on Yelp! I made an appointment with Michelle to get my hair cut and highlighted. She was great! It took a couple hours to get my hair done, but it was worth it. She did an amazing job. I highly recommend her!",positive
I don't know why I never looked at this location before but thanks to the yelp reviews I decided to give it a try for a little trim. I was welcomed by Lindsay who took my information and I had a 20 minute wait but thankfully they have a lot of magazines :) Lindsay did a great job of listening to what I wanted. She took off exactly what I asked for and it looked a million times better than I had anticipated. The haircut and wash came out to be around $16 and that was the best haircut I've had in a long time that was cheaper than my normal $60 cut. I appreciate Lindsay and will definitely be back. I appreciate that she was OK with me being not so chatty but she was extremely friendly and chatty with the person before me. Sometimes I just want to zone out when somebody's playing with my hair :) Thank you :),positive
Michelle is an amazing amazing at her job. She can do whatever you want from the latest hair cuts and dye jobs to the traditional looks. I call a head to make sure she is open to do my cuts. The saying you get what you pay for is not unilateral with hair. I have gone to some of the 'higher' end places and been very disappointed with the finished product. It all about the stylist and this place has a gem of one.,positive
I used to go to a VERY expensive salon. It cost about $55 for a haircut. Now I go to Michelle at this Cost Cutters. She is amazing and at less than $15 for a haircut...well worth it! I have my hair double processed for color and what would have cost between $200 and 300 at the other place costs me around $80 here and I have very long hair! Michelle is very professional and extremely nice. I don't know if I would come to someone different but as long as she's here I will be a customer.,positive
"I saw this today on Dear Abby... This is how I feel when I get my hair cut at Cost Cutters. Take a minute to read it. DEAR ABBY: I feel that the longer you go to the same hairdresser, the more she takes you for granted. The service gets worse. When I have shared this opinion with some of her other clients, they agreed. The salon does not have a receptionist. Whoever is there just picks up the phone, whether the stylist is working on a customer or not. During my last haircut, which usually lasts about half an hour, she answered the phone six times. I pay for my appointment, and it should be at least relaxing. Have your readers had the same experience? -- MIKE IN NEW YORK DEAR MIKE: I'm sure some of them have, unless they told the stylist they're using they don't like being treated that way. So speak up. As a paying customer, it is your privilege.",negative
"I've been going to this Cost Cutters for close to two years. I was referred by a friend whose whole family has been going for years. I love the staff! So friendly, and so willing to help. Yes, they get busy, because they are so good. I always schedule ahead and never have a problem getting in. Highly recommend for cut and color!",positive
Have been having Lisa cut my hair She is great as she listens to me and is interested in what kind of style I'm looking for When I leave I'm always happy She has a personality that makes her customers feel so special Love her,positive
"Myself, my mom, and my sister all come here for our cuts and color and all the ladies here are fantastic! I have gotten my hair done by Lindsay and Michelle and they're so sweet, fun to talk to, and most importantly they are great with me hair! I just worked with Michelle before this review and she was gentle washing my hair, she was able to answer my questions about staying my bangs, and cut my hair exactly as I wanted! She recommended thickening shampoo and conditioner from Big Sexy Hair that works great and volumizes my hair. I've paid a lot of money at high ends salons and this place treats me the same and does just as good of a job for a much cheaper price. I highly recommend it!",positive
I always have a good time when I go to this shop! I've had almost all the girls cut my hair and they always do a great job!,positive
I was very unsatisfied with the service I received. They were rude and acted like it was killing them to simply cut my hair. I know I have long but seriously it's thin! I didn't have any coloring done and my hair naturally drys straight. I will never becoming back here. I asked the gentle men for just a half an inch he cut off three inches! I refuse to ever come back!!!!!!!!!!!! I can't believe the attitude he gave me after I told him I was not pleased with my hair cut!,negative
"I've been here before and I miss it so much!! I decided after having been buried by books, time consuming studying and perseverance to finish my education early that I need and require some tlc. I need Barbara and Markis!!!!! I can say I really love their services. They are amazing people!!! I highly recommend them!!!",positive
This is the best place I have ever been to. Without a doubt. My nails had been torn from a previous experience at a different salon and she took the time to explain what may have gone wrong at the previous salon and how she was going to fix it. I'm so blown away by the amazing customer service as well as my perfectly shaped and polished acrylics. I cannot wait to go back!,positive
"I love the ladies here! Ileana and Barbara were here when my friend and I came close to ""last call"". They were so friendly and quite the characters! I loved the fact that when we were came there was one other lady receiving a pedicure was a long time regular of this salon. It was a true gift to experience the interaction between these three. They made us both feel right at home and we ended up mumbling to each other ""I love them!!!"" At least a few times. Their personalities really sold them! If I didn't live in Seattle I would get a membership Right Now!!! And, to top of this amazing-ness off, they did GREAT work. Spectacular work. A perfectly dreamy salon, indeed.",positive
The entire team at Creating Magic Salon are Outstanding! I had a Ladies Night Mani/Pedi and it was EXCELLENT! We will definitely be back!!! Plus they have really cute jewelry!,positive
This is the go to place for nails. Gaylee has so much passion for her practice that it really shows in the creative designs and styles. She can deliver - make an appointment and you will be amazed. Awesome staff and many options for nails!!!,positive
DONT EVER GO TO THIS PLACE!! Gaylee cut up my cuticles so badly- she didn't even do the cuticles before she applied the gel polish. I was in pain - throbbing for weeks after going to her! Finally they healed up and now I found out that I have a bacterial infection from a nail salon. I'm telling you and warning you not to go here. The business owner's response BTW- is responding to a different client- My name is not Jenny and the dates she references are not accurate- I was there on a different date altogether. THIS TELLS ME THAT OTHER PEOPLE ARE EXPERIENCING THE SAME THING!!,negative
"I will never go anywhere else for my nails - I found this salon thanks to Yelp in a desperate search for a salon that would do acrylics on toes, I lost mine hiking and have been beyond self conscious since and hadn't gone to get a pedicure since because I was too embarrassed (they look gnarly while coming back). I spoke with Barbara when making my appointment and she was super sweet and said they'd take a look and see what they could do. Gaylee was my girl for my appointment and I have NEVER ever ever had someone be as personable and detail oriented doing a mani/pedi as this lovely girl. I can't say enough great things about her - all of my self consciousness went out the window as she did her thing and made my tootsies look like normal, any pain I had from my nails being weird she took care of like a nurse and when the polish I had picked was low, she went and grabbed a couple of colors to mix so I could have the one I had originally picked. I got a gel mani too and love it. Barbara was super sweet in person and joined in our conversation. The whole experience was beyond comfortable and I felt like i was just hanging out with friends - I also teared up on the way out because of how great/normal my toes looked. I'm forever grateful to these ladies and will be a lifelong customer.",positive
"Carol Kelly is hands down the most knowledgable and talented aesthetician I've ever gone too! I've been seeing her for years and my skin has never felt or looked better. She is honest about what products you need and never pushes anything on you. She has changed my skin to wear I don't wear foundation anymore. Hallelujah!!! I wear my sunscreen everyday and a very light powder. I constantly learn more about my skin. She also waxes me. She uses a wax with no strips. The wax hardens and she gently pulls it away. I always use to hate getting my brows done because I would breakout around then after and be red for days. Granted I have very sensitive skin but with carol all my red is gone by the next day! I ca also get my waxing and facial all done in one sitting which is awesome. I trust her 150% with anything she advises or tells me. May I also say that once says you are ready then you are going to die of happiness after getting a microdermabrasion. My skin literally glowed! It was baby bum smooth and everything. I'm telling you, if you want flawless skin then go to Carol Kelly. She is the sweetest!!",positive
"Stumbled upon this nail salon the other day and decided to try a manicure..decent priced and was very pleased with the ""over the top"" customer service!!! Very friendly environment!! I was extremely impressed with the cleanliness of the salon as Well which i feel is quite noteworthy..i would definitely go here again!!!",positive
"Love this salon so much! Very clean and everyone is super friendly. I think the prices are fair - you're paying for salon quality work with pros. I think they take walk ins but I usually call ahead. I've never had my hair done here but my mani pedis are always perfect. They don't use those cuticle clippers that can can cut you or those feet shaver things. Everything is sanitized and non-scary. I always get solid colors on my nails but someday I'll have to get some nail art, the pictures I've seen are so impressive!",positive
"I found the reviews on yelp so helpful when selecting this salon to get my nails done. I called yesterday morning for a gel mani and someone answered the phone right away and they scheduled me in for later that day. Ileana did my nails and she's great! Super friendly, very professional, and my nails look awesome :) I plan to come here often.",positive
I usually have trouble getting my nails done well because my nail beds are pretty small. Barbara did an awesome job on my very simple but beautiful acrylic overlays. The shop is beautiful and very clean. The staff was super courteous and friendly. I will definitely keep going back.,positive
New employee took two hours to give me a pedicure. Very awkward experience. She was clumsy and I left with a smudged big toe. Fifty dollar pedicure disaster. It felt like a pedicure from a beauty school. Bummed.,negative
I have been coming to Barb at Creating Magic for months for my pedicures and manicures. She is awesome and ok couldn't be happier. I then met Carol and started seeing her for my eyebrows and eyelashes. Wonderful wonderful. Love these women.,positive
"Two stars are for the friendly staff and cleanliness. I was very disappointed in the pedicure I received. $56.00 and an hour later I left with poorly polished toes, the dark color I came in with wasn't completely removed. My heals are still cracked, there was no dead skin removed. One of my favorite parts of my weekly pedicure is the massage and was disappointed in that too. Perhaps nails and hair are their thing and that's why they have many good reviews. Don't waste your money here for a pedicure.",negative
"My mother-in-law and I walked in 30 minutes before close, in desperate need of new nails for the MIL. I was also trying to treat my mother-i-l. before she flew out the next day after her Christmas vacation with us. We had stumbled on Creating Magic by googling, ""Nails,"" in the iphone map. Barbara, the owner, greeted us and she knew that this would go past their closing time, but she agreed anyways. Barbara was very personable and did ""the best job,"" my mother-in-law, who has been getting her nails done religiously for 20+ years, as ever done. I liked the ""small local business feel."" The owner and her other salon employees were joking around and were very hospitable to us late comers. I don't get my nails done much, or frequent salons, for that matter, but I would consider getting some waxing, nails or highlights, just to go back! Thank you Barbara and friends!",positive
"I went in for the first time today for a pedicure with a MasterCard gift card I got for Christmas. I found them on Yelp, I was with Marisa & she was so professional & nice. Let me just say, I am so happy I found them! I already made an appointment for 4 weeks out. It's my new spot :)",positive
"We had a canceled flight with time to kill... Mani/pedi and a blow out were just what we needed! Staff was super friendly, my nails looked great and with a short uber/taxi, made it back for or flight in no time:)",positive
"I love this place! I went in today for the first time, got a 20% off discount because it was my first time and I ended up having Kaitlyn! She was awesome, she's hand paints all her art from a pretty butterfly to Audrey Hepburn ! She's freakin' amazing! The atmosphere is nice, very energetic and friendly. I love love LOVE it its amazing! I hands down recommend it!!",positive
Found an amazing stylist at this salon! Markis is precise and detail oriented and you always leave the salon with incredible looking hair. The salon is so clean and the staff is friendly and very hospitable. Great atmosphere. Great service. So happy I found a new salon! Thank you Markis!,positive
I had the most pleasant experience this morning for my manicure. I had been here once before for a fill and I was definitely pleased the first time but this time exceeded all my past experiences at any nail salon. My nail tech Iliana was fantastic! My nails look sooooooo great! The owner is always smiling and I was surprised that she had remembered me just from my very first visit. I have never had a nail salon where I look forward to seeing the people as much as my finished product. Great overall experience. Very clean no gross chemical smells and wonderful people. LOVE LOVE LOVE this place.,positive
"For a superb nail tech, go see Kaitlyn @ Creating Magic. She has done mani/pedi for me several times & does outstanding nail art-extremely creative! She's friendly-as is everyone @ this lovely shop. Give her a try - you won't regret it=)",positive
"My daughters and I went to see Laine for hair cuts today. She is a super star artist with hair! Each of us has very different hair-one daughter has very long (past her waist), straight, very thick hair, the other has medium length, super fine, wavy hair that likes to tangle, and I have (now) short, thick half straight half wavy hair with sparkle (I mean gray). So lots of textures and lengths to work with and Laine scored a 10 with each one. I wish I knew how to post photos here.",positive
"Awesome! My wife and I could not believe how professional and hospitable Creating Magic was. Barbara did my pedicure (mind-blowing) and Gaylee did my wife's mani-pedi (which she can't stop talking about!). Their work is amazing! But my favorite part of our experience here was that we has fun! It felt like we've come here all of our lives, and we were the oldest of friends. The whole staff truly have a connection that just reels you in with their teamwork and genuine affection toward one another. The lemon scrub with the Shea butter finish turned me into a whole new person. I sworn I could've done ballet after my pedicure, because my feet were on clouds when Barbara got through with my feet using those magic wands she calls hands. Yes, I said magic wands, because she did magic on me and turned my feet into butter! And don't get me started on Gaylee! My wife's nails and toes were done so perfect, you would think that it was a team of engineers who did them. But believe me, it was one person! I can't put in words how to describe the color and design of my wife's toenails. But my wife calls it luscious purple color highlight sparkle (she always splays her arms while saying it). Lol. Sounds amazing right?! That cause it is that amazing! The French tip Gaylee did on wife's hands were like none I've ever seen before. It's a smooth shade of white I have never seen before. I never even knew white had different shades until then. By the time we were done. We were sad to go. But, we were happy that my wife and I had found OUR fortress of solitude in Phoenix!",positive
"I was extremely pleased with my entire experience at Creating Magic. The entire staff was very friendly, and I was seen by my nail tech, Gaylee, promptly at my appointment time (they accept walk-ins, but I didn't want to take chances on a Saturday afternoon). I opted for the Creating Magic Pedicure (as my feet were in rough shape), and it was heavenly. I chose this pedicure because it incorporated everything I was looking for - dry file, foot soak, nail shaping, cuticle treamtment, callus remover, scrub, lotion, massage, and polish. I wanted a 'package' that would include these treatments, rather than having to do a bunch of add-ons. Gaylee did an excellent job with my calluses. She took off quite a bit but didn't leave them tender. The foot and leg massage were fabulous. Gaylee has a great attention to detail, and my feet are now ready for summer here in Phoenix. We also had a pleasant conversation during my pedicure, and I really enjoyed my experience here. The salon itself is bright and clean, and all of the staff are friendly and professional. They have everything that you want and nothing that you don't. I would highly recommend Creating Magic, and I plan on coming back soon!",positive
"AMAZING experience! I loved the atmosphere in the salon and everyone was so friendly! I felt as though it was filled with my family! Barbara, the owner, is so hospitable and professional! Ileana was the person who took care of me for my mani/pedi! Amazing work and very professional! Everything was so CLEAN!",positive
"Colleen is wonderful, attentive, approachable and honest. I searched a lot of reviews of different nail salons and made my choice based on them. Not only is the salon easy to find. It's super duper clean. I am going back! This place is worth the drive and no gimmicks here either. I love love love my pedi and mani. Have a great time choosing this salon.",positive
"I love this place!!!! I would not go anywhere else!!!! They are very clean, its bright and sunny in the salon and my nails always look fantastic.",positive
"I really enjoyed my mani/pedi today with Barbara. She is a very genuine person and I enjoyed the feel of the salon. The salon is still in the growth stage, but you can tell they take care of their customers and they are more about quality versus quantity. I will definitely return. Nice nails and nice people.",positive
This new salon is a gem. Super clean and very friendly staff. They are a full service nail salon with massage services. And best of all...I got 50% off my services as a new walk in client! My pedicure was awesome and I love my new acrylic nails. One of the best salon experiences I've had in a long time.,positive
"Autumn was the BEST! She worked on my roots and she took the best care of my hair. No more gray! Luv, luv her. I completely connected with her. See you soon Autumn!",negative
"This was the best service I've had since I've moved to Las vegas! My hair looked so amazing, it was shiney and styled so nicely. i didn't have to do my hair for 3 days after! I'm the only one, till now, who took the time to blow dry and style my hair correctly. Autum is friendly, quick, knowledgeable and easy to talk to. I'll be telling my friends all about her. Thanks Autum!",positive
Had Autumn do a color and cut on my hair last week. Great job and fast. She is the best. Watch out you other LV cutters and colorists... you have some real competition here!,positive
"Autumn is a great stylist and person, really makes you feel special and love my hair color so happy to have found her on groupon",positive
"Autumn has amazing knowledge with hair color and extensions! She is completely professional and educated in her skills with color, cut, highlights, & extensions. She is also certified in eyelash extensions in which are unique and incredibly beautiful!",positive
I was very impressed with my haircut. I came in on a rainy Saturday so there was no lineup. Everyone says it's the best haircut that I have had in years! The establishment is clean and bright. The only caveat is bring cash. I had to use the atm next door as they only take cash. Pricing is reasonable and starts at $21 for a mens basic cut which is what I paid for my undercut with part and fade. I am extremely happy and I will be back!,positive
"To the ladies: My husband Jack had his hair cut by Abe a month ago and said it was the best haircut he has ever received. I agree! Abe is professional, friendly and economical ( which is the icing on the cake!) . We HIGHLY recommend Abe for any man who cares about looking the best he can be. I just got off the phone with Abe to make an appointment for my husband before he returns to Toronto tomorrow and Abe treated me like family. We cannot say enough about Abe, all we can say is tell your husband, sons and every male you know in Calgary that this is hands down the best haircut in Calgary. Period. Toronto has nothing on Abe. See you in Sept when we are back in town Abe !",positive
"I'm new to Calgary and was looking for a barbershop. I went here and had a haircut with the 2nd barber and was not overly impressed. I gave the barber specific instructions to not take too much hair off a certain area of my head and to leave the other area shorter. He basically shaved the area that I asked to keep longer (in other words did the exact opposite of what I requested) and now it looks completely uneven. Not a bad environment and they were friendly enough though. At the end of the day it's just hair and it will grow back, but I'm going to have to let that hair grow out awhile and will likely go somewhere else next time.",negative
"These guys are fast, accurate and charge a fair price. My son got a haircut there today. The barber was very gentle and kind to my son, all the way home my son kept saying ""dad that's my new forever barber"". He's happy and I am happy, we will definitely be back.",positive
"Just got an amazing Fade from Abe, I can tell you this guy is a magician he knows how to work your hair and has an amazing talent I'm from California and I can tell you that Abe impressed me more than any barber I have been to down there! Definitely recommend checking them out if you haven't already they know what they're doing and their prices are very good",positive
"My son only wants to go there for haircuts! The guys that run the place are friendly and courteous. It is cash only, so be sure to remember that!",positive
"I don't send my kids anywhere for a haircut except Dalhousie barbershop. The barbers r amazing with kids, very funny, and the cuts are immaculate. Would recommend for anyone wanting a great haircut at a super great price!",positive
My husband has got curly hair so not every barber is able to get his hair right but here they gave him a great haircut within minutes. The staff were extremely friendly and welcoming too.,positive
"Despite some recent staff turnover and a small price increase (now $19 for a regular haircut, $17 for a buzz cut, cash only), this place keeps me coming back for a simple reason: it's as straightforward as it gets. You walk in (no reservations), you wait your turn if all three chairs are occupied, and then you get your haircut the way you like it.",positive
"No frills, just a good haircut for a low price. It's my new favourite spot after getting tired of paying a lot more for trendier places.",positive
"My hair is important but not so much that i worry about it. If I get a bad haircut, no big deal. It always grows back. That's why I go to chain barbers. And I found a decent one. Then....a buddy of mine recommended Dapper Dan's. It is the best haircut I've had in ages. His lines are super clean, my cut is even throughout, without a bunch of stray hairs or loppy cuts. Something i regularly put up with at any one of the other places I was going to. Dan's studio is a one person affair. That's why he can spend so much time giving you a great cut and style. He's trained and worked all over the place, so he has substantial experience with all hair textures, he can cut an expert flat top, shave skin fades, and do both old school and modern hair cuts. If you've ever had a flat top, you know it's not as simple as it seems. The 100 year old barber chair and his careful attention to detail make the experience all the more worthwhile. It's great that he takes appointments only, eliminating the need to walk in and wait 30 minutes like other places. He also does straight razor shaves. His hand is gently and he uses plenty of hot and cold towels and ointments to leave your skin feeling smooth and refreshed. The best cut you can get. And all this for a supremely reasonable price!",positive
"Dapper Dan is the best in the business! He pays attention to detail, and I highly recommend getting your haircut there. I live on the other side the valley, but make the drive to old town because of his work.",positive
Really appreciate the online booking and the fact that Dan sticks to the schedule. Didn't have to wait when it was my turn. Great haircut with obvious attention to detail.,positive
I've been looking for an amazing barber in the Scottsdale area for a while now and I'm glad I came across Dan. He's a super cool guy and knows what he is talking about. He takes pride in the work that he does and won't finish until you and him are both satisfied with the job that was done. Definitely gonna be my go to guy from here on out and I would recommend anyone I know to get their hair done by Dan.,positive
Great job. He was so thorough and took time to make sure all was perfect. Got a cut and a shave and the shave was a great experience with a warm towel to start. The whole treatment was superb,positive
Loved the online appointment booking and text message confirmation/reminders. Great haircut and beard trim! Dan was friendly and chatty without being overly so. Sometimes just some quiet is good. :) I spend a few months in PHX area every winter and I've finally found a place to get a great haircut when I'm there.,positive
"I have been going to Dan for about 2 years, and he gives a good haircut, which is the only reason this review isn't one star. The reason why I give him two stars is that he does not know how to run a business or treat his clients. Over the course of 2 years I've had about 30-40 appointments with him total, never missing or being late to one. In addition, I was one of his first clients when he left his previous barber shop, sticking with him as he started his new business. I recommended him to every guy I know and have sent multiple clients to him that are now regular customers. Last week, for the first time, I missed an appointment because of a matter that came up. Rather than give me the courtesy of a call or text, Dan decided to inform me that I would be charged extra on my next visit. He treated me like just another valueless customer who misses appointments left and right (piece of advice for Dan, a client who misses one appointment out of 40 is still a great client). Additionally, he used a derogatory racial slur when referencing me to another client, who then told me. I will not be going to Dan again. Dan does not know how to respect, treat, or value his clients, or how to run a business. If you want a quick haircut, he's a good choice, but if you want a barber to go to regularly, stay away.",negative
"One fear of moving to a new state is finding the right barber. Well, this is the first place I went to after moving to the area and let me tell you this place is top notch. Dapper Dan is the man. He really goes into detail about your cut. He takes his time and is careful with your cut. Great conversation also. I highly recommend going here for your next cut. Will be back soon!",positive
"Made an appointment with dapper dan for 10:20 am on Saturday February 4th. To respect the appointment and the ""master barber's"" time I arrived at 10:15am for the appointment. The quote on quote master barber had someone sitting in the chair when I arrived. I waited until 10:30 in the lobby and then left. As a consumer I will not reward a business who cannot keep an appointment with my time and money. Thanks ""dapper dan"" I guess I will go to cut throat barber shop.",negative
Found Dapper Dan after doing some research and since then he's moved to his own personal spot. Dapper Dan makes my man look good. He specializes in men's haircuts and also does beard trimming. My boyfriend loves the hot towel treatment on his beard and consistency in polished cuts. Dapper Dan has a small private suite within a collection of other stylists. He offers a man escape zone (so ladies- stay home). My boyfriend is really thankful I found Dapper Dan!,positive
"I've been getting my haircut by Dapper Dan for a few months now and I feel like I've struck gold. The guy definitely knows what he is doing. Very professional, consistent, and takes pride in his work. If you go to Dapper Dan you won't be disappointed.",positive
"Dan is the truth. I have a hard time finding someone who can actually cut my hair to a style that I like, and from the first time I saw Dan he was able to do that for me. Probably the best fade/cut that I've ever gotten and the service is top notch. I've now recommended him to multiple friends of mine who are now regular clients. Dan's cuts were so impressive that I now come in for a cut/shave combo and leave happy every time. If you're in Scottsdale or anywhere near and are looking for that old school treatment without all the extra fuss I definitely recommend you make an appointment ASAP.",positive
"Recent transplant from Boston, so the cut is important. No bullsh*t Dan is strait money team. Tried Cutthroat but their ""online"" booking is jankey. Hands down guy is the King of Cuts in the Southwest....Think I'm f*ckin with you; just know he was the top guy at Cutthroat...ask him...he's doing better...boom success. Bottom line guy is legit and brings the heat!",positive
"Coming from a person who's very picky about cuts, I can't emphasize enough the quality of Dan's work. He puts the extra effort most barbers don't put in, and he genuinely cares about his clients experience. From the classic cut to the straight edge shave, this guy is about as consistent as they come. If you're lookin for a professional cut, he's the man to see!!",positive
"I have been seeing Dan for a few months now getting my hair cut. Let me just start by saying he gives the best cut I have gotten in the area. On top of that, he goes out of his way to make you relaxed while you get your haircut, comfortable, good shave, all that you need after a long days work. I would recommend Dan any day to all of my friends, and will continue coming back here.",positive
"What can I say about Dapper Dan? Well I'm very picky and particular with my haircuts. I'm also very loyal once I find someone I like. I've only changed barbers/stylists a couple times and always after I or they moved. All that said I can whole heartedly say that Dapper Dan is one of the best! He has an eye for detail that you should expect in a barber and while he is very quick with his skills you know he's never rushing. Throw in a quiet environment to relax in, a hot towel treatment and old school vibrating shoulder massage and you really can't go wrong. So make an appointment, drop in and enjoy a great cut and maybe a cold one!",positive
I been going to Dapper Dan for months am glad I found this place he knows how to make it happen ! need a cut book you're appointment !! With Dapper Dan !,positive
Best cuts for sure with Dan. He is great at whatever style you're rockin' and listens to what you want. Dan takes the time to triple check your cut and you leave feeling fresh. Highly recommend booking a haircut with him.,positive
Dapper Dan was fantastic. I was traveling for work and was unable to go to my usual barber in SoCal. I found Dan and was immensely impressed. You won't be disappointed.,positive
"Dapper Dan is amazing! He's not afraid to spend time to make sure your cut looks perfect. Most other barbers try and get you in and out but DD truly cares about his work. I have sent several of my colleagues and friends to him and they all report the same and thank me for the referral. Solid work Dapper Dan, as a customer I truly appreciate how you handle us as people and not just a number!",positive
"Dapper Dan is for real. I was looking for a good barber since moving back to town but having little luck. I noticed one of my pals here recently had some really slick haircuts so I asked him who he's been going to and he delivered. Online appointment system was as easy as could be, I felt welcomed and comfortable from the moment I walked in. Everyone there seemed chill and Dan was really personable. Most importantly, the cut was probably the best haircut I've ever had. He really takes his time and does a superb job, providing you with the cut you came in for. Have no fear, this is the guy you're looking for.",positive
"Dapper Dan is the Man!!! I've searched for a long time for someone with his style and ability! I drive 2 hours one way every month just to get the best haircut of my life! If you're reading this, you're obviously looking for a great barber. Do yourself a favor and STOP LOOKING! Go find Dan and get a haircut! You're a mess!",positive
"Dapper Dan does a great job on my haircut, love the convenience of making an appointment and getting a quality cut, I usually get a taper and he's fantastic at them!",positive
"This guy is top notch, does nothing but the highest quality of work every time. Any type of cut he's got you covered. You won't be disappointed.",positive
Dan has been taking care of me for a while now. Honestly I don't know why people would go anywhere else. The time he takes which each cut is extremely professional and refreshing. He is truly dedicated to getting every detail right and to exactly what you want. I would come here even if I lived an hour away. Highly recommended.,positive
"Dapper Dan does a great job. You can tell he takes pride in his work, and his craft, and is looking to provide a great, professional cut. Got a great haircut. I would definitely recommend Dapper Dan to anybody.",positive
"I've been seeing Dapper Dan for about 7 months now on a weekly basis. The man always makes sure my hair looks great and goes above and beyond on his tips and details of the cut. If you're looking for a fresh cut and consistency, he's the man!",positive
"Dapper Dan is great. He has a good feel for the characteristics of hair and how it behaves when cut different ways. Easy to talk to when discussing what you want. Pays very close attention to detail to make sure the cut is of high quality. As mentioned in other reviews, quality of cut is very consistent.",positive
By far the cleanest and freshest cut I've ever received! A meticulous barber who pays attention to detail! Dapper Dan is the guy to see! You won't be disappointed!,positive
Dapper Dan gives a serious hair cut. Capable of anything!!! I won't go any where else. He pays attention to detail and knows exactly what he's doing. Do yourself a favor and go to Dapper Dan he is the man!!!,positive
"Esha is so sweet and quick, got my lashes done for the first time, mine you I have the most sensitive skin, eyes, and it came out beautiful. Definitely recommend for eyelash service",positive
"Milly, the threading tech at this place brought my eyebrows back to life!! I have been getting my eyebrows threaded for years now and there has been many occasions where they leave my eyebrows completely botched. I recommend this place. It is far, but definitely worth the drive!",positive
The service here at the charleston location was amazing. Had my lashes done for the first time and extremely happy with the my new lashes!!! Also had my eyebrows threaded Esha did a remarkable job!!! Highly recommend this place!!!,positive
"ive been getting my full face threaded for almost 5 years. ive recently moved here to vegas and needed a new place. Esha was fantastic. she was kind and welcoming. she was light handed and quick. AND she naturally went to clean up my nose. in all these years, ive always had to request this from others (except the girl who first offered it to me). there were no strong smells in the location. it was a small clean location. take the stairs on either side of the building or the elevator on the far right.",positive
"I would suggest from my experience do not waste your money here, I bought a Groupon at this place then called to schedule the appointment. They said the stylist doesn't work there they are only rent out each stall separately the receptionist didn't even know the name of the stylist. It seemed like a real scam I would not spend my money at this place. I told the lady it has their name and addresses on it and she said it doesn't matter, go get your money back. They really did not seem to care. Awful customer service, definitely not the kind of place I am looking for in a business.",negative
"Awesome service, really like eyebrows and threading technique. Pleasant environment best place in town. Eyebrows tinting, henna tattoos,etc",positive
"This is the only place where I get my eyebrows done, always get them threaded and tinted and they always look amazing. Esha and her daughter they both make a great job!",positive
I am very disappointed with the lash extensions I got from Esha at this Deep Beauty Spa location. The next day they all fell out. What?! She said they would last for weeks. But they didn't even last 24 hours. Maybe the glue is bad? I wish I didn't waste my time and money there. I tried calling but she never picks up the phone. It always goes to voicemail. I suggest you stay away from this place.,negative
Amazing service and amazing location!! I visit their other locations to but this is my go to place to get my eyebrows in place. Absolutely amazing customer service!!!!,positive
Very helpful and friendly and would highly recommend this place! She reshaped my eyebrows and gave me instructions on how to care for them.,positive
I was only going to get to get my eyebrows threaded but I saw that the eyebrows tinting was only $25 and I wanted to try it out. She told me to go black but I got scared that it will be too dark so I got dark brown instead. It looks really natural and she did it perfectly according to the shape of my eyebrows and face. Very happy with the result. Will definitely come back!!! :),positive
"Moved to Vegas from CA a couple months back and my eyebrows had been crazy since, definitely missing my girl in CA. Out of desperation I found Esha on Yelp and she didn't disappoint, she even managed to keep my pathetic arches visible. Super sweet and quick, very happy with the outcome.",positive
"This eyebrow threading experience was excellent. It was comfortable, quick, thorough and very pleasant. The only downside is that I can only use the ""$7 for $15 of service"" deal once but such is the world of business and profitability. Overall a great experience at a service provider that I will use again.",positive
"I redeemed a Yelp deal here last minute and glad I did! This eyebrow bar is located in a large complex, however the room Esha, the artist, rents the space is comfortable and cute. I had eyebrow threading and tint done. Naturally, I have thin and light eyebrows...I felt by the time she was done they were the opposite! Improved! She did not over pluck and managed to define a better shape. She used a black tint on my brows. When she was done the color came out looking natural. I recommend this place and plan to return for both threading and tint! I may even try the henna tattoos, as she does them there as well!",positive
"Used the yelp deal, and I am so happy that I found this place. The owner is very efficient and knows what she is doing. Will definitely go back.",positive
I found this place on Yelp I've been looking for years for a place that will do eyebrow tint. This place Is amazing and customer service is great. I would recommend this place to everyone from now on.,positive
I found this place from yelp. I called the number that is listed here and I initially thought they were no longer in business because it was just a generic cell phone voicemail but she called me back about 30 minutes later. She did say that she takes walk-ins until 5:00 pm and after that is by appointment only so that's something to keep in mind. Esha did a fantastic job on my out of control brows. It seems like the tread she uses is a thinner gage that what I've had used on me in the past but I barely felt it while she was doing it plus it didn't look like I got punched in the eye after she was done. Looks like I found my new eyebrow girl.,positive
Looking for a eyebrow threading place well look no further! I decided to give this place a try and I've never been happier! Esha is so professional and knows how to thread. This place is so clean and very cute. I'm so happy I never have to go anywhere else.,positive
"This is the best eyebrow threading in Las Vegas. I have been to a couple of places because I prefer threading over waxing, but what made me crazy is I felt like there wasn't any privacy. If you go to this location, you will probably see Esha, she owns the business and does the threading. You will walk into a private room where you can have whatever part of your face threaded without an audience. Esha also gets every little bit of hair. She really cares and she knows what she is doing. She even gave me a bottle of the lovely rose water she sprays on your face after a session. I am a regular here and I love it!",positive
I have always had my eyebrows waxed but Esha has got me hooked on eyebrow threading. I never knew my eyebrows could look this good. She reshaped my eyebrows and now I just go in to get them cleaned up every couple of weeks. I love that with threading even the little baby hairs around my brows and lips are gone and my makeup lays so much better. The price is very affordable and I've never had a hard time getting in to see Esha.,positive
Definitely the place to go for your threading needs. My wife went in for a session. The owner was not only very welcoming but very knowledgeable about what she was doing. She also gave her a 15% discount as a first time customer. Would definitely recommend this place if you are looking for an affordable yet professional threading place. Give this place a try.,positive
"Checked this place out since my girlfriend said my eyebrows looked like caterpillars, so I decided to try threading. I was very happy with the service and quality of work. It's located on the second floor of the complex and is quite, private and comfortable! If you have never tried threading, I suggest you do! The rose water at the end is a pleasant relief, which apparently she sells here as well.",positive
Love the girls they do a awesome job . they take their time to make sure you leave with awesome eyebrows .will be back .,positive
I been to this place many times and love what theyve done to my brows. See you in two weeks again to get maintenance done.:),positive
"I love Maggi! She's creative, patient, and just really fun to work with--always up for trying out something new and helping her client find that perfect personal style. The whole team at Details is great, they make it a pleasure to visit the salon and I always look forward to my appointments.",positive
"It's always so scary going to a new salon for a new stylist to do my hair for the first time. Am I right?! However, I found my new salon. Praise God! Kelly L did such a great job and was so cute & helpful. She knew exactly what I wanted and executed it beautifully. Highlights, lowlights and a cut. It turned out exactly the way I imagined and maybe even a little better. Happy to have a new go to gal! Aveda over everything.",positive
"I love the comfortable vibe of this salon! It's clean, fresh and charming and I always feel welcome there. I have been going to Maggi for years and she's truly amazing. She is always in tune with the trends and knows how to transform my hair through both cut and color. She exceeds my expectations every time!",positive
"I love this place. Cool vibe, comfortable. I see Wilson for haircuts. I love how she cuts layers and she is so fun to be around. I previously went to her at another salon and followed her to Details. Yeah, she's that good. Aveda products...check. They have a great price of $35 for gel manicures which is solid.",positive
"If you're a guy, don't go here unless you want a short cookie cutter cut. Best cuts could have done the exact cut for 9 bucks. No attention to detail. When I said it was looking a bit off, the stylist told me "" I am not done yet"" should of left than. Receptionist offered a re- cut, however my hair was cut so short it couldn't be cut anymore. If you want trendy or fun don't go! Crazy mullets is way better",negative
"Fantastic haircuts! My wife and I both go here. We are both 30 yrs old and are both pretty picky about our haircuts. We both took a chance here after having bad haircuts from several places on the west side of Cleveland. We have been very happy every time we have walked out of here with the quality we have gotten. Not to mention the service here is A+. All of this is mixed with a good value. If you even somewhat care about your haircuts, this is the place for you.",positive
I'm so done with this salon. I guess my great run is done. I loved coming in. The atmosphere was always wonderful but my last two experiences have completely turned me off and I won't be returning. I got burnt on the side of my face and even the next time I tried a new stylist I booked the appointment at the beginning of the week only to get a text at 7:30 am the day of when my appointments at 9 from the stylist saying that she wasn't in town after all my confirmation emails and text. I am beyond disappointed because making arrangements before work and being up and ready was a waste of my precious time. Officially my last attempt to give anyone at this place a chance.,negative
"Beautiful and relaxing decor. My stylist Sha'kai was very professional and friendly, felt like I knew her before. A must return",positive
"If I could give -1 star I would. My first and last time at this salon. I made an appointment to have a touch up done to my roots. Kenya answered the phone when I called and she was very professional answering my questions. That was the only thing professional about my experience with this salon. When I arrived there was no one at the reception to greet meet and I had to wait a little bit until someone turned around to come to the front desk. Keisha came and told me the appointment was with her. She gave me two forms to complete, one of which basically asked you to sign away your life and any liability for any damage the hairdressers may do to your hair. Major red flag! No salon that's worth their reputation would have you sign a disclaimer form absolving their hairdressers from any liability. Clearly they have had issues in the past to have this as a policy. I asked to see the color product she would be using. For some reason after I asked to see the product she would be using she seemed like she did not like me asking this (as she went to get the product showed it to me and then turned around and walked away without a word, which was rude). I had questions regarding the price I was quoted and asked the owner (who seemed nice), but her explanations for a la carte pricing seemed not only outrageous but down right ridiculous, $95 for only a touch up to my roots! ($60 color service, $25 shampoo/conditioner, $10 for color product). She indicated because I was getting only the color (roots touch up mind you) with no styling this would be the cost. Not even in NYC would an upscale salon charge this much. I was on time for my appointment, however I waited for 30 minutes got up and walked out (and she still was blow drying another client's hair). The funny thing is they have a late policy for their customers with a grace period of 15 minutes after which they will start charging by the minute for your tardiness and add that amount to your bill or next service. Certain types of salons have no respect for your time and a simple service that should take an hour or so may end up taking half your day and costing you an arm and a leg. I felt the ""you are going to sit here all afternoon vibe"" and will never allow for that foolishness. I was very lucky to leave when I did as Keisha's lack of professionalism was a telltale sign of what could've turned out to be an awful experience. Thank you Father God!",negative
"I give this salon a -5. Let me first start by saying the owner Lamonica Cuthberson is the most ill mannered individual to deal with. I went to have my hair done on a Saturday morning at 10:30 am to have my hair colored rose gold ( my current color was plum brown) not only was I in this god forsaken salon for 8 hrs I walked out with my hair the same color just slightly and I mean SLIGHLY lighter. When I called the person who did my hair she mentioned she spoke to the owner and told her I did not look satisfied when I left . I asked for a refund for the color I was told to call the next day in the am to speak to the owner. When I called I spoke to some more rude ignorant staff members and was told she was not there. Long story short I was denied my simple refund for the color. They charged me $190 dollars for nothing. I would not recommend this salon to a pet rabbit. They are overpriced, slow and do not really know what they are doing in there. Customer service is -1000000. WORSE SALON EXPERIENCE I HAVE EVER HAD!!!!",negative
"Meh. I was referred by a close friend who knew the stylist really well. At the time, I had natural hair (it wasn't chemically treated) and I asked for a particular style. By the time she was done, the other stylists were looking and trying to say something nice to me. When I finally took a look at my hair, I just SMH and ask the stylist to REDO MY HAIR, rinse it out and let's start over. My hair was crunchy, and I had to stay in the salon an extra HOUR so she could fix the mess. Terrible experience...",negative
"I recently relocated to Charlotte and was in need of a natural hair stylist... After reading the 40+ positive reviews on Google, I ventured to this salon in Jan. 2016 where I was serviced by Ashley (a new-comer as well). I have been a regular customer ever since for regular hair maintenance - twists, protein treatments, trims, straightening, highlights - and LOVE the flexibility that the salon offers in booking appointments online and their wi-fi access. I've truly enjoyed the service that I've received from Ashley and always receive compliments on my hair from strangers in public. I sometimes have an idea of what I want, and then Ashley is able to expand it to something more. Most importantly, my hair is without damage and continues to flourish under Ashley's care, despite my lazy maintenance regime in between.",positive
"I love this place! If you are looking for friendly staff, great environment and a clean salon this is the place for you. I have been going for a year now and it's great!",positive
"Here I am in charlotte college student looking for a natural hair salon. I finally settle on this place because my hair needed attention. I come in on Saturday, nice atmosphere and lighting . I ask about the natural hair services and decided to get an updo. I make the appointment for 2pm the next day. My advice don't come any earlier because I came at 1:30, saw the open sign lit up but the doors were locked until exactly 2pm. I come in meet the stylist. She ""consulted"" my hair. Not really telling me any useful information. I told her the style I wanted and she seemed to try and coax me into a blow out . Which I was trying to steer away from due to heat damage, she then detangled my hair while it was Dry . Washed it and blow dried it . . Not sure if that's right but anyway the final result was satisfactory. Maybe next time I will try a specific natural salon",negative
"LaMonica can straighten hair well. However, she is not the best at blowing and neither are her employees. After having my hair blow dried my ends were broken off. My ends were not previously split bc I'd recently had them trimmed. I tried to talk to the owner about the issue but she defended the stylist poor techniques. I've known others to go this salon and not be pleased by the outcome. I will not return.",negative
"Dislike, Closing the doors with no notice! Bad Form. Will follow my stylist, not this bankrupt company.. My 16 year old daughter was there when they notified the Arrowhead staff. The Staff was in tears, unbelief, etc. As can be understood-notified 5 days before the doors closed. This company is unprofessional and desperate. Won't be back EVER- to any location.. Get a new accountant- some class.. And Good luck..",negative
"I had been getting my hair done here every 6 weeks for the last few years. They refused my appointment today because I had my three week old with me. Since hiring a baby sitter for my exclusively breast fed newborn isn't an option, I'll have to seek another salon to give my business to.",negative
I love this location! From the moment you walk you feel spoiled. Every little detail in decor is feminine and luxurious! The staff is warm and friendly and if you should have an issue with anything they are quick to fix it. I can be difficult a difficult client when it comes to my hair and to waxing and they always listen to my concerns and do the best to accommodate me. The relaxation area upstairs is amazing and I melt up there. The chocolate pedicures are too die for! I'm a dolce addict and will be back every chance I get! The experience is well worth the price.,positive
"I was given a 90 min customized organic facial by my MIL for mothers day. Shelley my facialist did amazing & was very sweet. She did not try to sell me product (like a lot of places do) actually said my skin looked great & was happy I wear sunscreen everyday. I would give her 6 stars if I could. The cashier/receptionist upon leaving is the reason I gave 4. No personality & never asked if I enjoyed my facial, or anything. Just ""do you want to leave tip"" uhh okay. Of course I did leave Shelley 30%, which I hope she doesn't have to share. Even tho it was a gift, that brought me in. if I can book with Shelley again, I will be back.",positive
"I went to dolce a couple years back and saw Gab. At this time she was in training. When I came in I told the receptionist(who was very polite) that I had an appointment with Gab, she went and got her right away. I waited less then five minutes for Gab to come and take me back. The place wasn't busy people getting their haircuts but it was also at 4pm. She took me back to her booth and asked my what I wanted done. I told her that I wanted some layers in my hair and my extensions(which I had brought my own) to blend in with my hair. (I had previously had my friends mom cut my hair which was a mistake) She washed my hair then took my back to her station. As she did my hair she talked to me and made me feel as if I was just one of her friends. She told me what she was doing as she did it and asked if it was okay to cut length off my extensions as well. She told me how she put the extension in my hair as well, which were clip in. When she finished cutting my hair she showed me how she styled her hair and it was simple and cute. I had mentioned how all the products she used smelled so good and she showed me what they were and what they were used for. She spent about 2 hours with me(granted this was on her day off she came in to do my hair). I was definitely satisfied with the cut and the experience with Gab! She gave me a paper that had recommended products on it so I definitely didn't feel like she was trying to make me buy all these hair products. While I was there I decided to get some waxing done which was my eyebrows, chin, and upper lip. For the price I was not impressed. The receptionist took me back and the waiting room was beautiful. I waited probably a good twenty minutes to a half hour for the lady to bring me back. The waxing took about 15 minutes and she didn't trying making small talk which was nice. For how expensive it was I didn't think it lasted long enough. All in all I would definitely go back and see Gab, it was quite expensive so I haven't been able to go back since. I have gone to my mothers hairstylist which does not do nearly as good as a job like Gab does. She is definitely worth the price to go see! I really want to try out getting my nails done here. However, I would never recommends getting waving done here.",positive
"While I can't say I have ever had a horrible experience here, I do think that the atmosphere is pretty pretentious and the services are extremely overpriced. The massage I got there was good, but the manicure, pedicure, and hair treatment I got were just mediocre at best. I realize they charge more for the sake of the one stop shop convenience, but I personally think it is worth it to go to different locations for nail, massage, and hair services.",negative
"I love Dolce and have been a client at the Borgata for years. I always plan ahead and stock up on Hunies when they are buy $100.00 get $200.00 in Hunies. Hadley gives the most amazing facials. I really appreciate the complimentary blowouts offered after massages and facials. I can not wait for the Scottsdale Quarter location to open! Hoping some of my ""girls"" will work there one or two days a week.",positive
"Pretty, Pretty Princesses apply here. The salon is very fancy and pretty. It is almost disgustingly so with hanging chandeliers, Water Fall walls, and a pretty rustic, curving rail stairs. The boutique is pretty. ( I got a killer necklace pretty cheap) The relaxing room and hallways, locker room are all pretty darn nice looking. I would never in a million years think to go here but I received a coupon for a massage for participating in Pat's Run. I was long overdue for a massage and did not want to wait to go to the massage school I usually frequent. I indulged, even with the coupon the price was a bit higher than I can afford on a teacher's salary. The location is not very convenient for me either. What the heck, I work hard. A gal can splurge every now and again. I had no problems booking the same day appointment. It is strange that you actually do not get the location you want when you call. You get the Chandler location but that is how they do it I suppose. The gal who answered the phone might have been new or in training. She did not know directions nor prices 100 percent as well as she should. However, someone was behind her coaching her. I am totally okay with that since she was super nice and answered all my questions. She asked if she could put me on hold, did not keep me on hold for very long, and asked if it was okay if she could inquire from the other person for help. I liked that. Getting there was another story. It is a little tricky to find but I finally pulled in at 10 minutes to appointment time. I was greeted immediately and brought up stairs. I was offered a drink and showed the relaxation room. My only gripe was the lady in there talking on the cell phone. It is called the Relaxation Room for a reason. Come on folks, shut it off please. ( this is not the salons fault though and the room is very pretty) I was picked up on time almost immediately after filling out my paperwork. Samantha was my massage therapist. I did not pay for the deep tissue massage. They did discuss that the Swedish Massage was a light to medium pressure. Samantha did a great job. She seemed to find all the knots. I am super ticklish at times too but all went well. After the massage I was greeted right away by the upstairs cashier and went shopping in the boutique downstairs. Everyone was very friendly and helpful towards me. Another drink for the road too. All in all, this was a very lovely experience. I probably would not go back, but through no fault of the Dolce. The non discounted prices and highly inconvenient locations are prohibitive. Perhaps when they offer a Groupon again I might reconsider or if they opened one up in the Downtown Phoenix/ Biltmore area.",positive
I went here once a week prior to a hair and makeup appointment I had booked for Saturday just to check the place out. I got my eyebrows waxed and all in all everything went well and my experience was overall very good. A few days later I got a call from Dolce telling me that my hair and makeup appointment that I made for 2:30 would now have to be moved to 3:00. Why you ask? Because the makeup artist they booked me with was not going to be there and now all the other makeup artists were booked up for 2:30. I called way ahead of time to book my appointment so something like this wouldn't happen. I called twice and got put on hold for 10-15 minutes once. It is extremely frustrating that I have to be in a rush now instead of being able to relax like one should be able to when paying for salon services. When talking to the girls who work at Dolce on the phone they told me that 3:00 was the best they could do and there's nothing else they can do. At this point I'd really like to cancel my appointment here and go to a different salon but it is too late to book something somewhere else.,negative
"Went to the Scottsdale location with a Groupon that was for a 60 min massage. I made sure I came 20 min early in case I needed time to change for the therapist. I ended up waiting in the lobby right until my appt time, which was fine because I assumed the 60 min would start once my therapist staryed massaging. About 15 min had past by the time she got started and she stopped right at the hour which meant I only got a 45 min massage (which was only average quality). I complained at the front desk but never heard from the manager or anyone so I wrote Groupon and got a refund. Never went back.",negative
I purchased a gift card for my wife and mother-in-law to have a nice mother and daughter day. They tried to schedule a spa day twice each time they were cancelled at the last moment. The last time they cancelled 45 minutes before the appointment!! I could not find another spay day on such sort notice. What a waste of money!,negative
"My (now) wife and I were looking for a wedding venue that fit us, but could accommodate us and our guests in the heat of June. Just as we were about to book a downtown warehouse (which would have been over our budget), we accidentally came across Affairs by Doco (run by and out of Dolce Salon & Spa at Arrowhead). With hot pink and neon green accent walls, and a chandelier suite, it was the perfect amount of funk and brought just a touch of class. The chandelier suite seated our 70 guests inside comfortably for dinner. There is a great outdoor space and would be wonderful to host an event in the winter, but worked splendidly for our evening wedding on a 111 degree day. Whitney, our event coordinator, was there through the whole process and transitioned the dining room to a dance floor while we were in the adjacent room cutting the cannoli (instead of cake). I would advise, there is limited space for bridal party/family pictures unless you like parking lot pictures, so my wife and I did a ""first look"" and took pictures with the bridal party ahead of time off-site. While the prices have gone up slightly since we booked, it's still cheaper than any of the other venues we looked at, we were able to bring in our own caterer, and didn't have to go through the hassle of renting tables, chairs, and linens on our own. A surprising service to be provided by a spa, but one they knocked out of the park.",positive
"I went with a level 2 stylist, big mistake. My cut was alot shorter than what I asked for, which isn't to big of a deal but the problem was that the cut is VERY uneven. I also had color which she struggled with. Luckly I ended up leaving with a normal color after she said it had turned purple. Highly suggest you go with a higher level stylist!!",negative
"Katie is great! They were helpful at the desk and gave my daughter a great cut. I love their specials and follow them on facebook, but I probably wouldn't pay full price because i'm cheap.",positive
"I have been a client for 4 years. I had a friend donating her hair to my sister who has cancer. I wanted to plan a spa day of her and I and wanted to know if there were any specials due to that circumstance. I also wanted to find out if they had any suggestions on where to make the wig. I was still accepting the circumstances of my sisters situation and sometimes cry if I talk out loud about it so I chose email to make it easier on myself. No response. I comment on their wall on how long it takes to respond to emails. Still no response. I had contacted other places and they got back to me but I really wanted to hear back from them because I wanted to boom with my favorite person there. Well, I have up and decided to go with another company. Whatever. But what makes me more mad than anything is that they still keep updating their Facebook and ignore me. But what's worse is they let some random commenter talk to me the way they did and still not respond. I was never rude. I never did anything wrong. And this is how I'm treated? I guess customer service is something they don't care about and now one of their best employees lost 2 clients forever.",negative
"WOW! I just had the best haircut of my life! I met Brody tonight for a cut and style at the Arrowhead loction and my experience with her was amazing. Before we got started, we chatted a bit about what I was looking for in a cut. She listened to what I wanted and delivered. She easily found things we had in common to chat about during the cut. I left feeling HOT with volume up to the sky! I cant wait to get my hands on my hair and see what I can do with it! Brody is a KEEPER! :)",positive
"Not satisfied with the way my hair turned out. Not what I envisioned :( Top looks lighter than the bottom. Magda, the stylist, was in a rush to get out of there. Will not be going back to her. Also, place is way over priced.",negative
"I'd like to qualify that this is really more of a 3.5 star place in my opinion, but of course Yelp doesn't offer that as an option. Also, full disclosure, I'm a total spa addict. I love going in to different places and getting facials and massages. In the past year, I've been to the Camelback Inn Spa, Joya Spa, and Elizabeth Arden Red Door Spa, in addition to Dolce. During Arizona's spa weeks when tons of spas offer services for $50, I've been known to go multiple times a week to different spas to get services. I've been going to Dolce since last year, when I got a gift card from my cousin. I've been back for several massages and facials since then and had a really great experience each time. Were the massages on par with the ones I've gotten at Joya or the Red Door Spa? No, of course not. The price differential is quite large, especially when you take into consideration that I never go to Dolce without using some kind of Facebook Hook Up, Groupon or Hunies to get at least half off the service. For the price that I'm paying, these services are awesome! You get the luxury atmosphere of the spa and a relaxing day without having to empty out everything in your wallet. While the services aren't on par with the ones I've received at places that have $200 massages, they also aren't charging $200 - hence my satisfaction. I love the 90-minute Swedish and Combination massages and my favorite masseuse is Sherrie, who's always giving me tips on how to reduce the stress on my back and arms from my desk job. I've never had a problem with the desk staff, as some other reviewers have noted below. It seems that a lot of the unhappy reviews are associated with salon services, which I've never tried, so they could be 100% valid. In terms of massages and facials, I think Dolce is a great place - just make sure to be on the look out for their Facebook deals to get a good price!",negative
"I got great good highlights from Zach at Arrowhead, when I was desperate for some decent color one sunny day.... I would 100% say you can trust him with your color, he does a very precise job with the foils and the natural blend appearance when its done is great... even as he uses several colors is just amazing how pretty it looks. He blends his toners and blends his colors so he really picks accurate and pretty shades. I also had dyed my hair myself so it was a bit orange and uneven colored in places and he actually fixed it. The next time I go and I will let him know I want to get a little more eclectic and Im sure it will look great. Ive had my hair colored and highlighted all over the world at various salons so I can tell he knows what he is doing and he is polite also. I also go to the Borgata location alot....I just had highlights from a Level 2 Alyssa..she was awesome and I would recommend because you save with a Level 2 and you will get GREAT quality color from her and I got a beautiful style blow out from her assistant Roxy who had adorable bright red hair. They will be my new GO TO girls!!! I again went to Borgata and had the most beautiful color done with Annette, Level 2 and she trimmed my bangs so perfect, long and I can swoop them prettily to the side..I have past shoulder length hair, long layers and Annette gave me the best blowout after the color. My hair looks FABULOUS. I highly recommend Annette, her work is beautiful! Both color and cut. Ya Ya... Another great level 2 is Katia/Katiya..not sure how to spell.",positive
"Went here Saturday with my mother-in-law for a mani/pedi and had a fabulous time! This place is huge...3 stories...wasn't expecting that. The nail technicians were super friendly and did a great job. The only ding is for the prices...We were able to use a Groupon to get 50% off standard pricing, but the regular total for two mani/pedis was $180.00. Yikes!",positive
"At the risk of sounding like everyone else, the only reason they got one star is because I had to give them one! First, I had my hair cut and colored here one time and the girl seemed mad my appointment was at 8 and then gave me the most bland hair I've ever had. I asked for the fringe bangs and she definitely gave me the same side swipe everyone else there had and my color was totally flat. Okay, so I decided to give them a second chance and scheduled a pedicure, manicure, cut and color for both my mom and myself. Huge mistake. I broke my collarbone three days before the appointment and told them that when I arrived. This way, they would not turn on the chair and be sensitive to how they moved me when doing services. My $85 pedicure did not include paraffin wax, nor clipping/shaping of my nails or any sort of pumice. The girl spent her time talking loudly to another girl at a nearby station and managed to smudge both my mom and I's nails. Oh, and turned the chair on to ""massage"" my hugely swollen, bruised, broken colloarbone. Whatever, just get me to the hair station. I told the girl, I want to go lighter with blonde highlights. My mom said lowlights and mostly, just cover the gray! I came out with jet black hair and my mother ended up with gray temples. My cut came out with side swept bangs and razored ends, which are TERRIBLE for thin, fine hair. My mom had some sort of long, bowl cut...horrible. They were both rude and basically wanted us out of their chairs. At the cash register, they brought us baskets full of product they had supposedly used. Um, no, they didn't use anything but shampoo and conditioner! We paid, my mom left a huge tip and we grimaced our way out. I went to another salon to fix my hair and my AWESOME stylist there called the salon to see what they had used so she could fix it. I could actually hear the manager screaming into the phone, saying they had no records of what had been done. That the stylist had ""forgot"" to write it down. Then proceded to call me a liar and demand that I go back to have it fixed by the same stylist. Uh, no thanks, chief. DO NOT USE THIS SALON EVER. I would suggest box color before these hair Hitlers.",negative
"Really shocked at the low reviews on here! I love Dolce and find that they offer many deals to stay competitive while giving the most excellent customer service ever! I had a Combo Massage at Arrowhead today with Paige! I am so hooked on her! She keeps the lights very low and doesn't talk during the massage unless you have a concern or question. I love that! Also, she listened to my problem areas and really designed the massage to help with my issues. This combo massage does a little deep tissue and some Swedish combined with Reflexology...and let me just say that the Reflexology part ROCKED even more than the rest of the awesome! She really used her strength to get a lot of tension out of my poor hoofers! I will most def be back with Paige @ Arrowhead! In fact, I will arrange my appointments around her availability! I'm hooked! As always the rest of the staff was very professional and helpful. I think you'd be silly to go elsewhere.........but if you do that makes it easier for me to get in!",positive
I am also a little surprised to see the poor reviews. I have been going to my stylist at this salon for about three years (may be more) - she is fantastic and my hair always looks great. I have also had pedicures there and one was really good - one of the technicians is not one of my favorite - but nothing over the top awful. I do agree it can be a bit pricey - but when they offer deals they are really great. I have had facials at other dolces and they are good (not great but good - again this depends on the technician). I may be biased and giving the four stars because my stylist is that great. But I don't think that the services is awful - I am always greeted - never pressured to book new services - and always happy when I leave.,positive
"I was gifted a coupon for $90 to Dolce and this location was closest to my house. When I called to make an appointment I had to listen to a machine, hit a number, listen some more, talk to a ""representative"" and then she connected me to the front desk. Ummm ok? A woman gave me some information on the facials I was interested in, and then suggested a peel and that I should come in to have a test patch done. I won't go into detail because it's been said, but the customer service is just AWFUL. I have never felt so unwelcome. I wonder if the only time these girls are nice is if their friends come in for a service. There were around five of them just standing around talking. I don't know where the unemployment rates are coming from because this Dolce has hired at least %10 of Arizona. After I was taken upstairs through a literal maze I was not asked any questions about my skin, I had to tell her what I was not happy with and what results I was looking for. She barely said anything except how crappy drugstore face washes are because they don't balance your PH and how I should buy face wash from Dolce, (no thanks I get all my stuff from Lush and it's fantastic, natural, and cheap.) Then she told me to lay down and proceeded to slop some goop on my neck, without even cleaning the area first. I don't wear make up on my neck but it does get hot outside so there must have been dust/sweat. She told me to make my appointment before I left, but if I had a reaction to the chemical I could call and change the service. Uhh no, how about I go home and decide when I feel like making another appointment? I was asked to walk by the front desk again for reasons unknown, they tried to book an appointment for me, I lied and said I would have to check my schedule and call them back. Over the next few days that patch of skin on my neck started peeling little white pieces of skin and would not stop for over a week. I know that is expected with peels but honestly I'm only 21 and I don't need that much of a miracle right now especially if I have to hide in my house for that long after. I ended up giving the gift certificate to my cousin who just had a baby. I figure she can try the Dolce down where she lives and get a nice massage. Not long after I found another coupon for a different spa and had the most relaxing facial and pleasant experience. Funny their location was a fraction of the size and had a handful of staff. I guess bigger isn't always better.",negative
"Unfortunately I have to agree with Penny Lane and Colleen M as my experience somewhat paralleled theirs. Upon walking into the salon, the front desk ladies didn't even acknowledge my friend and I. They saw us walk in but then turned their backs to resume chatting with each other. When we approached the front desk, I had to do a polite ""ah hem"" to get someones attention. The two girls were less than thrilled to have their conversation interrupted. This became obvious when they proceeded to check us in without ANY conversation whatsoever. We did get a ""is this your first time here"" in the elevator on the way upstairs to the salon. My friend and I were both pleased that the rudeness we experienced downstairs didn't carry out with the other staff members. We each had a massage/facial/hair style and makeup application and the ladies tending to us were really sweet. Aside from the constant attempts to sell their products, it was a nice experience. Overall it was a nice atmosphere if you are into vintage chic, damask and TONS of colorful chandeliers. We both enjoyed a wonderful massage and facial. Pass on a style or makeup application though; neither of us were pleased with our results. Once you get past the front desk, the experience isn't bad at all; but I've definitely experienced a more relaxing/delightful spa day elsewhere.",negative
"I first learned about Dolce as a volunteer for Girls Night Out. Since then, I have visited the salon and spa to ""treat"" myself to haircuts, manicures, massages, and facials. Dolce is a true escape and you pay for what you get in terms of service and atmosphere. Keep in mind that there are many deals to be had at Dolce. The best secret is to get on their email list and mailing list. You will be mailed steals and deals that make such pampering affordable (ex: a $45 hair cut and style for $25). Dolce cares about the community as well as their clients. I will continue to give my business to them and encourage others to do the same.",positive
"I got an AMAZING facial here, very pleased, and no upselling at the end. Everyone was pleasant, professional, and I got great value for the money. I am recommending it to all my f2f friends, and to you!",positive
"I walked into Dolce before seeing a movie next door at Harkins. Don't waste your time or money here, esp when there are so many other choices in the Valley. This place is way overpriced and the service is awful! You'd expect with all the money they spent to have this upscale-looking place, they would hire people who could at least greet you and not act so snotty. Calling Dolce is a pain in the butt too, you feel like you are calling a Call Center routing you to a specific department. Why can't the women at the counter just pick up and answer the frickin' phone?",negative
"I went there to pick up some Bumble and Bumble product since the Bb website said they carried that line. I walked in and I was the only one there (Monday afternoon). There were three girls at the counter and not a single one of them even acknowledged that I was there. I spent several minutes locating the product because the packaging had changed, still no one asked to assist me or if I was there for an appointment. When I found my product I walked over to the counter and the three women proceeded to ignore me for another minute or so. When they finally decided to assist me, they were very short, and put out by me wanting to purchase something. Then they handed me my product with no bag and turned their back to me. I had a question I needed to ask them and they were not happy that I was bothering them. I had always wanted to go there for a spa day but I think I will pass from now on. Their priced on Bb are more expensive than anywhere else. I think I will stick with driving to Scottsdale for my salon needs.",negative
"Not sure how they survive. The salon is pretty but that is about it. Calling to make an appointment is a nightmare. Half of the time you can't get anyone to pick-up. Most of the time if I get someone on the phone I have to wait over 5 minutes and listen to the most irritating recording over and over. My technician is awesome and lI live five minutes away, so that is why I keep going back. It is clean. The girls at the reception desk should not be in customer service. It is just overall poorly managed. The prices are the highest in the west valley. Do not drive out of your way for the salon.",negative
"this was my first experience at Dragonfly Gypsy and i am in love! my eyelash extensions were perfectly placed, a lot of care and precision was taken. wonderful atmosphere as well (i enjoyed the one on one instead of a busy salon with lots going on). I was explained every step of the process which makes it a lot more comfortable and was given fantastic aftercare instructions. if i could give more stars i would",positive
I always wondered how ladies looked so great..well... Cheryl has introduced me to some beauty secrets and I could not be happier! I appreciate that she is always getting certified for new enhancement beauty treatments and products.. Her style seat appointments are very easy to book and the text appointment reminders are awesome! Thank you Cheryl!!!,positive
"Always LOVE LIVE LOVE my hair and always get LOTS LOTS LOTS of complements! Im adding a pic of one of the many cuts/colors my wonderful Cheryl does for me. I'm adding several of my daughter's ""Cheryl"" creations as well!",positive
"I booked via style seat after reading outstanding reviews on Cheryl for A new set of lashes. I am thrilled with the results - absolutely stellar work! From the moment I walked in, she immediately greeted me, and it definitely had a great energy in her entire studio- she is top notch - and I am very excited to book her for additional services vs flying home to get them done! I have quite high standards and Cheryl has exceeded them. So very easy to talk to and she made it the best part of being here in Phoenix for business worthwhile!",positive
"Cheryl is not only AH-MAZING at eyelashes but color, cut, tan and the products she uses are top shelf! If you are looking for a one stop shop for services she's your lady!",positive
Cheryl is the best! She got my lashes done for the second time and I would not even go to anyone else. If you give her a call she will come in and take you at YOUR earliest conscience. She does a thorough job and cares about her clients. Definitely recommending this to everybody.,positive
I walked in to Cheryl in the morning hoping she could rescue my hair color. She was gracious enough to fit me in the afternoon. I walked out 100% satisfied. She did an amazing job and she woudn't let me see my hair until she was done taking picures :-) I am so happy I found her and I'll be coming back again and again. I can't wait to see what she does when I go in for cut and color :-),positive
"Have always gotten great coloring and cuts from Cheryl and that's really saying something. I've gone from long flowing locks to ridiculously cute short bobs. I've also been brunette, blonde, siren red, hot pink, and blonde with purple tips, ALL done by Cheryl and ALL FANTASTIC!",positive
Cheryl is amazingly talented! I didn't know what to expect with my very 1st eyelash experience but ....OMG! They are amazing and she did such a wonderful job. I get complimented all the time on my eyelashes and many people have no clue they are extensions! I won't be going anywhere else and I can't wait to see her talents when I have her color/cut my hair.,positive
"Best stylist in Las Vegas, even when I moved to Los Angeles, I trust no one else to my cut and color and make trips to visit family and always book an appointment with Ecktor when I'm in town. He incorporates Aruvedic techniques into his hair care that makes my scalp feel so revived, it takes 10 years off me in one visit. I always get tons of compliments on my hair cut and color. He's a master colorist, master stylist, very professional and understanding. I highly recommend his services.",positive
"I found Ecktor at my Las Vegas layover pre-vaca and went to him to get vacation-ready hair! I was in for an amazing surprise. I LOVED the service from beginning to end. From the tea, hair wash, hot towel facial to the actual haircut with precision and detail to give me the volume I desired while maintaining my hair length - he's a hair genius! And super sweet person. I wish he was local to me because I'd be a regular! Thanks a ton Ecktor! Loving the life my hair has again :)",positive
I met Ecktor through my family and my favorite part of each visit is him always going above and beyond. He really understands how your hair falls and should be cut (not without your direction mind you) and gives a great temple massages at the end of the hair wash. I feel very confident after each haircut with Ecktor as my hair stylist,positive
"I have been a true customer to Ecktor for years. I love his honesty and passion for life. He is upbeat, energetic and does brilliant stylist work. His creativity and ability to see outside the box with design, color and style is what sets him above other stylists. I highly recommend that anyone come see him! He isn't a beautician ...he is a magician!",positive
"I was fortunate enough to meet Ecktor one evening at work and that's when he left me his business card. From there it was a done deal. Not only does he have an amazing personality...he has a talent for hair. I love the way he cuts, colors and styles my hair and keeps me thoroughly entertained while working his magic. He also does my daughters hair. We love Ecktor and will not go anywhere else.",positive
"What is there to say about Ecktor other then that he's the best damn cutter of hair I have ever met in my 29 years. He's passionate about his craft, will recommend product to use if you inquire, and will help to bring the beauty that you are into the light! Not only is he super talented, but once you get to know him he will act as your therapist. This has saved me tons of money!! I could go on and on about Ecktor, but I will just end this review with one last bit of advice. Call and schedule an appointment with Ecktor as soon as you can, it will change your life!!",positive
Eector has been cutting my hair for years now. I've gone through many hair styles. He has been very good at giving me the haircut I ask for and giving his advice as to what's the new hairstyle that's in. Eector is always very professional and by the end of the hour I always leave feeling relaxed and confident. I'd classify him not only as a hair stylist but as a therapist too.,positive
"Ecktor is by far my favorite stylist! I've been moving state to state the past 10 years and ended up in Vegas about two years ago. I've been all over from New York to Miami to Beverly Hills... you name it and I've been there, so I feel I can offer a good comparison. I am very picky with who I see but my friend encouraged me to give Ecktor a try as he had done wonders on her hair. I wasn't disappointed! He is very professional and you can tell he loves what he does. Getting a good hair cut is one thing, getting a perfect hair cut by someone who is passionate in their work and amazing at their job is a completely different thing and he delivers on this. I highly recommend him and without a doubt he is the best stylist I've been to.",positive
I really liked how everyone was super friendly and easy to talk to but when I pay for a blowout and style I want what I pay for. I could've easily blow dried my hair at home for free and have it turn out exactly if not better than how it looked after getting my hair done today. No volume - flat and boring hair. I would most definitely not return for a blow dry and style.,negative
"I have been going to Ecco now for almost 5 years and it is the only salon I trust. The stylist are so friendly and helpful. They are a teaching salon and it shows in how up to date they are with all the new techniques. I go to ether Sarah Beth or Laura. Either I would highly recommend for coloring and cuts. I have gone brown, red, and platinum blonde over the years and they have done a fabulous job every time.",positive
"I brought in my two daughters (4 and 5) last night for haircuts. Grace did an excellent job of making them feel comfortable given it was their first time at Ecco. She listened to their request but was great about checking with me to ensure that was really what I wanted done with their hair. She even curled their hair at the end, of course asked me first if it was ok, and the girls left saying they felt like princesses! Thank you, Grace!",positive
"From the moment I entered, I was treated with an upmost respect and positivity. I was offered a beverage while I filled out a 'first time customer' information form. Promptly after I finished that information, I was taken back to get my hair cut. I was lucky enough to get a wonderful conversationalist and talented stylist, Jessica. I came in with a vision for my hair cut and she delivered exactly what I wanted within a reasonable amount of time. I would recommend ECCO Salon to anyone who is insecure about getting their hair cut to go to Jessica and she will work with you to get the look you desire. Overall, I'm very delighted with my experience and will be back for more my next time back in Wisconsin.",positive
"I have naturally curly hair and struggled my way through various salons and a few terrible cuts before finding Ecco last winter. I was horribly nervous that I'd receive another bad cut from someone who didn't really know how to properly cut curly hair, but my concerns were unfounded--Sara Beth has been nothing but wonderful. I trust her implicitly with cuts and coloring--she's consistently excellent, and I'm so grateful to have found someone so talented in Madison. I can't recommend her (or the salon) enough.",positive
"Came in after hearing about this place in Epic's list of discounted places. 15% off first service. Friendly and professional staff! I was greeted immediately and the front desk employee took my coat for me and got me water (offered other drinks too) to drink while I waited, which is so simple but very welcoming and kind! My stylist, Stephanie, was a good listener and did a great job explaining the Aveda products, styling, and hair maintenance. They also respected my need of sulfate-free shampoo during the service as SLS makes me scalp break out, and I appreciated them accommodating that need. I'm happy with my haircut! Great experience overall and will return.",positive
"Cut was good but utterly ruined my haircolor! I went in for my roots to be touched up and for purple to be dyed on top of my existing blonde hair. Not a terribly difficult task as I dye my own hair at home and get pretty good results having blonde hair. My stylist EL said it might come out a bit darker but would still be ""vibrant"" purple. I'm not terribly picky so I said that would be fine as long as it was purple... we'll low and behold it turns out stark black! I went in a second time for them to fix it by just lightening it up to a ""light purple"". The entire time I received attitude from the stylist and walked out with maroon hair. I overpaid for hair I need to wait and grow out to get rid of- what a rip off. Very dissapointed and highly recommend people find other salons if they want non natural color.",negative
"I had Ashley cut and color my hair this evening. I thought the color looked ok when I was there but got home and found it way too dark and way too red. Ick. I never asked for dark red. Also, the cut was barely anything. I'm not sure why I even paid for it. It doesn't look any different than it did when I walked in the door. $100 down the toilet. Now I get to try to lift the color out with dish soap. Yay! Fun way to spend an evening!",negative
"Great service and style from ""L"" (they have 2 Lindseys, so this stylist goes by ""L""). She's amazing with color - incredible job with blending and highlights. Lovely scalp massage + aromatherapy every time. It was nice to get a discount on the second visit when it was scheduled after the 1st visit!",positive
I'm from Madison but live in Chicago and make trips back solely to go to this salon. My usual go-to girl was booked the last weekend I happened to be in town (last week) and I went to Marie instead. I loved her. She was super sweet and definitely talented. I had a great experience and think she did a great job on my hair and brows!,positive
Always satisfied with Laura at Ecco. Always a pleasant expereince. Love love love the scalp massage. It would be nice to offer loyalty discounts to frequent customers.,positive
"This review will be purely about eyebrow waxing/shaping. I tend to grow out my eyebrow hair for a couple weeks when I find that I have butchered them in between maintenance. I don't know if this makes it necessarily more difficult or easier on an aesthetician (more to work with, I guess?), but this was the ""setting"" so to speak of what they started with whenever I came in for an appointment. On one of my visits, I came in with bushy brows, and came out with brows that were thin, had no arch or shape, and my left one had the tail-end separated from the rest of the brow. Jamie had done my eyebrows then, and to put it simply, I do not recommend her for this particular task. I don't know if it was because she was inexperienced or I just came in on a bad day. If it was due to inexperience, I wouldn't want to be the next person blindly scheduled with her for an eyebrow waxing. My visit after that, I came in with the same bushy brows but exited with fierce, perfect, diva-esque arches that I did not think were possible. JoJo did them that time (and everytime after that). I was so impressed that she shaped them very well without having a too-thin look. I HIGHLY recommend her if you need your brows to be livened up. (+) Contemporary ambience (+) Refreshments available (+) Friendly staff (+) JoJo for brows! (-) Noisy",positive
"I've been getting my hair cut at Ecco for over 3 years. The atmosphere is modern and cool. Everything is clean, and everyone is friendly. I would definitely recommend Ecco. I am pretty trustful of any stylist at an Aveda salon, so I'm not very particular about who I go to at Ecco. I've had my hair cut by many of their stylists. THE BEST So far, my favorite stylist has been Sarah T. She really took her time with the details, and I left feeling pretty, confident, and loving my new hairstyle. THE WORST The only stylist I haven't liked has been Marie. She was kind of rough. I also felt like she was rushing. I have a lot of hair, so it felt like she was overwhelmed and didn't have time to do a good job. When she took the cape off I was kind of shocked that she was done cutting my hair. She said if I needed it fixed, I could come back later in the week. If you can already tell that my hair looks bad and will need to be fixed, why are you letting me go out into the world with bad hair?!?!?!? I won't be going back to her ever again, but every other stylist I've had at Ecco has been great, so I will be back.",positive
"This was my first time at this salon. Based on my overall experience, I'm giving them a below average rating. The salon itself is clean and modern. However, because of the loft ceilings, sound seemed amplified. It was busy, very noisy, and the complete opposite of a relaxing experience. The receptionist was friendly and offered a beverage upon arrival, which was much appreciated. My stylist (Marie Nee) did not meet my expectations, and is the main reason for my below average rating. During shampooing and conditioning, she applied an extreme amount of pressure to my head/scalp. It was harsh and unpleasant. When she finished the haircut with my wet hair, she never asked if I liked the length. She was conservative on how much length she took off. (I suppose it's better to be conservative than to cut off too much hair.) However, it's the responsibility of the stylist to check with the client on how much length they want cut. My stylist did not do that. She then blow dried my hair and dry-cut long layers. I requested face-framing layers, but the stylist stated that my hair would look like a mullet. What?! It appeared as if she did not want to finish the haircut. (Not sure if she was running late and had another client waiting or what the deal was.) She seemed to rush me out of her chair and told me to go home, and if I needed to get the haircut fixed, I could return to the salon in the next few days. Wow, really? If she did a good job, there would not be a reason to offer that service! Upon returning home, I ended up fixing my own face-framing layers. It's always a bad sign when you have to fix your own haircut after a ""professional"" has cut it. Thumbs down. I may or may not go back to this salon. I will certainly request a different stylist.",negative
"I have been going to Ecco for years and I was so happy to see that they recently won ""Best of Madison"". No salon is more deserving. All the stylists and staff are so friendly and welcoming. They always offer a beverage shortly after arriving and the chocolate in the waiting area is a nice treat as well :) The complimentary hand massages are a nice way to relax while your color processes. I recently convinced my husband to go to Ecco and he raved about the service. He has already set up his next appointment. The scalp massages while getting your hair rinsed are so wonderful, I wish I could get one every week! I recommend this salon to everyone I can. They are the best!",positive
"I have never had such a great experience getting my eyebrows waxed. As far as I'm concerned, Mollie is the best in the Madison area. Also, if you book your second appointment at the time of your first service, you get a discount which is an awesome perk.",positive
"I love Ecco! All of the staff here are professional and do a great job! I second the review on Mollie's work-- she does wonderful brows! For hair, definitely schedule with Jenny, you will not be sorry! : )",positive
I had Mollie wax my eyebrows. By far THE best job anyone has ever done on my brows. I've been getting them waxed for many years. I tried Ecco out because it is 5 minutes from my work. This is where I plan to go from now on to get my eyebrows done. Everyone was friendly.,positive
"I enjoy this salon. I've now returned for my 4th or 5th time seeing Rebecca and it has always been a pleasant experience. The use of Aveda products and the head massage with the cut and color makes this an upscale experience. They always offer herbal tea and chocolate as you wait. As an at home mom, this is my refuge. I can easily book appointments in the afternoons which is ideal for me. The parking is a bit strange due to the building layout. I usually park across the street and have to cross Cheryl Drive which gets some speedy, on the go, talking on cellphone drivers leaving the subdivision. Please slow down people!",positive
"I have been going to Enlighten Studio for over five years now! Before Yvonne and the team, I never went to a salon more than twice ever in my life. But, Yvonne created the best look for me and my hair type and I am forever thankful! I'm going to be a client for life and have referred at least five other people who are now also regular clients. Yvonne is a master of color, on the leading edge of hair education and is one of the top stylists in the state.",positive
"I've been a customer of Enlighten Studio for almost 2 years. I get my hair cut, colored, or smoothed out on a regular basis, and its always a great experience. Yvonne is my stylist and she does a fantastic job, I love my hair! Yvonne put me totally at ease when i initially came in with damaged over processed hair. I have always been happy with the service at this salon. I can't say enough good things about this location!",positive
"If I could give zero stars I would. Yvonne and team where hired for my daughters wedding, we had nothing but trouble from the trial through to the wedding. The trial took over 5 hours; the team never completed my daughter's makeup or hair; they were unprepared and did not have the proper tools to complete a look. I was booked for a trial as well, my hair was done however, makeup was never attempted. Throughout the experience the team had many excuses; they couldn't do thin/fine hair, they couldn't do braids, they couldn't color-match the extensions they insisted my daughter needed. The day of the wedding they spent hours doing everyone but the bride. By the time they got to the bride it was a rushed job and the stylist had no idea how to style my daughter's hair. The bridal party had to completely redo the brides hair and makeup once we arrived at the venue delaying the entire timeline; because of the delay many pictures where lost which we can NEVER get back. We were very disappointed by the services we received. Yvonne was difficult to work with, unable to accept responsibility, hard to get in contact with, gives false hope and ultimately was unable to follow through on her promises. The biggest regret my daughter has for her wedding was choosing enlightened studios, don't make the same mistake.",negative
"I've been looking for a salon where I feel comfortable, get a good hair cut and highlights, and actually want to go back again. This place did just that for me today-easy to set up an appointment, no sales pitch for every product in the place (only what would help), and two ladies who really know their stuff. I had a partial highlight and a cut-Leah did a great job of blending the layers together better and gave me tips on how to section my hair for curling. If you ladies do any classes like you were mentioning, I'm totally there!",positive
"Really cute spot and a great location with plenty of parking in the back and on the street. Leah and the other stylist there were so incredibly friendly, it was a breath of fresh air just to sit and chat. It was a welcome escape from the pretension often found in Old Town. Not only was the atmosphere and company great, but Leah gave me a great haircut. I have curly hair and asked that she keep as much length as possible, but gave her free reign with the style. I left with pretty layers appropriate for my length and hair type, plus she managed to make my awful, grown-out self-cut bangs look like they were done on purpose. Can't wait to go back! Really a great find, and I love the online booking!",positive
"Yvonne is amazing!!! I gave my mother as a birthday present a consultation with Yvonne. Yvonne had to correct my mother's hair color. Her color and her hair cut were perfect!!! She's no longer want to color her own hair. Yay!!!! Yvonne just got a new client for life. On a side note, we moved here from Texas and visited several hair styles but no one compares to Yvonne's professionalism, knowledge, positive attitude and price.",positive
Enlighten Studios is awesome. Yvonne always has a positive attitude and does a fantastic job. I don't get anything fancy but she always takes time to style it and teach me as well. Would recommend 100%.,positive
Leah did a great job. She took time to figure out what I was looking for and also gave me tips on how to take care of my fair in this dry heat since I just moved here.,positive
"I have been going to Yvonne since 2005. Every time I have Yvonne cut and color my hair, I get so many compliments. I had an appointment before the 4th of July. We went to a party in Vegas, I received so many compliments, it was great. Yvonne takes a lot of time with each client, she is amazing! There's no one else like her!",positive
What a delightful experience! Yvonne was so knowledgeable and willing to take the time to explain information about my desires for hair color. Such an expert in her field! She's 100% real - no pretense here! Prices for services are below what you'd expect to pay in Scottsdale. I'm very impressed and pleased with my color and cut! Great appointment and I've got my next appointment booked! I found Enlighten Salon through Instant Barter. Thanks Yvonne!,positive
I have never had a more personal and friendly haircut before in my life. Yvonne took the time to ask basic questions about my lifestyle and past haircuts so she could tailor a personal cut to fit my needs. I was a little reluctant at first but I'm in love with my hair and the style far exceeded my expectations. No one else is allowed to touch my hair!!! Already booked my next appointment. I'll be back.,positive
"I've always had trouble figuring out my hair, especially since I stopped coloring. I'm mostly gray, so my hair has frizz issues and feels dry. Yvonne has an excellent intake form- she covers everything from your general lifestyle to exactly what you like and don't like about your hair. Then she sits and talks to you so she knows a little more about you. It helps her figure out a hair style that works for how you live. She also gave me many tips about taking care of gray hair and making it look and feel amazing. It was a great experience, and she has gained a new client because of how personal her service is.",positive
Best cut and color I have had in the 10 years living in Phoenix. I drove from San tan valley (1hour) just to have Yvonne and Leah do my hair. I am never going anywhere else again!,positive
Yvonne and the crew are Awesome! Personalized service and they do a great job. Yvonne really knows her stuff and is very talented.,positive
"If you're looking for a salon for everyday needs or for a special occasion (wedding) then you have found the answer with Enlighten Studio. I'm a wedding planner and I've used Enlighten Studio for a photo shoot, wedding clients, and personally. The service is top notch and I refer them with pride!",positive
"Enlighten Studio is the best salon of which you've never heard. Owner Yvonne has a heart as big as her talent. The time you spend at the Studio will fly by quickly as Yvonne entertains and resolves your bad hair issues simultaneously. The salon is easy to find, there's plenty of parking and the prices are super reasonable. You'll be happy that you went - I promise!",positive
I have a real sensitive scalp and have left other salons with my scalp feeling as if it was on fire. Yvonne at Enlighten Studio makes sure my scalp is rinsed really well and takes the time other salons haven't in the past to assure things are done right!,positive
This is one of my favorite places to go for me time! Enlighten never disappoints you and you will always feel like a million bucks when you leave! My son refuses to get his hair cut anywhere else! ;-),positive
I love this place! The staff is friendly and knowledgable and do a great job. The salon is clean and has a classic feel to it. Location has great parking.,positive
"Another great experience at Enlighten Studio yesterday! Had an appointment with Yvette for a 1/2 leg wax. Yvette was very personable, professional, and quick.",positive
"Yvonne at Enlighten Salon gave me my first first perm in over 15 years!! Shhh, don't tell because I recieved so many compliments that were as follows, ""You should quit straightening your hair, it looks beautiful natural!"" AWESOME!!!!",positive
"Mary Lou us accommodating and pleasant. The salon is clean, cozy, comfortable, and inviting. Have been a customer for almost 30 years and have never been disappointed in her precision cuts and other services.",positive
Mary Lou is by far the best hairdresser ever! Her attention to detail is superior!! I don't trust anyone else with my hair. Her cuts and styles are great but the color is exceptional.,positive
"I have been going to Mary Lou for over 10 years now for my hair and she is the best of the best! Not only does she have the most well kept, beautiful, and welcoming salon...but she is extraordinary at her craft. She loves her job and is passionate about making her clients feel their best! Mary Lou has become not only my stylist but one of my dear friends whom I look forward to catching up with at every hair appointment. I have moved away for college and for jobs and no matter how far away I am, I always come home to get my hair done because I know the end result will always be outstanding. I have not only experienced her skill and kindness first hand but have been privileged enough to see her interact with other clients with the most sincere, kind, caring, and welcoming spirit. Mary Lou's skill set in exceptional in all aspects including color, cut, styling, wax, color correction, and the list goes on. I would highly recommend her as well as her salon and I cannot say enough good things. There's a lot to say for an individual who is so talented at her work but also so passionate about her work!",positive
Been going to expressions and Mary Lou for years I highly recomend her. She always gives the best service with competitive prices.,positive
"Mary Lou operates her hair salon on the first floor of her 2-story Stow home. She provides service that is personal and dedicated. It is like visiting a good friend for coffee. She offers honest advice when clients ask for big changes or ""the usual."" The petite salon ambience is warm and homey with dark hardwood floors, a fireplace, complimentary coffee/herbal teas/soda. Prices are reasonable, ample off street parking, and expert care for male and females. Mary Lou's attention to detail keeps her ""regulars"" coming back--including me.",positive
"Not only did Dee get me in last-minute, she did an incredible job on my long, thick hair. I will update with further info once Jackie does my color next Monday.",positive
Had my hair colored and cut by Jackie. Clean beautiful salon and she and her mom could not have been nicer. She took the time to listen to my concerns and was able to fix a bad previous color. Will definitely be back again and will recommend to friends. Great find in the South Hills!,positive
Jackie and Dee are truly the best. I love my color and my daughter always feels like a million when Dee gets done cutting and styling her hair.,positive
"I made an appointment here after seeing the amazing reviews on Yelp. I was a bit nervous walking in because I've had trouble finding a good hair dresser, and have had many not so good haircuts. However, I was so happy when I walked out of the salon. Dee took the time to listen to me and what I wanted. She looked at my face shape and my hair type and gave me a haircut that I am beyond happy with. I will definitely be back!",positive
"This place is awesome. Its a family business run by 3 people. I went in for a haircut late evening and was pleasantly surprised. The service was top notch and the people were extremely nice as well. John is such a great person to talk to. For the quality of service they offer, the prices are extremely modest!... I would definitely recommend this place to everyone.",positive
"Great salon! Jackie is amazingly talented with hair color. My color was awful the first time I went to her, thanks to another salon messing the color up royally. Jackie took her time and talked to me about how I wanted my hair to look. She worked her magic and I am happy to say that my color now looks amazing and she was able to correct the bad color from before. I highly highly recommend this salon!!",positive
"I had dyed my hair in April and wanted to get it back to a natural color. I had no idea what to do, I went in to Jackie and she had me come in for a consultation to figure out what to do. She was so knowledgeable about what to do that we did it that day! She and Dee are delights to have service from. I went through the whole process of dyeing my hair and came out with a more than fantastic result. The shop is small, intimate, and well maintained so you know all of their attention is focused on you and getting the results you want. I highly recommend going here to get anything done. They are wonderful with their work and delights to be around!",positive
"Jackie was beyond phenomenal. I've never had a better cut, color and style in my life (I am from California and have been to some pretty spectacular fancy salons), plus it was more ""me"" than I could have imagined! Jackie took her time to get to know me and my personality and didn't have the pressure of get in and get out like most salons do. After talking for a little while she recognized me as a versatile person, which I completely am! I go to conservative functions but have a bit of a flare in my personality. We created a cut that I have never heard of- but am now in love with- and a color with both high and low lights that when worn in certain ways fits my flared personality and shows off more color. If I wear my hair at a different part it hides the bolder highlights and makes me presentable for conservative politics and Grandma (who also loved it but greeted me with ""Who is this stunning woman and where has my granddaughter gone!"") I can not say enough about how wonderful Jackie is! I had the time and so she took three and a half hours to get to know exactly what I wanted (even if I didn't know myself) cut to perfection, high and low lights in strategic positions, blow dry and curl all for less than a normal set of highlights costs at other salons!! My only complaint is I live in Aspen Colorado and she is not there! I will be visiting her every time I visit family in PA!",positive
"This small salon is operated by the talented Dee and her equally talented daughter Jackie. Jackie colors and Dee cuts. Jackie's coloring is great - every job is a work of art as she works her magic. Dee's cuts are great - I have very fine hair, and she always makes the best of it. Every client I see leaving the place looks awesome.",positive
This updated review is not for any person that works there or services received. It is for walking through the door and greeted pleasantly enough then promptly asked if I had an appointment. I do not. It is two-thirty and I am gleefully told I cannot he seen until 4:30 PM. It clearly states walk-ins welcome on the door. I guess just not today. I am currently at Great Clips this high is a mile up the road. Granted they don't do color only cuts and on a Sunday morning my weight is 20 minutes. I received a cut I'm super happy with so it worked out well.,negative
I have been bringing my boys there for some time and each time I go-they tend to get worse in cutting my kids hair. I end up going back home evening out the side and back. It's so frustrating. I would have paid them but since it was close to Christmas I paid but I will not be going back there again.,negative
I will never go here or to any fantastic sams ever again. I went in for a hair cut with layers. They didn't blow dry it so when I got home I dryed my hair and it looked horrible! The layers were SO short and straight acr,negative
"Casey- my ""stylist""- was obviously not into being at work, I believe he was sick, so I gave him the benefit of the doubt. We spoke not a word during my haircut. Fine by me. It was weird he kept having me turn my head all the way to the right and all the way to the left. I've never had a stylist ask that before. My cut was a bit shorter than I wanted but it's hair and it will grow. What's not ok is after my first wash I noticed just how bad the cut is. Not even at all. I wanted a straight cut, no layers. Simple. The front pieces are two different lengths. The back is at least 3 lengths. This was the worst cut I've had in my 30 years of life and that's saying a lot considering I lived through the 90s with bangs. I used to get great cuts at the Location on Stephanie St in Henderson. Will not return to this location.",negative
"It was our first time here. We usually go somewhere else, but realized we pay so much there but always get a crappy cut! We didn't have an appointment, but literally waited for 2 minutes before someone got started on my son. Gabby (sp?) did an awesome job. Showed her a picture of what he wanted, and I knew it would be kind of difficult being that he had a MoHawk and wanted to transition to a side sweep type cut. She explained exactly how she'd do it and what would be the best way and did her thang! I mean, it wasn't anything spectacular, I'm sure she does this all the time, but My son loves it, that's all that matters! Everyone there was friendly and engaged with their clients, it was nice.",positive
Michael is amazing! We got him by chance and insist on seeing him every time now! Haircuts exactly what we want! Spends quality time! A treat to go get a good scalp massage & haircut! Color is great- even fixed a co-worker's mistakes! Pampering on a budget- this is the place to go!,positive
I was ignored for 1&1/2 hours because I had a beard and long hair. Stylists are lazy and don't care about losing customers . I would rather pay the extra money to go somewhere else where I would be appreciated and welcome.,negative
"Tried new hair place to get my hair cut. Young guy cut my hair. Clearly new at cutting hair. Poor job, didn't trim sideburns or clean the hair on the back of my neck. He even argued with me when I asked him to take more off the top. Went back to my regular stylist the next day and got my hair properly cut. My stylist and I had a good laugh and i promised not to try anymore new stylist. Fantastic Sam lose my number.",negative
"From entering the front door to being done with my haircut, under 5 minutes elapsed! It took me longer to get there than to get my hair cut, which is a win for me. I requested a pretty simple chop, and they did it, and fast. The going rate for a cut is $14.99, and you can get a 10% discount by checking in on yelp, or for you seniors out there, 10% off on services MTW. Pretty cheap. Lots of lot parking and friendly staff to be found inside. I will definitely be back if I need another haircut while I'm in the area.",positive
This has been my go to salon for the last two years. Jaqueline is truly talented and does an amazing job on my hair. The prices are fantastic and the wait times are minimal. All of the employees are professional and really friendly.,positive
Went in Feb 10 for a perm... I get one a year. My hair is straight at the ends and looks awful. Went back in and she conditioned it and cut some off but its still straight. I'm really disappointed by my experience. I've never had my hair turn out like this before.,negative
"Obviously everyone is picky about their hair, as it is your appearance and I have had some very bad experiences with highlighting and cuts in my 55 years. I just moved to the N. Las Vegas area approx. 6 weeks ago and saw this Fantastic Sams and decided to pray and hope that I would get a good result to get my hair highlighted and cut. I had ""Crystal"" as my hair stylist. I couldn't be more happy and pleased!!!!! Turned out perfect color I wanted and I feel and look great and she is hired. Lol. I will go back to her when it's time for a re-cut or touch up. She fussed and curled and made me feel and look great when I was done. Thank you Crystal, Great Job!!!!!! :)",positive
"Jacqueline was the best! I was able to walk right in for a cut and color. Everyone was cheery and pleasant even though it was 9 am on a Saturday. I was so nervous about cutting my long hair and worried that because I didn't know exactly what I wanted, I'd end up unhappy. This couldn't be further from the truth! Not only did Jacqueline help me pick a great color, she listened to my ramblings about what I was basically looking for in a cut. The finished result was amazing! I really couldn't be happier and will definitely be going back.",positive
Went to fantastic Sams on Ann Rd crystal was my stylist wow she is amazing I'm so happy i love my cut and color best i have ever got in my life.. i highly recommend her best experience thank you so much i will let my friends know and i well be back...,positive
"I took my 4 year old son in for a haircut. When I left, his hair was still wet, and when it dried, it was completely uneven everywhere! Not to mention the fact that the girl used thinning shears on him and he said the haircut hurt! Not wanting to go back to the same girl, I called them and they told me to come at 10 in the morning and the manager would fix it. My husband took our son back at 10 am and was told that the manager was not there, but on her way. At 10:45, she still had not shown up and my husband finally left. I have had a couple of nice, professional hair cuts there, but the black woman with the gap in her teeth (I do not know her name) is terrible. IF you decide to take your chances here, avoid her at all costs!",negative
"Located at the corner of Ann and Decatur, this relatively new Fantastic Sam's location may have become my new home for haircuts. One of the hardest things for me to find has been consistency and my do is really quite basic. I think I may have found it! Tabitha took care of me this time, but I've had both Crystal and Tabitha on previous visits. They are both ""fantastic"" and I have been pleased with the do every time. Granted they are still offering grand opening prices, but where else can you get a decent haircut and a relaxing shampoo for twelve bucks? I can't comment on their products or other services such as hair coloring or styling for long hair, but for me and my short hair, this was a four star experience.",positive
You have to ask for jackie. She's awesone. Plus when I went there was a deal on all cuts. So my hair cut was only 11$. I drove all the way from Henderson. And did I mention Jackie is awesome!,positive
"I had a $34.99 coupon for ""all over hair color"" at this Fantastic Sams location only. I drove there to give it a try. Before I entered, there was a banner outside ""Hair color $39.99"". A lady ""Tabitha"" was at the counter. I told her that I was there for an all over hair color. She immediately said, ""It's $49.99."" I said, ""I have a coupon for $34.99. Besides, the banner outside said $39.99."" She said, ""That price is for short hair. Long hair extra."" My hair length is only a little below my earlobes! I said, ""Mine is short! This is way above shoulder. I thought shoulder length and below is considered long hair."" She said, ""Did you go to beauty school?"" I probably should have left with that first clue. But the way she said it was soft, and it could be a real question, so I answered, ""I heard that from other hair places."" She then said with my coupon, she would give me the $5 discount to make it $44.99. I agreed as I was already there. My hair dye task is an easy, all over black color. Other places had asked me what type of black (brownish, reddish, blue, straight, etc.) and sometimes show samples of colors but she never bothered and just went ahead with a black color. Shortly after she started with me, a customer walked in. She left me and went to ask that lady what's needed and told that lady, ""I will be ready for you in 20 minutes once I am done with her."" I had never had hair coloring for only 20 minutes. Surely, it was more than 20 minutes when she left me for that lady, but she did not finish half of my hair. She spent 40 minutes with the lady before she came back to finish coloring my hair. I don't believe that's the correct way to do it as the whole head has two different coloring time. Along the side of my face was painted a thick layer of black color during this time. Since she didn't use any hair clips but just held different bunches by hand (with gloves), some piles dropped on my face and left black marks right on the face. Finally she washed my hair. I was hoping all the black ink would be gone. But no, it was lighter but obvious along the side of my face and some still on the face. Knowing how the front looked like, I asked to see my back with a hand-held mirror and there was the same black ink on my neck. I asked her to please clean the color, she again used soft voice to refuse, ""I can't get rid it. I can't. I can't."" I thought I heard it wrong. When I asked again, she again said, ""I can't do it. I can't. I can't."" Even her co-worker heard her soft argument, and told her, ""Use the color remover."" which was a bottle right on the counter. She reluctantly used it a little bit, but insisted that the ink would go away by itself later, not now. I also softly inquired, ""How would the color go away by itself if I don't do anything?"" She insisted, ""It just would."" I didn't ask anymore. I paid her $45 cash, she didn't bother giving change. Upon my request for a receipt, she gave me one that noted for the additional charge, ""Extra Length Color $10"". Anyone in this world would not call my way above shoulder hair ""long"", let alone ""extra length"". My hair was still dripping wet when I left the store because when I asked her if it could be blow dried a little more, she said it's an extra $10. Conclusions about this place: 1) Dishonest about the coupon offer 2) Took over two hours for the simplest hair dye task 3) Didn't have the skills or concern to take care customers' needs 4) Refused to clean up the dye on customer's face - first time I ever encountered",negative
"The day before Christmas, I took my daughter in to get her hair dyed black. I wasn't thrilled about that idea, but agreed as long as she left a few lighter strands here & there. Well, the lady that did her hair did mostly black, but some spots were blue, some were purple & there was a strange square of an awful brown on the left side of my daughter's head. Not sure why she did that as it doesn't equal streaks of lighter color throughout. ??? I had to put my daughter on a plane the next day to fly to the East coast, so there was no time to fix it. Her stepmother put a box of black on & it looked decent until it started to fade. I took her in not long after for a trim & to see if we could get the color fixed & they said it will have to grow out. She needed a trim last weekend & was REALLY wanting to get her color fixed. The blonde lady that finally helped us said that I should've brought her in the next day! I told her it's probably not a good idea to violate a court order (she was going to visit her father for the holiday). Then she said it was going to cost $80 for the 1st hour & $50 each addtitional hour to try to fix it. I pointed out that THEY were the ones who screwed it up in the first place. She didn't care. NEVER again will those people touch our hair! We will NOT be back!",negative
"Went in for a haircut at 4:00 was taken by Angela at 4:30 and by 5:40 my hair was chopped! I asked for long layers, got nothing layered only uneven, slanted at an angle chopped up hair at the bottom! I asked for bangs after 3 times asking she still didn't do it right! My hair is atrocious & I'm ferrous! Thanks NOT SO FANTASTIC SAMS!!!!!",negative
"I went in there to get my teenagers some haircuts. My son is very particular about his hair and we could never find a person who did his hair to his liking. As I watched Jacqueline cut, actually assess (she didnt even start cutting yet) his hair, I knew she would do a great job. I was right. My son was quite pleased. I was so impressed, I asked her to cut my hair. She even gave me a lavender/mint scalp massage! I am so glad I went there. The lady who cut my daughter's hair did an excellent job as well. We will definitely return from now on. I'm so glad to have found a place with conscientious hairstylists!",positive
"Returned for a haircut and employee #281, sorry forgot the name and that is the only ID on the ticket. Great service from the employee. She talked to me about the cut all the way through. She made sure I was happy with each step. She was very professional and knew what she was doing. I could not be happier and it makes me look good. Love the cut.",positive
"This place is always great. Kristina has been cutting my hair forever (over 5,6 years) and the last couple times she hasn't been there and I still get a good haircut. This time I went in and there was an older blonde lady wearing a Silver dog tag, hair back in a pony tail who was kinda rude & stressed me out she talked about religion. She smelt like cigarettes & kept asking things about my hair that she didn't even end up doing. I told her to keep it long & she wanted to cut an inch off the top... ok I told her I wanted a separation and a hard part, didn't get either.... My hair cut is probably the worst one I've ever gotten from here (still better than some places) but the level of stress and uneasiness I felt just during the entire process was bad. I'm going home and shaving my head. If you go here get anyone but this lady. The rest of the staff is good but I won't e coming back for fear I'll get her again. Sorry Kristina I've been a client of yours for a long time but I can't support a place that employs people like her.",negative
Kris was extremely helpfull she gave me one of my best hair cuts. She was extremely knowledgeable and took her time. Also I must say she was easy on the eyes as well. I recommend this place and ask for kris,positive
"Terrible. Never recommend this place. How does something like this even stay in business? I told the girl what I wanted and it was so butchered I actually asked to have the last of what was left of my hair, shaved down with a number 1 on the trimmers. Not even remotely close to what I asked for. And oh wow...they gave me a discounted rate...after destroying my hair. I paid just so I could leave. Been waiting weeks now so I can go see my regular barber. Never again, do not recommend going here, even of you are trying to save a couple dollars. I was told I would regret it, and I sure do regret going here. I would give zero stars if I could",negative
I've been going here for over two years and Christina has been the best and I always leave satisfied with her service. She is the best!,positive
Extremely disappointed with the result of my haircut. Should've know I would've got this service with a 10 dollar haircut.,negative
Olga does a fabulous job with color and she really understands how to style fine hair! Love my new blonde highlights and she is so helpful with tips and styling products.,positive
Savannah was one of the most personable people that have ever cut my hair. I took a chance booking an appointment somewhere ive never been but the reviews and photos online made me feel this could be a good place and boy was i right. I worked in customer serivce a long time and she is an asset! Thank you!!!,positive
Love this place!! I get my hair done by Olga she is amazing! I am very picky about who I let color/ cut my hair and I completely trust her. I used to have such a hard time getting the exact color I wanted. When she colored it the first time it was perfect.,positive
Thank you Angela for all your work getting us all ready for Haleys Sweet Sixteen. You are amazing. We love the beautiful shop. Seeing Santa was an Extra bonus.,positive
"I went to this salon and my stylist was Casi, she was very nice and did a great job cutting my hair, definitely going back to see her or Bonnie. The salon is quiet and personable",positive
"Love this salon! Great staff, great services! Glad we finally have a decent full service salon in the Indian trail area! Very clean and professional! Second to None!!",positive
"woOoOooOow, they have a great costumer service and the lady's they work over there are so nice to costumer . anyone needs threading eyebrows needs to ask for lily over there she will taker of all u need",positive
"Love going there always do a wonderful job. Will keep going back to these guys any time I need my hair done. The staff is great and always up to the task of giving you the perfect look. Be it color, perms, sets or just a simple cut they can do it! They have just started taking appointments online or over the phone so can now do that to make it easier and quicker. So head over today!",positive
Miss Saundra and miss Maggie are very very nice. It's a little hidden but it's awesome I love what they did to my hair the color stayed very well,positive
I went to this salon for my ayebrows! Lily did it for me! I'd like her personality! She was really perfesional and nice .she fixed my brows and perfect shape I want ! Tnx lily! I definitely come back,positive
"I have been coming to this salon for 23 years now and have never had bad service! I have very thick hair, combined with the medicines I take, makes it very difficult to correctly perm! Maggie, the owner of the salon, always gets my hair just right! Today, I had my hair permed and it came out gorgeous! I can't wait for my husband to see my hair. He will love it! I come here for my hair to be colored and permed and would go nowhere else!",positive
Never ever ever in the history of life should anybody go here my hair was passed my butt i asked for layers around my face and the girl chopped my hair off on the left side of my head i have no layers i had to stop her and walk out with my hair chopped on 1 side i feel so stupid walking around looking like this it embarrassing and its so short it doesnt even go back in a pony tail all i can do is cry when i left .... plz plz plz people dont look for discounts when it comes to your hair just pay the higher price so it can be done by a professional because i feel so ugly right now,negative
"I went there all excited & bought a big package deal. $33 for a haircut, shampoo, style, hot oil deep-conditioning treatment, and gloss. They didn't do deep-conditioning treatment or hot oil which was really disappointing since I was looking to spoil myself by treating my hair. She put one or two spritz of oil in my hair. Plus I had to pay $20 more since my hair was a little longer than shoulder length even though she cut a bunch of it off! I think it's just not worth it!",negative
"I was on groupon and saw something for this salon. I bought it and went. The day i had my appt, one of the girls called in, leaving 2 working. They were super busy but managed to take care of every client that walked in the door, including myself..and they did a beautiful job with my hair. I had sandra and maggie both. They both are experienced and are very friendly. did a great job w.my cut color and highlight!",positive
"I will never go to another hair place in Las Vegas. You cannot beat the prices and quality of hair care. I drive 35 minutes just to go here and it is entirely worth it. I have never had a stylist pay as much attention to what I want and willing to make awesome suggestions before... and for almost half as much as I am used to paying. Shana is a rockstar so I make appointments with her, but they do walk-ins too. I always feel comfortable there. No this isn't some fancy pants salon with new furniture and crazy elite style ambiance so to some it's probably outdated or ugly. But I'm not paying for the aesthetics... I'm paying for my hair to look fabulous, which it always does! They take the extra time and are kind. Service A+. Also, look for groupons, that's how I started here!",positive
"Saw the ad on Groupon seemed like a good deal. Went to get color and highlights and a cut. Great haircut and color services done. The building was a little dated if your a person where that matters and if that does matter it shouldn't the service and friendliness of the staff especially ""JAVONA"" she was the one that styled my hair. She gave great recommendations for me to use when selecting hair product and was very conversational. My husband took me here for me to get a whole new hair do for our anniversary. This was a great gift. JAVONA really knows what she's doing and I highly recommend Fiesta family hair if you live there locally and especially is your visiting. No the place is not on the strip but it is a short drive and will leave a lasting impression of what service is and the quality of color and style of hair that JAVONA does is simply the best in town. If your reading this review stop reading and call JAVONA already and make an appointment.",positive
"I bought a groupon and found fiesta hair. A bit far but totally worth it.Best at everything especially blow dry. I have also had cuts, color and highlights.i love them and my hair is hard to deal with. I love jovanie but everyone there is great and they are good at what they do. If u live in vegas or visiting, do give them a try. U wont be disappointed!",positive
I got my hair done by Danielle on my birthday. I have dry & frizzy hair. She did a fantastic job. It made my day. Thanks Danielle for such wonderful experience.,positive
"Thanks Danielle for the new hairstyle. I needed a change and this is the shortest I have gone in a long time. My haircut is still feminine which I love and I have some versatility in how I will style. I also appreciate the recommendations on product. I am a little apprehensive on creating beach waves but, practice will make perfect. I am thankful Danielle doesn't let me get too impulsive with color, She is aligned with my hair goals. Danielle also never lets me leave with a wet head- my biggest pet peeve in any hair salon. Thanks Danielle!",positive
"Mischa is the best! I used to work with her, she did my hair then and still does now! It's always a pleasure and she is great at what she does... If you want to look great and feel great when you leave go and see Mischa.",positive
"Same as the other reviewer, I've been following my hair stylist Mischa on and off for about 15+ years! What's cool is that a lot of the other stylists there have also been at the same salons as her that are there now. It's always neat, clean and everyone there is very welcoming! :)",positive
"I have been following my stylist around for 15+ years and this is where she currently resides.... This salon was opened and is run by stylists. It is in the same complex as Honey Baked Ham and Hobby Lobby. It is a decent size salon and offers the hometown, shop around the corner where all the ladies go, hair salon feel that is often lacking in a lot of the frilly ""hip"" salons covering the Valley. Don't get me wrong though, this place is clean, well appointed, and modern; definitely a great place to meet your beauty needs! Here is hoping for great success & Happiness amongst clients new and old!!",positive
My tuna was so over-cooked that I couldn't break it apart to try to eat it...sent it back only to wait 45 minutes for a margarita pizza which came out cold - it was quite disappointing. We will not return...,negative
I brought my father here to try to burger and he loved it--they even cut it down the middle so we could share. The sweet potatoe fries were his and my favorite accompanied by what I think was aioli sauce. Overall it was a great dining experience and the vibe/decor was an added bonus. Definitely worth trying if you're in the area.,positive
"Food is great, great atmosphere bartender Kerri does great job. Puts up with our crazy demands and always has a smile on her face...",positive
The mac n cheese was perfect! The burgers were a little over cooked but our server didn't even ask how we wanted them cooked. I'm crazy for toppings on my burger but there is a point when it's too much.,negative
"Note: My opinions are somewhat consistent with other posters below who indicated that they really liked Flipside in the past, however, as of late not so much. I'm officially in that camp now. Went on a Wednesday evening around 6:00 pm. Other than about 7 folks milling around the bar area, there was only one other couple in the whole dining area. I was very shocked - for prime time dining hour. That to me is communicating a message - you who management, you may want to note this. I understand it was Wednesday and it would not be overly crowded, but I expected others besides just one lone couple - at the prime dinner hour. I did note from their beer list that they are about $1- $2 higher on their drafts than most everyone else. I had the Flipside pale ale collaboration with Lucky Owl from Chagrin Falls. Usually when it is your ""house brew"", you price it less than all the others. No so here - $6 which was the same as some others. I had the special - chicken banh mi - $12. Considering they were touting all the different items on the sandwich - slaw, cilantro, aioli, jalepenos, etc. - I was expecting a flavor burst. No such luck. I'd say the sandwich was relatively tasteless. For $12, which is a steep price for a chicken sandwich, it better sing and be very good. This was quite far from it. My dining companions had the ""Say Cheese"" burgers which are essentially $8.50 burgers. No complaints although my wife (who also was a big fan of Flipside) did comment that she recently had a few burgers elsewhere that were better than this. Ordered a plain fry and an order of onion rings. Oddly, these came out before the meal and the girl that brought them out said that our meals are ""right behind this"". Well, they must have got lost because they probably came out, what seemed to be, 10 min. later. Fries and rings were good. I fell in love with the fries previously, but I could say, not with this batch. Note: No where during this time did the waitress come by to check and give us assurance the our meals would be coming. Overall, for what they charge - which is top dollar - the finished product needs to stand out and execute, I could say this was not the case here, at all. I think it will be a vey long while before I give Flipside another chance.",negative
"The Kobe beef corn dogs were awesome and their milkshakes look tasty, but this place is extremely overpriced. $12 for a mediocre burger and at least $6 for most beers. There's nothing unique about this place that sets it apart from the many other burger joints in the Cleveland area.",negative
Great tasting burgers. Nice atmosphere. Good choices for draft beers and knowledgeable staff about their product. I'll be back.,positive
Went to call in a order of a burger and two sides of fries and a salad at 9:30pm 2/20/17 and was told the kitchen was closed .. it says that the hours for tonight for the rocky river location are till 10:00pm I was confused and dumbfounded frankly if I were to of drove all the way there would I have been turned away at the door? That's bad business in my opinion and I feel like the last few times I have gone into this location the wait staff were rude and acted like they really didn't want to be there. I'm deeply saddened by this as the food is amazing but because of this I'm going to have to part ways with this location it's just disappointing. I hope this comment reaches someone who cares because it just seem like no one does.,negative
"Everything we ordered here was fantastic! I would go here again just for the spectacular creme brulee beer! We ordered the Brie burger and brisket mac and cheese and it did not disappoint! The only negative thing was that it was a Friday night and it was completely dead, we thought it was closed!",positive
"Well, if burgers are gonna be your thing you should probably do a better job at it. Ordered the forester burger and a side of truffle fries. Fries were fine, crispy, hot and lots of them. The burger on the other hand...small greasy as hell patty on a basic giant eagle seasame bun with some ""grilled mushrooms"" that were over cooked and basically reheated. The sautéed onion was mushy and like something you would get at a ballpark. No condiments except for aoli with horseradish in it which we all know is just whipped mayo. Soggy single piece of lettuce, 2 pickles and a average Tomato slice. All that for $13? Skip it and hit five guys instead. At least it's relatively fresh and predictable for a good price.",negative
"Delicious, messy burgers- a must try!! Don't forget to try the truffle fries with a side of truffle aioli. Amazing! One of my favorite burger spots in the Cleveland area.",positive
"The concept is great and the original in hudson ohio was awesome but while it started out as a good place with good food, the place has gone waaaaay downhill! I and many others have described how horrible the service has been we tried it one last time tonight after a few bad experiences and odds are we won't be back! The waiter said he knew little about the draft list since they just changed it and he wasn't interested in finding answers to our questions! Friends have talked about how the servers were not attentive at all and my wife mentioned how she called the manager over a few weeks ago about an issue and the manager looked at her and said ""oh sorry about that"" and walked away! A friend told me it's no different from going to McDonalds......just costs a lot more!",negative
"Oh my gosh. So good!! I had to be a plain Jane and get the say cheese burger and it was incredible! I added avocado to it and it was the best seasoned and cooked burger I have ever had. We had the chili cheese fries to share and they were different but so freaking good. To top off our meal, we ordered a chocolate milkshake and they split it between my husband and I without us asking. One of the best milkshakes I've ever had, and that's the truth. I cannot wait to go back soon and try something new!",positive
"Pretty plain food, nothing really stood out to me. If I ever went back I would skip on any of their drinks and just get a burger. There may be some hidden gems on the menu but from what I've experienced it's just OK.",negative
Got the house burger.it reminded me of a school lunch burger.the bun was old the burger was not seasoned and the onion stuff( caramelized?) Was poopy.it came with a condiment which was unique.not in a tasty way.got the fries with cheese.it was edible .my friends got a mushroom gravy on their fries.it was mushroom juice.gross.also had onion rings and they were not seasoned.would not go back wendys is way better.not a joke,negative
"didn't love it as much as i did the first time (in Hudson), but it was still good. this time my burger seemed to be overwhelmed by the bitter taste of the grilled onions and the fries seemed to be the nubs that get left in the fryer basket all night. i liked the physical restaurant more though, to be honest. i think i'd choose it over Hudson for that reason but i may get a different burger next time.",positive
So to say this is my new favorite burger place sounds like an exaggeration since I am a total lover of B Spot but it is. This is our second time here and my second time having the One Red Door Burger. It's the best burger I have EVER had!!!! My hubby had the Chili Pepper Burger. Said it wasn't as spicy as the name implies yet it was delicious!!! Sorry I didn't post pics but the margarita got the better of me! The onion rings are superb and the fries are also good. I would totally recommend this place!!!!,positive
The grouper sandwich is just as good as you can get in Florida!!! Meaty and grilled to perfection!!!!! Flown in fresh.,positive
"Flip Side burgers are the best! We usually go to the location in Hudson. The first time we tried the location in Rocky River, they were super accommodating with trying to get us out of there quickly so we could make our movie. The staff was very helpful and friendly, and the food was delicious.",positive
"Succulent burger but the real star here is the sweet potato fries. Unlike others served everywhere else in this county, these, I believe, are fried and then seasoned with savory herbs. I believe they are fried, perhaps twice, in peanut oil. I thought these were the best prepped and served sweet fries I've ever had, and I've sampled many. Burger very juice, yummy, great quality beef plus very rich and satisfying.",positive
This was our second time at The Flipside. Both times the best burger we have ever had and the best cooked. Our kids even thought it was the best burger. The onion rings were perfectly cooked also. The bartender and our server we excellent too. thanks again.,positive
Had the California Turkey Burger. They are usually bland and dry but no here at Flip Side. The turkey burger was just as good as a regular burger if not better. I will come here again.,positive
"Haven't taken a bite of my food and already know I won't be back. If you're incapable of accommodating to-go orders don't offer them. Was told 25-30 minutes. Got there at 30 minutes then stood there for another 25 minutes because ""a big order came in."" Burgers take 5 minutes to cook, and there's no way these will be good enough for me to come back after this first experience. Might as well update after eating: fries were ice cold, as though they put them in a box when we ordered then forgot they made us wait an hour. Burger was tasteless and my toppings I ordered were missing. I threw half of it away. Seriously, don't bother with this place.",negative
"Nothing less than a five star, wish there was more options! Server, Stephen, hands down out of all the restaurant I go, best server in Cleveland! Everything from the fries to the drinks are perfect! Get in and try everything!",positive
I love this place sooo much. Burgers are phenomenal service is good. The food taste like it was made with love. I will def be goin back serval times a week!! also the chefs are sexy,positive
We both had the Flip Side burger and it was delicious. I didn't like the smell if the metal tables. The service was friendly but not attentive.,negative
The food was ok. I had the bison burger which wasn't great. It needed more flavor. The portobello on it was soaked in vinegar. Someone in my party had the crab cake and it was too salty. The margaritas were too sour and were more like drinking straight lime juice. It was disappointing especially since it was my birthday. The customer service was on point but the food and drink were not. I wanted this place to be awesome. Hopefully they work out the kinks.,negative
"Service was great, burgers were good, onion rings were good, French fries were ok. Cobb salad was good but dressing was just ok. Bloody Mary was horrible, do not order it. Tasted like watered down tomato juice. Very noisy so not the place for a romantic evening.",negative
"Great service, amazing food, wide selection of craft beers and specialty drinks. The food is fresh, made from scratch. Grass fed beef, fresh cut fries, and everything is made to order!",positive
"Their burgers are good.. If your standard is Applebee's or tgif but there's no contest going up against similarly priced local spots like Deagan's, Forage or Lolita. Also, what kind of burger restaurant does not cook their burgers to order?",negative
"I've been getting haircut here for the past year now. Johonny always takes care of me and makes my hair look very clean. Fun, laid back atmosphere with music always playing and sports on tv. Make sure to call and make an appointment if you can because they can get pretty busy quickly. I mean these guys are in the best barbershop in Vegas so I'm not surprised. And try to bring cash if you can! Remember, cash is king!",positive
"Definitely the best barber shop in Vegas in my opinion I've been going to my barber Jose Luis for 8 years never been disappointed with the quality of cut or service and the other barbers in the shop are Masters at their craft also literally can cut all hair textures and styles and for the quality of service you receive the price is excellent cuts starting at $17 with the razor lineup, cut and beard trim starting at $35 I've been to places not mentioning any names where a cut starts at $25 and they don't even line you up with a razor so I recommend Flow Barbershop to any and everyone.",positive
"I was visiting Las Vegas from New York and I follow this guy through Instagram and I went there to the barbershop without appointment and I waiting like 30 to 45 minutes. After that I got the best service, facial, hair cut, beard and everything was done perfect. I like the style of the barber, they are so nice and happy people, of course Latin. I got not complain for my service. I completely recommend this barbershop to everyone. Good customer service and pleasant barbers.",positive
"Amazing job on my hair, Oslen is very friendly, he helped me to get a new design on my hair and I really like it, I 100% recommend this guy and this place",positive
Been getting my haircut once a week from Richy for a good while now. Always does an amazing job. Great attitude and atmosphere here. Highly recommend,positive
"Okay. Let me just say these gentlemen don't speak English very well. And that's fine, except the guy didn't understand me when I told him how to cut my hair. I told him very simply I wanted 2 inches on the top and 1 on the sides. So he shaves me almost bald. Now, this is only the beginning. I go to pay and they want 17 dollars for this haircut which is outrageous. I wanted to pay with my debit card but couldn't because apparently there's only one guy who knows how to work the machine and he wasn't there. So I was forced to use the atm which charges you two bucks to use and pay cash (which I wasn't told, what if I was paying with a credit card?). I could only take 20 out so I did, then proceeded to pay the guy and awaited my change, which, go figure, he didn't have any change. So I just gave him the 20 and left (basically being forced to tip him for a bad haircut.) I wouldn't recommend anyone go here for a haircut, unless you wanna get your hair screwed up and pay more than you should for it.",negative
I'm hair cut here today. And i show them picture about what I want to do but they're cut my hair so short. And when they're cut my hair talking and stop for talk so many time. (I just say good and nothing to say walking out) No next time for me.,negative
"1st time I take my 7 year old to a barber and was not disappointed at all . Drove by this place and read the reviews in google and decided to stop in . They took us as a walk in and the guys are very friendly, great atmosphere and customer service . The price was very reasonable . Camilo did an amazing job, we will be coming back, I recommend",positive
"Scheduled haircut for a specific time just to walk out without a haircut due to s heckled barber still cutting prior guys head 20 min into my scheduled time. It's cool, I just won't go back.",negative
"I was there with my son, with no appt and the owner take care of me and he is do a very nice haircut for my son. I recommend this place to any moms is a nice place, clean and very good customer service and very patience with the kids.",positive
"Was a first time visitor a couple days ago and while the place looks nice, the barber did a sloppy job with my haircut. It was easy to tell he was rushing my cut and after looking in the mirror I realized there were very many mistakes done. Some hairs were noticeably shorter and uneven on the front and sides. I would not recommend this place if you do not like to feel rushed and want a thorough job with your haircut.",negative
"This place was fantastic. It was like walking into a clean and pristine hospital, except to get your hair cut. They were extremely friendly from the very beginning. I could have (and almost did) fall asleep during my cut. Richy did such an amazing job on giving me a fresh cut, that I'm already going to be going back. I honestly can't wait.",positive
Got my Haircut from Pedro the Barber . He was the master Barber indeed. Gave me a Great Pompadour with his master Barber skills will definitely come again and invite my co workers and friends to come to this place everyone always says hello and welcomes everyone greatly . Got the spanish vibe but with great music . Till next time,positive
"Excellent barbers that take their work as serious as family honor. Prices are reasonable for the high quality you get, and everyone very polite. Be warned however, you may go in as a young lad, but you will come out eligible for social security -- i.e. the wait for service is very long. Best to make an appointment.",positive
"Just walked in and got my hair cut by Richy. The shop definitely has strong hispanic/ethnic vibes but white people this place is for you too! I enjoyed the professional atmosphere, nice music, but most of all my result. Richy was very quick and efficient but also took his time to make sure everything was on point. He gave me just what I wanted plus some. You can tell he has artistic pride in what he does. I got such a professional service for such a good price. I will definitely be back!",positive
"My boyfriend and I did a walk in (for him of course) and he saw Pedro, no wait on a Sat AWESOME! His hair cut is perfect",positive
"Awesome barbershop, everything to the clean environment to the professional barbers, they provide excellent advise and always deliver on anything you ask for, and the pricing is fair for anyone.",positive
Woowww came all the way from Manchester England for the fight mayweather mcgreggor thought I'd get my haircut while I was there the week. I'm a barber myself with my own shop. I went here bad bad haircut I told him I wanted a high fade and he done it sooo low and bad didn't even want to cut the top wouldn't show me the haircut with the Mirror and the whole time wouldn't talk a really bad atmosphere just kept talking Spanish to the owner / other barber pair of wankers then tried charging me $40 dollars couldn't advise you anymore sooo bad and so arrogant,negative
"These guys just opened but I've been going to them for almost 10 years, to Jilson, when the owners of this barber shop used to work at Gerardos. They do a great job which is why I've been coming back, and do a better job than any of the higher end places or in the casinos, so I'm always happy to tip them more as its well deserved. Definitely check these guys out, they're honestly some of the best guys in town.",positive
"Richy the barber is the best barber in Las Vegas, never had a problem with him and I have been cutting my hair with him for many years . He is very professional, friendly environment, clean restrooms, clean floors & I definitely recommend if you are in Vegas and in need of quick haircut you won't regret .",positive
"I've been getting my hair cut by Johnny for over 10 years now. I am glad that he moved to this location along wit Ricky and Jilson. The 3 of them are master barbers. At one point or another I have gotten my haircut by both Rick and Jilson, when my barber is on vacation. I always feel confident of both of them. I do not have to worry about the quality of haircut, because they know how to do any stile out there. I love this new location, everything looks amazing and clean. I've been to a lot of barber shops, because I travel a lot and t is the first barber shop that I've been to that has Wifi, AWESOME!!! I highly recommend this location to everyone in between kids to seniors. Remember to book an appointment to get top notch service, because the 3 of them are mostly solid booked. I've never had a problem with my appointments, they always begin on time. Thanks for the exceptional service provided to me throughout the year. I wish the 3 of you success for a life time.",positive
"Great shop! Very clean and excellent haircut received. The service was prompt I just walked in and got right in. Haircut is very clean and the barber took his time to ensure the perfect cut. I am not from the area, but wish there was a shop this nice in my hometown.",positive
I called and asked when I could come they said you could come now and then I ended up waiting for like an hour and a half even though I asked him if I could come in the back and the attitude that was given to me and I was really really unprofessional,negative
Great new barber shop right across the street from the Palms casino!! Ritchie is a great barber! He spent 20-30 minutes cutting my hair. Most places try to rush you through a cut. Flow Barber is very clean and open. I highly recommend this new barber shop to both locals and visitors!!,positive
Best barber I ever been did my haircut exactly how I ask for it nice place very clean happy I found this barber won't change it,positive
new clean shop. I've been getting cut by Richie the owner for 2 years. He's been very consistent with his work and now has a new shop. If you want a quality cut check him out at flow barber.,positive
"A true artist in his craft. Precision and (Honestly overworked). Been going to him for the past 8 years. Hands down one of the finest barbers. Single edge blades, meticulous craftsmanship. You will never put on a hat once you get a haircut from him!",positive
Ally is incredible! I showed her a picture of the hair style and color I wanted and she nailed it! Will definitely be going to Ally from here on out!,positive
"Terrible! I looked better before I went here. Wasted my time and my money and my mom's time watching my kids while I splurged on getting my hair done once a year. Spent 5 hours as she screwed it up then tried to fix it and turned it a weird blue green color. I cried the whole long drive home to walk in the door and everyone look at me sideways. Ally did offer to fix it but I don't trust her touching my head not to mention the time and inconvenience to get a babysitter and all. No, I cut fried hair off myself and put box color on it to cover it. The blue-green still shows but it's not as obvious. I'll wait a month and die it again, I don't want to kill it. What a catastrophe!",negative
I love this salon!! And Sherry Fredell is the best hairstylist you could ever find!!!! I always leave with a smile on my face!!! The salon it's self is extremely clean and every staff member is very nice and professional,positive
"Absolutely love this salon! Excellent service and exceptional care! I go to Effie Nickols at this salon and I am always happy with the service and her excellent skills! Wonderful salon, wonderful service and it always results in wonderful hair! You should go see her!",positive
"This place used to be pretty good (indeed, my entire family went here) until a new owner took control recently. Since then, some of the better staff have left, stylists randomly cancel at the last minute, and the owner herself is not the easiest or most pleasant to deal with on the phone. Although my family had been going here for years, we moved to another salon. As well - parking is scare and a hassle here. When the salon used to be good, we put up with it. Once the salon went downhill and the owner/ stylists became indifferent - why bother?",negative
"Gaston did highlights on my hair. He always does an amazing job! On time, friendly, relaxed, and great. Will be coming back.",positive
"Gastón never seems to fail me! Love, love my new hair cut and style. Very easy to talk to and very easy accommodating and informative with your hair and products. I will forever be his client! Thx Gastón!",positive
Wonderful!The cut and style were magnificent! The experience and knowledge were above and beyond. Showed me how to truly care for my hair and style it to get the look I want. Thanks for helping me feel beautiful again.,positive
"I went to Gastón today after reading all the wonderful reviews and was not disappointed. I showed different pictures and we discussed what I liked about each haircut and how to adapt to my thick coarse hair texture. Gastón took the time before we started to make sure I was comfortable with our direction. I loved the cut, but what was more important to me was the ease I felt with Gastón cutting and styling my hair and that I thoroughly enjoyed myself today. I have already scheduled my follow-up appointment in 6 weeks. Thank you.",positive
I went in today for a consultation and ultimately stayed for a new haircut. My hair is very fine and was in need of some help. I found Gaston extremely honest and full of great knowledge and suggestions. I love my new hair style and will be going back for a color! Thank you!,positive
Gaston was wonderful! You can tell he knows how to cut hair and what looks good on you plus a lot of helpful tips with taking care of your hair. He was honest with me about my hair and I respect that. My hair was a mess trying to grow out a bad perm. In the end I think it surprised him on how well it turned out and I really like it! Plus every friend or family member have said they love it. I couldn't be more happy with my hair. Very happy customer!,positive
"No one in the Valley can create magic the way that Gaston does. I wanted to let my hair 'go natural' to bring back a healthy look but didn't want my roots to show in the process. He stopped coloring it and just with semi-permanent highlights and lowlights, I no longer have to worry about my roots showing. And my hair is healthy again. On top of it all, I look forward to my chats with him! He's charming and has a fab sense of humor.",positive
"I had my first appointment with Gaston today and it certainly will not be the last. I was so impressed with the level of customer service and quality service I received today. I loved the way Gaston gave his opinion on cut choices and coloring. You can tell he is extremely knowledgeable, has his finger on the pulse of the latest trends and is very passionate about what he does. This is the first time I have ever felt a true artist has worked on my hair. I have already booked my next appointment and suggest you do the same!",positive
"If you are looking for a good hairstylist who can do the perfect job for your request of beautiful color and also teaching you how to take care of new color at the same time, here is the right place you should go for. I love my new green color and I have follow his instructions to take care my new color. Now already more than 2 weeks after I have my lovely green hair, and the color is still looks the same as the day when I just got it.",positive
"Just moved from out of state, and found Gaston on yelp after a search of a specific line I have been using on my fashion color hair he was listed as carrying it. He was able to get me in for an appointment within that week at a convenient time that worked for me. When I got there before he started he took the time to get to know me, my hair history and things I liked and didn't like so that he could get me exactly was I was looking for. He also went over the products I need and things to stay away from due to the fashion color and it tending to wash out fast- but really making sure I understood for when I bought them from a store, so I didn't feel pressured to just buy what he had in his salon. (Although he does offer lots of great products also). So the aspect of him not pushing them on me was pleasantly different from previous experiences at other salons. To top it off- his prices were fantastic- and his experience and knowledge made the difference with me for sure. You can tell he absolutely loves what he does and is very passionate. I have never had so many compliments on my hair as I have since my hair was done with Gaston. I recommend him to everyone I meet!",positive
"Gastón is the stylist I've been searching for since I left San Francisco last year. The West Valley is a sea of Supercuts and trimmers, and I feared I'd never be able to find a stylist that worked on men's hair at this level of professionalism and quality. I gave Gastón a vague idea of what I wanted to do with my hair, and within minutes we were able to nail down a plan for growth and styling for the next 6 months. And he nailed the cut. I haven't looked this good in over a year. Now *that's* what I'm talking about.",positive
He is amazing! I have naturally curly hair so my color lifts a bit differently since it tends to be so dry. I have been to many hair stylists trying to find someone who can do my hair. Gaston is an hour away from me but worth the drive!!! I 100% recommend him!,positive
"I came to see Gaston after reading such wonderful things about him! I am thrilled with his fresh salon, his excellent customer service, his comfortable comprehensive lengthy color consultation and I am excited to see what fun things he has planned for my hair! I look forward to a new relationship with this awesome artist!!",positive
"I am editing this review because apparently Yelp didn't push through a response to me until a little while ago. I see the response was sent soon after I sent in my request but I didn't have anything in my messages until about 30 minutes ago so I've kicked up my review to 4 stars and will edit more after making an appointment cheers and I am excited since all the reviews are such raves. It said response time within an hour, for requesting an appointment, it's been well over an hour. Pushing 2 and nothing. Quite disappointing considering the rave reviews. I guess it can no longer say 100% response. I even double checked the hours of operation on Yelp. I'd understand if they said closed today but it states they are open. Ah well the hunt continues.",positive
"Took my daughter to get her hair dyed and cut, he did an amazing job better than what we expected. Not only did he do a great job but gave us advice on how to maintain and care for her hair. He is amazing and a true professional, and I highly recommend him",positive
"I just left and had to leave a review! This was by far the most amazing hair experience I have yet to have! He was very nice and attentive, and he helped me better understand my hair type. He also informed me on how to care for my hair which most hairstylists don't do. He took the time and was a doll! I will definitely be returning!",positive
"I have been enhancing my color for over 20 years. As an active-duty military member it's very hard to get somebody that understands your wants along with making you look beautiful. He is Very talented with the red color. Gaston was an amazing experience. Also, he took a good amount of time consulting with me and made sure that I understood the process and that I felt comfortable with what he was going to do. His products not only smell amazing but feel amazing. I know I'm in good hands now. I have found my stylist.",positive
"Congratulations on finding this review. Gaston is a quintessential hair expert. The man is a haircut, style and color virtuoso. If you landed here, look no further. You found a GEM. Managing hair color, with so much grey coming into the front only, is no easy undertaking. I had my hair bleached from black, at another salon. But, I was only half way there. My hair was four colors when I walked in! He listened to me, sat down and combed through pictures I brought in, and then spent FIVE HOURS correcting the color of my hair. He took my hair past the home plate!! Its a BEAUTIFUL strawberry blonde!!!!!!!! I won't go to another stylist after finding this needle in a hay stack. Enjoy the personalized attention you'll get from Gaston in his own Sola salon. No traffic. No listening to other people's drama. Just you, Gaston, and your imagination. He'll bring your vision to life. Thank you Yelp and thank you Gaston!!!",positive
"I have always gone to the same person to do my hair for over 10 years, but she is in Minnesota and I couldn't keep up going back there. So I decided to see gaston since he had great reviews. Well they were so spot on!! He was so fantastic and knew exactly what I needed. I definitely found my new hairstylist because I'll be going back!! Thank you!",positive
Thank you so much for the excellent haircut and style. Wow!! Gaston is as good of a listener as he is informative. He took the time to transform my hair to even better than I wished for. Gaston was also sensitive and flexible to my medical issues. Superb!,positive
Janair is amazing! I am so glad I have finally found her after trying many hairstylists in the valley. She listens and delivers the exact look as explained. She is great at what she does! Highly recommend,positive
"Let me just say I have been here in Scottsdale for a little over a year, and this is by far one the best experiences I've had. Janair really has her clients best interest at heart.",positive
I think I found my new hair stylist in Scottsdale! Janair is amazing. Thank you for fitting me in with such short notice.,positive
"I went almost 2 years looking a mess after moving to Scottsdale from the east coast (stylist trust issues) I found Janair through Yelp all great reviews so I reached out... a few texts and a phone call and I knew she was the one for me :) She offered to fit me in the next day! She was welcoming and at the end, I looked and felt like myself again. I won't be going anywhere else as long as I live in Scottsdale",positive
Absolutely love coming to Janair for my beautiful beach blonde highlights! She does an amazing job every time and I love coming here.,positive
"I moved to Phoenix about a year ago(nov. 2016) and found Janair shortly after, via a friend's recommendation. I'm very OCD when it comes to my hair, however, Janair took time to consult on my hair prior to styling and does a great job. She continues to exceed my expectations. I trust her with all my hair needs. Whether it is a wash and style, extensions/fill-ins, cuts, blowouts or color. She is professional, talented and punctual. I Highly recommend this salon.",positive
"I had a lot of hair cuts in my day, and let me tell you, Janair at Glitter N Bliss provided the best experience I've ever had! It's a cute, stylish, and clean salon in a very convenient N. Scottsdale location. After I had a horrible experience from a previous hair salon, I was struggling to find a good place I can trust. I came across Glitter N Bliss through Yelp and after reading all good reviews I thought I'd give it a try. I'm glad I did! Janair got me in the same day, she colored, cut and styled my hair and I absolutely love it! Hands down the best!! Janair has spent years perfecting her craft and it shows. If you are on the hunt for a hair stylist, go to Glitter N Bliss and it will be the best decision of your life!!",positive
"FABULOUS...........that is Janair. She definitely knows hair for health, a cut, or color, she is well versed. And, she listens to what you want and helps with her expertise input. She does a super great job, as I've been to many stylist, and she got my cut and color right the very first time working with me. She is also fun to interact with and very very reasonably priced! I'm so glad I found Janair and would recommend her to anyone!!!!!",positive
"Janair has blessed my hair for the past 3yrs. We've done color, cuts, braids, dreads, etc. I trust her with my life LOL great stylist!! We both have the same vision and always makes me feel comfortable. Even though I've moved out of state, every time I come back, she's my first stop!",positive
"Janair is the definition of fabulous. She listens, and actually takes the time to get it right. When I'm in her chair I never have to worry about the end result. My hair is straight and fine, very susceptible to heat and humidity levels. Most stylists breeze through with a quick cut and send me on my way. Janair makes sure that my cut frames my face and works well with my hair type. She is a top-notch stylist, not to mention she is always ready to greet with a smile. Love this girl!",positive
"Janair is absolutely wonderful. She has a great eye for how to accentuate your face and personality with awesome cuts and color. She has done my hair from long and brown, to crazy reds, to chopping it all off for donation and now I rock my pixie cut with style. She has great pricing and is very flexible to work with, I am very grateful I found her!",positive
"I have been living in Phoenix for three years and could never find anyone to cut my hair until now! Janair did such an amazing job on my out of control hair. She is also great to talk to while you're getting your hair done, time flies by. Unlike regular salons, Janair really cares about making sure that your hair cut is something that you love, even if it takes extra time to do. I walked out of their feeling like I was ready for my Vidal Sassoon commercial.",positive
"Janair was fabulous! I went in for a hair cut and got so much more. She gave me a head massage, washed my hair, used a deep conditioner, cut it, blew it dry and even put a few curls in it after. Typically when I ask the stylist to keep my hair long they don't listen, but she removed the dead ends and left me with my length. 100% recommend Janair!",positive
"Long long wait, probably worth paying extra to make an apt. Very cute place, very busy. Had to do some adjustments to my son's hair cut but overall got what we wanted.",positive
A great place to get a cut. If you are in need of a cut this is the place to go. I know when I come into Vegas I will be coming here. Might even come just for this place.,positive
My boyfriend is so picky but Bryce did AMAZING! He said this was the best haircut he's ever had. Combovers can be messed up so easily and he took his time and did an outstanding job!,positive
Take my 15yr old son here to see Chops. Always friendly and he does a great job. Awesome decor. My son refuses to have anyone else touch his hair.,positive
"Wait wasn't long, it depends on the time of day. Barber took his time came out with a great cut. Forgot the barbers name just know he had a face tattoo.",positive
"I loved how Rob cut my hair last time I was here so I I came back. Sadly Rob was not there but I figure ""they have good review the other guys must be as good at Rob"" so I stayed. I wrote my name on the list and waited, and waited, and waited. I kept seen two barbers just playing with their phones (I get that they were probably on their breaks) but I don't know that because no one even talk to me. the only interaction was when one of them ask me is I was a walk in. I'm a patient person if they had taken the time to tell me that i was going to have to wait because they need to take a break i would have understood and waited even longer. The lack of costumer service was off putting so I left.",negative
"Bryce is one talented barber! Cleanest fade ever. Fun True barbershop, funny conversation, friendly staff, and just a cool overall atmospheres",positive
"Best barber shop in town, hands down. Phenomenal skills, good prices, convenient scheduling, and a really, really good sound track. Chop cuts my hair, and he will be as long as he's in the business.",positive
"Moy was reccommended by my little brother a few years ago.. i was a bit iffy at first because he was at a barbershop school & you know, just learning. after my baby got off that chair, i knew i found my kids' barber for lifeeee. after he graduated he ventured off and you better bet your ass i made sure i followed him. he's wonderful at what he does and does it with great precision. ask for Moy & thank me later.",positive
"I went to check out this barbershop. This place was welcoming it had a good feeling, when you walk in its's not a hostile environment like some of these shops where you go and the barbers look like they have a stick up there asses. The guy who shaved me was quick but well done. I would definitely recommend this place.",positive
"I'd spent four weeks growing out a hobo beard and needed to get it under control. I made an appointment with Bryce and explained what I wanted and he knocked it out of the park. I've been to places where they consider what they do as an ""art"" and they couldn't hold a candle to him. Highly recommend.",positive
"Great cut. No same day appointments, so I just walked in. Got seated right away and got a great cut! This is no in/out barbershop. I was in the seat 30+ mins and they take their time to make it perfect... all the way down to the straight razor around the ears and neckline. $15 for active military! Will be back for sure in a few weeks.",positive
"I was in Vegas on a week-long vacation and realized my hair was in desperate need of a shave. Three of us walked in with no appointments - it took about 2.5 hours for all of us to be seen, but it was worth it in the end. Pros: Willing to take walk-ins Walked my partner through the hair cut AC was rolling Hair cuts all came out really well Cons: - We weren't given any time window, and to be honest, it wasn't made clear to me whether or not I'd get a cut. Two barbers were available almost immediately for my partner and brother, but the barber who sent them back said that they ""probably didn't have time for a third"". I sat there for about an hour waiting to figure out if I'd get a cut. - The barber who cut my brother's hair actually cut my brother's scalp while doing a hard line. Not cool. If in Vegas and in need of a cut, I'd probably go back.",positive
"been going to goodtimes every week for almost a earn now because Caleb has been cutting me for years & week in and week out he kills it. I'll hop in the chair & he knows exactly what i want every single time. You gotta love the vibes goodtimes gives off too, makes the overall experience that much better, whether it be the music choice of the day, the movies they play on the flat screens or just the talk in general. stop in you'll have a good time",positive
While vacationing in Vegas I decided to get a cut. So I googled away and came across Goodtimes Barbershop! This place is LEGIT AS F... well you know. Their whole crew there is awesome. Walk ins are welcome but make that appointment if you're going on the weekend and stick to it. Don't be a D-bag. Don't forget to tip cuz you're going to LOVE YOUR CUT!,positive
"Damn, where to begin. This is hands down the best shop in Vegas. First off their crew is extremely friendly and professional. They make you feel welcome right when you walk in the door. The shop is gorgeous, amazing art everywhere! Bryce especially kicks ass. I've been here a few times already and have no reason to ever go anywhere else to get my beard trimmed. Thanks a lot guys! I'll be sending everyone your way!",positive
"I just moved back to town a few weeks ago and was looking for a new barber, read some reviews on this shop and couldn't pass it up. Made an appointment with Caleb and the dude absolutely is a seasoned vet on the clippers. Gave him a quick rundown on what I was looking for and he went beyond expectations, best cut I've had in ages. If you have a beard, Caleb will have it on point before you leave. Def gonna be an every 2 week customer!",positive
"Okay, honestly... First time growing beard and wanted to get lined up to where beard still is growing but edges are clean. How is that hard to understand? I decided to get haircut as well just because I wanted to be uniform with the edges... I explain to him one side of face grows thicker and faster than other side and wanted to make look even. So he trims down my whole beard. Does a little shaving cream twice around whole face, wraps me up in hot towel, then more shaving cream. Touches three spots fast with shaver, puts more substance on, rewraps me up in towel. Cleans off n hands me mirror. Mustache crooked, one side of goat tee is thick, one side thin. One side of chin was high one was low. Smh... Asked for him to make even n he tells me I have a bald spot... So I replied then bring other side down to make even... Told him cool when he hands me mirror, I just wanted to get the hell outta there. Had me sitting in a chair one step from bathroom. Neck on fire, he tells me $40!!!! Felt bad somehow for him and even gave him $45... Walked out feeling ashamed and ripped off. Won't go back.",negative
"No good times here, just a rip off by some clowns that pose as barbers and they were empty when I walked in. They quote me price of $40 on phone 15 minutes ago for haircut and shave, I go there and magically the price increased 25% to $50 in 15 minutes. That's absurd inflation, or a simple bait and switch. I'm not buying drugs in a prison or à used car, just want what I was promised over phone, a haircut and shave for $40. I guess you have to struggle to find a decent and honest barber in this desert when it's over 100 degrees. Never had this happen before. Avoid, shady, no ethics or morals, dishonest scam artists that lie. Their hair cutting ability is as incompetent as their pricing and scam bait and switch techniques. Go somewhere honest, not this place. It's gross & staff is incompetent, raised in a barn with no manners & more importantly trying to rob you aka dishonest. It's simply rude & inconsiderate to waste someone's time and do classic bait & switch lying. Get your act together.",negative
I drove by a few times and was immediately attracted by the old school look that this place had. The barbers are true professionals and greet and treat their customers w a lot of dignity and respect! Impeccable fades and solid service.,positive
My brother in law wanted a clean shave and for the his groomsmen to look good before the wedding. I was tasked with finding a barbershop while in Vegas. I found Goodtimes while searching through Yelp. I called 2 weeks ahead of time to set up an appointment for 8 guys. It turned out to only be 5 that showed up. However when I got there we had to wait like we didn't have appointments. I was a little upset but their work speaks for itself. All of the guys except me have never been to a barbershop before and they all walked out telling me how happy they were with the job Goodtimes did and that they now need to start going to barbershops. The overall experience was great but I think they need to work on their book keeping when it comes to appointments.,positive
"Third appointment at good times barber shop, Enzio did a great job on the beard and hair cut. The only barber shop I will ever go to!",positive
"I went to many barbers around the city before, the guys here are very professional, the place is great, and the best costumer service I ever had in a barbershop,from all of them, if you are in vegas check it out, thanks the great job",positive
"I have a girl who cuts my hair and keeps it up well but her beard game is pretty crap. So I decided even though its a trip I gotta try this shop because the pics are amazing, price is good, and they carry some great pomades. I managed to get a same day appointment with Caleb. Holy balls my beard looks better than I even thought it could. It's perfectly shaped and cleaned up, the shop was clean and smelled great, and Caleb's beard game is strong. I'll be back like the damn terminator.",positive
"Was on vacation from San Jose and needed a good cut. I noticed Goodtimes on yelp and gave them a call at 9:30am hoping they could get me in for an appt. They were able to get me an appt at 11:00am with Caleb. Took an uber from the strip and right when I walked in I noticed the classic feel of the shop with the sailor jerry bottles on the wall lol. Coming from San Jose and the amount of great barbershops they have, Caleb barber skills were on point!! Great with the razor and a professional with the scissors. Took his time and told me the reason he cut my hair a certain way. I HIGHLY recommend anyone from out of town to head to goodtimes barbershop.",positive
Great barbershop!! when I moved out from LA I was unsure if i can find a new barber. But Chops does not disappoint when it comes to a clean cut. Been following them for a while and this new location is perfect!! We'll be back always for sure!,positive
I'm new to the whole Beard thing and I heard great things about this place from Mike Minor so I had to check it out.... Caleb was my Barber and I couldn't have been happier. Caleb is great and I recomend him and Good Times as your go to Barber Shop. Beyond Clean Super Nice Staff. I did a walk in and was lucky this place is a Jewel and an Appointment would be recommended.,positive
"Chops is my barber and I can honestly say he's the best in town!!! I take my father every 2 weeks to see chops as he can not drive himself and it is the highlight of his 2 weeks forsure. There is no better place in town to get a cut. Chops, Moy, Chris, Allan and Caleb thank you so much!!!",positive
"I decided to try this place and it was a great decision. I love that old fashion and modern barbershop really cool. My barber was Caleb, he did a great job on my comb over best one I had. Cool chilled guy. Need a good place for a cut this place is it!",positive
"Just had my hair cut and beard trimmed by Chops. I won't be going anywhere else!!! Such a nice guy!! It was more like a conversation with a friend, with a few interruptions about my hair, than a haircut. Then I got the hot towel treatment, I love the hot towels! I missed the shave though. It must have happened because my neck and cheeks are trimmed perfectly. I just never felt the razor!! Not only do I look like a million, I feel like a million!",positive
"This is a very old review and long overdue. Hopefully things have changed. Not only did I get a terrible haircut with grossly uneven sides, etc, but I explicitly asked for a ""men's"" haircut. The same tools were used, the same style of cut was given, but they charged the ""women's"" rate. In many places in North America, such as NYC, this is illegal. Not only because it's overcharging, but because it's discriminatory on the basis of gender. Simply because they thought I looked like a woman, regardless of my gender identity or the service performed, I was charged more. Human rights council of Ontario would have pursued this, FYI Grateful Head. Hopefully you've chosen a more progressive pricing structure, not to mention more worthwhile stylists.",negative
"This was my first time at the grateful head, after a few different friends had recommended the salon to me. I have to say I was very impressed! I didn't have an appointment but had time to kill and decided to see if they had room for a cut. I was taken to a chair right away, and my stylist's name was Katie. She took her time and listened to what I wanted, yet wasn't afraid to give her own input, which I really appreciate in a stylist. She cleaned up my bob beautifully, which I like blunt with some very slight layering in the back. I am extremely happy with her work and will definitely be returning. My only reason for not giving the full 5 stars is that it is quite expensive. The decor and ambiance is great and my coffee was hot and strong! Definitely recommend.",positive
Nice place I really dig the decor and all around ambiance of the place. I booked with Matthew for colour and trim and happy with the results. He got rite to work extremely time efficient and nice job overall. Rates were decent also. I will definitely be back!,positive
Had an amazing cut and pin-up style from Dana! Will absolutely be going back to see her! It's obvious that Dana has exceptional skills and experience. The staff is really nice and the salon has a great vibe and great music. Just make sure to get to the area early as finding parking can be tricky! Thanks x,positive
"Great salon! This was my first time at Grateful Head and I left very happy, my hair looked beautiful. I had a cut with Earl, and colour with Dana. Lysa was very helpful and answered all my questions via email, prior to the visit. What I was trying to achieve with my hair: last November I put a semi-permanent medium brown/auburn, it mostly washed out over the winter, but the stubborn copper stayed and it didn't suit my complexion at all. My natural colour is a dark golden blonde with an ash base. I really wanted my natural colour back, with a few higlights for a bit of brightness, without the damage, as I'm trying to grow out my hair a little longer. Dana really understood what I was looking for, and we did very natural 'sun-kissed' babylights and toner (few minutes at the sink). Dana was keeping an eye on the highlights as my hair is very fine, and also noticed that my colour lifted very quickly, which was awesome, so we didn't need to leave in it longer than necessary=no damage. The baby lights looked so nice that I decided to add on a tiny bit more a week later. It was perfect. And I'm glad we took it slowly as I wanted to make sure it was what I wanted. The cut that Earl did was stunning, he's amazing, it suits my face shape perfectly, and since I let my hair air dry, the cut works with that. I keep my hair mostly all the same length (for more volume), and with this cut, it looks even fuller and brings out the natural wave, which I love. I'm super happy I went to Grateful Head.",positive
"I have had my hair bleached a couple times, once before recently dying it mint. I originally wanted to get another bleach and do a light blonde with dyed roots, but the stylist Nicole discouraged belaching it for a third time (erring on the side of caution). She helped me find a good solution to my problem during the consultation- we decided to do an ombre (top half close to my natural colour) and simply tone the ends. She trimmed my ends and shaved down my undercut, and it ended up being much more inexpensive than I had anticipated. It looks great and I am really happy!",positive
"Perfection! Such a lovely and unique place, and they cut my curly hair beautifully each time. It was a great day when this salon opened on Roncesvalles, and the Dundas location is so beautiful in such a different way. Yes, it costs money, but it's worth it! Support this local business by checking them out (especially if you have curly hair: ask for Stacy!)",positive
"Not impressed. $270 later I barely got a trim and my requested colour process (balayage // sombre) turned out super red and brassy and nothing like I requested. In the stylists defence, he did offer to fix it but had just previously defended his work and argued with me that there was no red in my hair whatsoever. Went out on a limb to try a new place. Regret it.",negative
"Just had my hair cut by Paul Shepherd for the first time last week. I am impressed. All the odds were totally stacked against him: I have annoying hair (frizzy, wavy, with weird unruly curls in weird place); I am growing out a pixie cut; I am not very good at explaining what I want and I don't do high maintenance styling. He figured out what was bothering me and fixed it perfectly- giving me a haircut that works with my hair, my face, the shape of my head, my styling capabilities (i.e. zero). Highly recommended. (It's not a five because it is quite expensive, but, then again, good things do cost money)",positive
"While, people seem to be giving Stacy positive reviews, I did not see her. If I had, perhaps my review would be more positive. A young man cut my hair, and I don't remember his name. If I did, I probably wouldn't write it here because I'm not that mean. I'll just say that this place is highly overrated, OVERPRICED, and just a rip off. Also, the staff didn't know about new hair trends, and tried to make me feel stupid for requesting one. The person who washed my hair, gave me the WORST hair wash I have ever received in my life. The was no pressure added at all, and my hair felt dirty and flat afterwards. It was a huge disappointment because I normally look forward to getting my hair washed and getting a head massage. The cut I received was out-dated, unflattering, and uneven, and the stylist was just insecure. The atmosphere was kind of cool, and rock inspired, but nothing to rave about, and not a reason to come here. You should be coming here for a good haircut. I'm sorry, but for almost 100 $, for a simple hair cut, I deserve a great haircut and much better service. I do not recommend this place and will not be returning.",negative
"Best salon in the city hands down. The vibe is great, the staff are welcoming and the stylists are super talented. I've had my hair cut by Stacy Stray many times there and every time it looks perfect. Highly recommended!",positive
"Very prompt with appointments... I have NEVER waited for an appointment and I've been there over a dozen times. Cost for colour and cut is on par with similar salons elsewhere. I highly recommend Stacy Fitz. She is great girl to chat with who does a fantastic job cutting hair. Hope she never leaves! Let me just say that reception is a pain ... Phone tag is kind of the usual way I have to make an appointment. Despite that annoyance, reception is very friendly.",positive
"Called this salon this morning because I couldn't take my hair anymore and was given an appointment 45 mins later. I didn't want to spend a lot, so I asked for a junior stylist. Got there and met Nicole, and our consultation went great. Showed her some pinterest shots and she totally got it. 1 hour later, and after a very careful check, dry and straighten, Nicole was done and I was really very pleased. She got what I was after and gave me a great cut. I'd recommend Nicole to anyone - she's got talent! Thanks Nicole for a great cut!",positive
"I've gone to Grateful Head for almost two years now. I've seen many of the stylists there and I've always walked out with a great colour and cut. I have fine, curly hair. For years I only went to salons that focussed on curly hair, but I got very bored and I rarely ended up with anything interesting. Since Matthew started at GH a year ago, I've gone to him exclusively. He is a true professional. My colour always looks fabulous, and he manages to cut my hair EXACTLY how I want it. He's not afraid trying different things with my hair, but will also be honest if he thinks that something might not work out. I appreciate that. He's also a lot of fun and has a great sense of humour. Matthew also cut my 7 year old daughter's hair on her birthday and she was delighted with the results (no more Melonheads for her!). Highly recommended. I am always getting complimented on my hair.",positive
$50 for a junior stylist seems more than reasonable for a woman's cut. Margot gently coaxed me to cut of my colour damaged ends. She also provided me tips on styling that didn't involve an up-sell of a styling product. Thanks Margot.,positive
"The Good: For a place that looks like it's all about cool -- the distressed wallpaper, chandeliers, a certain amount of Gothic splendour -- the staff are very friendly, cheerful and helpful. Coffee or tea as soon as you sit down (and maybe a glass of wine if you've been there a few times) doesn't hurt. Generally, my haircuts have been great, and that's with a head of fairly unruly wavy hair. I've also brought my kids there and they love the stylists and have received great cuts. Great products too. The Slightly-Less Good: If you're a boy, make sure to ask for one of the stylists that likes working on men's hair. The one less-than-perfect cut I got was when I was pressed for time, couldn't get one of the great men's-hair stylists and took a flyer on someone else. My fault for bad time management more than theirs.",positive
"I'll get it out of the way right off the bat - you're going to cash out at Grateful Head. But when you are plied with wine, coffee, smiles, and get to hang out in a beautiful space with an all-around upbeat, warm, and professional vibe, all I can say is that you get what you pay for. I am a very sheepish salon-goer by nature--I get intimidated easily by frosty stylists and am terrible at articulating exactly what I want, but Stacey worked with my super thick hair and gave me a maintenance-free cropped cut that not only doesn't look like a mushroomy lampshade, but looks extremely youthful, fun, and chic. This is exactly the cut I wanted, but better, and I didn't have to climb a mountain to get my needs across. I came on a superior recommendation from a friend but was still expecting to part with my curtain of hair and leave in an extremely bad mood, feeling strange and used (I've been the victim of a few unsanctioned surprise 'experiments' at the hands of some overzealous stylists hell bent on making me look as unprofessional as possible). That was not the case. Stacey made great product recommendations and I even purchased an amazing finishing spray--something I'd never do. Maybe it was the wine? The Hank Williams tunes playing softly somewhere in the distance? The glittering smiles and tattooed bodies? I think I found my salon.",positive
"Cool ambience, awesome music, beautiful people... all they need to do now is learn how to cut hair and they will really be on to something. My experience: I called on a Monday to make a Tuesday appointment. I asked for a ""senior stylist"" as they have on their menu. The other choices being the ""creative stylist"" or ""new talent"". There is a $15 difference here, for men's cuts. I was told I'd get Katie, who had been working there for three years. Everyone was nice and friendly when I arrived and there is no doubt to the vibe of this place, there's an energy there. I asked for a trim on the sides and short on the top but enough to be able to play around and keep it messy. I was told my hair wasn't long enough to do that. I haven't had a haircut in nearly three months...! We settled on trimming the sides and just cleaning up the top. Using scissors only (as I requested) she managed to cut my hair on the side to almost the skin... on one side. The other side was trimmed actually not too bad save for the raised patches here and there. She barely touched the top so the end result was a very 90's looking hairstyle. When she showed me the back, my hairline at the bottom looked totally crooked so I figured it must be me seeing it wrong. She blow dried it and styled it a bit and in the lights and mirrors there, it looked okay. When I got home and showered, upon further investigation, there was no fade from the side of my head to the top, just clumps and indeed the bottom line at the back was on an angle. I basically had a crooked bad bowl cut. The part that really gets me is that this woman is 22 years old. How does that qualify her to be a senior stylist? I guess the ""new talent"" come in to see their clients during recess! They really have a lot of nerve charging the money they do for such inexperienced stylists who clearly have no idea what they are doing. I guess she earns that for dressing up like Betti Page? I ended up getting my hair fixed elsewhere for half the price, I didn't trust them enough to ever touch my ungrateful head ever again.",negative
"I tried this salon for the first time and was hoping that they would do a good job. The stylist I had was Stacy Stray. He kind of did a bad job at it and I have to say I won't be back here again. As for the service at reception...it was really messy and unattentive. It seemed like they were having an event or something at the salon and didn't have the patience for customers. At the same time, I had to wait over 20 mins for my appt, which I didn't aprpeciate at all. What is the point of having an appt if you have to wait 20 mins for it anyway? So, it was not a good experience overall and I wouldn't recommend the salon.",negative
"D'excellents coiffeurs et coiffeuses qui prennent le temps de bien de réussir votre coupe. Autrefois sur Dundas, près du parc Trinity-Bellwoods, ce salon a du déménager dans le quartier de Roncesvalles. Cela fait quelques kilomètres de plus pour certains clients, mais qu'importe, la qualité du service fait qu'on y retourne régulièrement.",positive
This place butchered my hair. I have not worn in down in the month it's been since getting my hair done. They butchered a friend of mine's hair as well. They were fast and friendly but perhaps at the expense of quality. Buyer beware.,negative
"Toronto's best named salon has moved! I had an appointment to see my favourite stylist at Grateful Dead's new location in the Roncesvalles Village. The size of the new salon is about the same as their former one with a few decor differences. The owner did a wonderful job creating a comfortable and beautiful space - check out the velvet skull heads wallpaper on the back wall! So cute! Apart from that, it's the same nice staff going, great work; now in a great neighbourhood!",positive
"I've been going to Grateful Head for about two years now. I love the salon vibe without the attitude. I've always been happy with my cut and colour, and I've gone from platinum blonde flat ironing, back to my natural dark brunette and curls. I love that there's new artwork on the walls each time I visit, they have a great selection of magazines to peruse while your colour is setting, they have stylists that know how to give great curly cuts, that sometimes the owner will surprise you with a complimentary glass of wine, and to top all that off I have discovered many new favourite bands from their playlist!",positive
"I have been to grateful head a few times ( I am under a pseudo name here). I will not be returning. the first time I was very happy with my haircut. the second time I wasn't thrilled . I thought I wouldn't go back but then I thought well, we all have bad days.; So I returned. I HATED my cut. I will not return. I will not recommend the place. I wonder if maybe my stylist only knows one type of cut and basically gives you the same. If you do decide to go there, then I suggest you tell them up front you want to finish with a straight blow dry. I have been meek about insisting on that and i paid for it. Perhaps if they know they cant hide the cut behind curls they will give it a good cut. My hair is still not long enough to fix so I will have to wait a few more weeks. I can tell you, it wont be back to Grateful Head. .. my head was anything but Grateful.",negative
"This is my alternative Great Clips location when for whatever reason (too long a wait, etc.) I don't shuffle on over to my preferred hairstylists at 3073 W. Craig Road. It's in the same shopping plaza at Craig & Decatur as an Albertsons supermarket at which I frequently shop. It's always best to check in online (an extremely convenient feature which also specifies your estimated wait time!) and avoid the hassle of a possibly extremely long wait when arriving unannounced. I have very rarely had to wait very long when doing so and am usually quite expeditiously processed and once again on my merry way in 30 minutes or less. The fact that the hairstylists at all Great Clips document your current haircut preferences/requirements for easy reference during your future return visits helps speed things along. Great Clips haircut coupons make an appearance several times each year in the Las Vegas Review Journal and the wise among us will use them properly and save as much as about $5.00 to $6.00 off the going rate of $13.00 per haircut ($7.99 coupon currently available in the newspaper). The overall quality of the haircut itself and service provided is quite good: I have personally never been disappointed, always a happy camper.",positive
"I would rate this place a zero if I could. I'm glad I didn't stay to get a haircut. I checked in online with 0 wait time. (0 wait time should have raised a red flag...Go figure) I went in with my sons and my aunt to get haircuts before Christmas. I walked in and 2 employees where sitting and didn't acknowledge us. After a couple of minutes, one of them asked if I had checked in online. I said ""yes, that's my name on the screen."" I hadn't registered the other names, so as I spelled the other names out for her, she kept telling me to wait, and then she would say ""go ahead,"" and as I started spelling it out for her again, she would tell me to wait. She attempted to spell my son's name and she spelled it incorrectly. I told her what the last person's name was and I began spelling it for her and with the worst attitude, she said, ""I know how to spell."" By that time I had enough of her attitude and my wife asked if I wanted to leave and I replied, ""yes."" I went down the street to a different Great Clips and it was an absolutely better experience. As soon as we walked in, they greeted me & checked me in. They were way busier than the other location. It was a good thirty minute wait, but well worth it! Go there instead by the Winco on Decatur.",negative
"I've been going here for years. They do a great job, they're super friendly and quick! I recommend downloading the app and checking in online. I hate waiting.",positive
donna cannot competently cut any specific hairstyle according to your expectations. no wonder there's no wait time at this location because there is zero repeat customers. i highly do not recommend this establishment and will steer everyone i can away from having a disappointing experience here.,negative
"My son went in asking for a scissor cut on top and taper down. First thing, got the clippers and cut the front hairline higher than I could ever imagine. He is not happy and every person who sees him asks who messed up his hair. Because I am human and realize people make mistakes and the world is not perfect, I called to see if I could get a refund or a discount on a future cut with our old stylist....still willing to go back, considering we have went there for about two years with no problems, was promised a call back and still NO call back to date. Sucks!! I have four boys who go there, we live around the corner uuurrrggg",negative
Let me start by saying I'm very particular about my hair but don't want to spend an hour for a haircut. My friend Brandon said they have great staff and know what you want with a couple questions. He was right. The work speaks for itself. Try it out,positive
"Just got a haircut from here, showed a picture of Jensen Ackles as a reference for my hairstyle, my stylist was extremely rude and purposefully cut the top of my hair using a size 1 clipper (which is basically bald) because she was impatient with the fact that I was being picky about how I wanted my haircut. At no point in time was I rude, so this isn't a spite induced attack at the store, the store manager even agreed with me. But in all honesty I'm extremely infuriated because it seemed like the stylist (some Philipina woman) was out to spite ME for being picky like I dont have the right to be about my own hair. Xis is my usual stylist and does a fantastic job you should definitely go to this location for his quality haircuts and the others, but that one particular stylist should never be apart of anything customer service related whatsoever due to her impatience, lack for empathy, and unaccountabilty of her actions. Now I'll have to wait a good month or two before even considering to style my hair the way I want it. Thanks Great Clips",negative
"Chae... I pray I'm spelling her name correctly... is absolutely precious. I've seen her twice and both times great haircuts. And to top it off she's extremely friendly, beautiful smile, and nice conversationalist. I called the manager that day to tell him about her quality and he said he'd pass along the compliments. I am hoping he did. Thank you.",positive
"I have gone there about 6 times over the past couple of years, usually good. I went the other day & I should of known better when the person cutting my hair was wearing sunglasses. One side was longer than the other side, didn't trim my sideburns. Very bad haircut.",negative
"First time clients must register so they can look you up in their system by your phone number. I'm from California so men's haircut is only $8 & it's a top notch barber shop, can't beat the price. The prices in Vegas is ridiculous. I figured I'll give this place a try for $13. I asked for a ""skin high fade"" (straight fade) & I came out looking SHREK. She gave me a high pineapple fade. I didn't want to complain and make it worse, I don't plan on coming back. Very disappointed. Would not recommend this place.",negative
"The staff, & management were great, especially Janie! She was so helpful, friendly & was wonderful! I would highly recommend this location!",positive
Great and Fast service by Sonia! Directly what I wanted and got in an out quickly... great for people who know what they want and are on a busy schedule,positive
"I always go to this location and the hair stylists, specially Dina are all great! There are a lot of Great Clips around, but this location tops the list.",positive
"I just got my haircut today by Dina at the lakes location and I just have to say what an amazing job she did I absolutely love it!!!!!!!! I will definitely be back next time I need a haircut. I recommend everyone to come in and ask for Dina, you wint be disappointed.",positive
Great place to get a hair cut very clean and very nice! Jessica was excellent and very helpful she did everything she could to keep my daughter calm she did exactly what i asked for! Please ask for her shes excellent,positive
Jainey helped us! She was so good! She had good customer service and was so professional!! Hands down will come back for her!,positive
"Great service, the stylist are good and nice to be with, my hair looks great, cant wait to come back again, nice job to be here",positive
"Both my boys got haircuts here. Specific to my instructions, they got their perfect do's. :). The hairdressers are very accommodating. Wait time is reasonable unlike other great clips. Definitely will be back.",positive
"Online check in with a 5-minute wait time. Checked it at 1 minute wait. Sat for 20 minutes, several others came in, checked in and went through, they were online check-ins so I figured they did so before me. One stylist a bit too chatty and upselling with a finished customer for a solid amount of time, going off topic a bit. At about 40 minutes of waiting a walk-in gets checked in and walked right to a chair, asked whats going on with the queue, looks like she deleted me when I confirmed my check in initially. She game a half-hearted apology of 'something wrong in the system' trying to shake blame off herself and go back to her chair. Would have been okay if she was genuine about her mistake. Couldn't get myself to support this location, won't be back.",negative
"Sonia is excellent twice she's given me a great cut the way I wanted. The haircut was a high fade zero all the way up on the top. Before I got my haircut done another way but now I always get it done this style thanks to their keen eye and suggestions from other stylists. Thanks again Sonia for being clean, courteous, and polite!",positive
"What a disappointment! The Asian woman with a buzz cut (jojo?) did exactly the opposite of what I wanted. Even after repeatedly requesting my instruction. She even actively disagree with me. I have to go to another shop to fix it. It only cost 13 bucks, so I guess you get what you pay for",negative
Very friendly staff at this location. I went with my fiance mom and she used the app to check in. As soon as we got there we were seen. Immediately washed and taken care of. If you need a quick and easy service you should definitely stop in here.,positive
"First off... Let me preface this with the fact that I am well aware that I have thick hair and on this particular visit it was super long. So my boyfriend frequents this Great clips because it's closest to our home. He only goes there when this particular hair dresser is on duty because she's ""great"". I decide I need a hair cut and stop by Great Clips hoping that ""great"" hairdresser is available. I walk in, she's in and there aren't many people waiting. GOOD. I check in and wait. I should say that while waiting 2 people complain about another hairdresser on duty. The culture is very quick clip and go. Still. I wait. Finally my turn. She greets me and I sit but I warn her about my length and I make her fully aware that I wanted to chop a good amount off. No biggie, right? She begins by almost discouraging me about the amount I wanted to cut. Asking me ""Are you sure?"" at least 4 times. Whatever. I'm already on the chair. She starts to brush through my hair and my head was snapping back so hard and I was clearly in discomfort but she keeps brushing through until I ask her if I can brush through my own hair. Not once did she apologize or seem to acknowledge the discomfort. As she begins to measure out the length and confirm with me I ask her if it was possible to make a first cut long enough and then we can go from there if I wanted to go shorter. She claimed that she couldn't do that because then she'd have to charge me two haircuts. OK?!... We go back and forth and I settle with ""bra strap"" length. I figured that's long enough to get used to shorter hair than what I've had for 5 years now. She starts chopping off and I remind her that I didn't want a blunt straight cut and she says ""then how do you want it?"" At this point I'm ready to get out of the chair except she's already chopped off half of the hair. I asked her to do what they call a ""notch cut"" which makes the hair look more choppy than straight cut. As she's cutting my hair, they get a new customer and another hair dresser checks them in and I can hear the customer being told that the wait would be 15 minutes. My hairdresser butts in and says ""more like 30, I've got a lot of hair here"" not in a joking way, not in a light hearted way but in a tone of annoyance. Anyway. She basically finishes my haircut and shows me the mirror and my hair is shoulder length!!!! SHOULDER LENGTH!!!!! Not mid back... Not ""bra strap"" length, as she called it"" but SHOULDER LENGTH!!!!! What am I supposed to say ""it's too short!! Glue it all back on"" I paid, tipped and left. The only reason why I tipped was because it was a lot of hair to cut. So here is my recommendation. 1. DO come here if you're a guy. They've got the quick, clip and go thing down. 2. DO check in online. Everyone that walked in and had not checked in online ended up waiting upwards of 30 minutes. 3. DO NOT come here if you are looking for customer service and a friendly experience. 4. DO NOT come here if you want anything other than a trim and buzz cut ( duh. I know. But I've been to the great clips on rainbow and they've styled my hair better than a $90 hairdresser would. all in all. I learned my lesson. Never again.",negative
"$9 dollar men's #1 guard medium fade haircut. I got the deal from the Yelp app. Originally a $12 haircut, so not a bad deal. The haircut was good, it's a men's #1 fade, so it's pretty easy. It only took about 10-15 mins for the haircut and turned out pretty decent. I will be back to location again, thanks!",positive
"Gave this place a second try after a horrible experience the first time. Shouldn't have. Paid 16$ for a shampoo & trim. The whole process took less than 10 minutes (RED FLAG) and the stylist sent me out into the cold with wet hair after blow drying for less than a minute. She was extremely rushed even though there was only 1 customer waiting and 4 stylists working. On top of that, the uneven cut I went to get fixed was still uneven after I had left and fixed my hair up myself. I will be trying a different Great Clips location after this disaster.",negative
"Just walked in tonight, it wasn't busy at all which was good. Thought I can use their thingy right here on yelp but the guy working there told me they don't use those anymore so okay. Haircut is just $13 plus if you want shampoo, it's gonna be $3 more. It wasn't pricey at all. The lady who cut my hair was really nice, she asked me some questions and really listened to all the things that I had to say. She suggested me this and that too. Over all, she made a great job on my hair. I really liked it!",positive
They had me walking out with a mullet. I had to finish layering my hair myself. And they were rude with dirty look. I'll stick to my sw durango location,negative
"Incredibly rude employees who shouldn't be allowed to work in customer service positions. I heard them arguing over which one ""had"" to take my special needs family member. If I knew it wouldn't absolutely ruin his self esteem I would have called the ignorant workers out on their blatant discrimination. I will be contacting the corporate office about this awful treatment. I'm absolutely appalled by this behavior.",negative
If you are looking for a professional style cut but at an amazing price you must come to this great clips and let Melody do her work! She always does a phenomenal cut and will have you out the door on your way in minutes.,positive
Melody is great! I live in Anthem and travel across town just to get my hair cut from her. She is very friendly and is always available when I need her services;) She really take her time to make sure you are satisfied. I highly recommend her and her services.,positive
"I am seriously warning everyone to please stay away from this place. Rude workers. Took my 4 year old here to just get a bang trim. I said ""just trim her bangs so it's not in her eyes"" my daughter goes with her stylist (a blonde Mexican woman) and yes comes back with her bangs trimmed plus more!!! She added so much more bangs! Plus cut off all her side bangs!! She seriously had side burns! I said ""what did you do!!!! I only wanted a bang trim! Why is her side bangs gone?"" She said that's how it supposed to be and that will still be $5! They didn't do at all what I asked. Now my daughter's hair looks terrible till the sides grow out. I can't even tie her hair up! It's been a month since her cut, and so far about 20+ people asked me why on earth I cut her side burns, I have to explain to them that that was not me, that was greatclips! Don't go here.",negative
Had my haircut there the other day and came close to walking out. The stylist name was Melody. She's more interested in talking about herself .the haircut that you gave me I had to check myself and it was longer own one side. Not good,negative
"Wait time too long. I went in one day & was informed of a 50 minute wait time, it wouldn't have been too bad if one of the stylists hadn't serviced one of her friends(who was not on the list) before me. Also, it seems like they don't have any management since some of the ""ladies"" working there dress as if they were working in a brothel.",negative
"My husband comes here all the time but this was my 1st time. I've officially popped my great clips cherry. It did not disappoint. Spoke with Barbara on the phone, asked if there was a wait.. Then remembered that you can sign in and make an ""apt"" online so I did. As i got there I saw there were 5 people waiting, then i remembered DAH DAAA, i was 1st cause i signed in online. Going straight to the front and getting a seat.. oh yeah biotches! Of course i got loads of dirty looks but hey, maybe they should have been smart and checked in online, mwahaha! (my evil voice). My hair cutter was Barbara. A nice looking older lady. She was super friendly, we did a lot of talking a talking about my 6 month old that was in the front with my husband. I really liked that she asked what i wanted and was very percise. I'm always afraid to go to someone knew and especially since people say they'll cut an inch and then they cut 4 inches [had that happen to be once upon a time]. She followed my directions to a tee and i left a very happy girl. I shall be back. Love that its cheap, only 12 dollars [even cheaper if you bring your receipt next time which gives you 2 bucks off] For customer service that shines, hair that comes out perfect, and a no wait this is the place to be.",positive
I come here about every 2 weeks and well I can't complain. The prices are not to bad. If you are not 10 years of age or under and or 65 years of age and over then you will pay 12 dollars. If you do fall into those age groups then it is only going to be 10 dollars for you. The customer service is great and well sometimes it is very busy and other times well your in and out no wait but that is probably like any haircut place I presume. They put what you do to your hair in the computer so they know exactly what you want when you check in. Great place if you want a cheap and good haircut.,positive
"2 items, one for me and one for my mom. I get a very simple cut, one length, slightly undercut. That's it. Got a cut by Sarah on 5/5/18 and after I went home, washed and waited for it to dry (I don't blow dry, per Sarah my hair doesn't blow dry correctly because I cut it at one length. Yeah right!) and noticed that one side was significantly longer than the other side (at least 1""). I went in to have her fix it (hey, things happen, right). She actually was arguing with me about whether it was uneven or not, pulling some strands from the very front to the center of my chin as empirical proof of this. I pointed out the uneven portion was behind my ear so that test wouldn't work. I told her to look that one side is touching the top of the shoulder and the other is about 1 inch above the shoulder. THAT is proof of the unevenness of the cut. She finally agreed to fix it and started. Didn't take very long. Then she started to cut the short side shorter I had to stop her. Finally leaving with a so-so cut and a bad feeling overall. On 5/8/18 I called to an appointment on 5/12/18 for my mom to get a cut and perm from Gloria at the shop. I was told ""let me check with Gloria when she comes in at 9 and if the appointment is ok with her you WON'T hear back from us."" I didn't hear back so on the 12th I got mom (who is physically handicapped and on oxygen 24/7) and loaded her into the car and arrived for the appointment at about 10 till our time. I was told that Gloria knew absolutely nothing about our appointment even though is was clearly written in the book (which the shop admitted). Gloria had 2 other's ahead of mom (walk ins who should have been assigned to another stylists at this time) and the wait would be 1 hour! Now a perm and cut usually takes about 3 hours and mom's portable O2 tank had enough in it to ensure we had time for the perm and the return home not an additional 1 hour wait! Seriously, who in the world who has an appointment book doesn't check it each day for their schedule? We left immediately and I & mom won't be back. Maybe Karma was trying to warn mom NOT to trust this shop with her hair and she may have avoided burning her entire head of hair and scalp off.",negative
My hair stylist didn't know how to do a side swept bang. She kept asking me how to do it. I'm not a hair stylist so I don't know how to do it but I know it looks stupid now. I'm paying you for your expertise otherwise I would have done it myself. I am extremely dissatisfied with my cut :( All I can do now it wait for it to grow out and go some place else next time.,negative
"Wow. Easily the WORST chop job I have ever seen. The asshole who did this cut must be BLIND. Multiple lengths, crooked, you name it. I'm 85% sure I could done better job wearing an eye patch. Great Clips in general are garbage. This place is WORSE. How many times can you ""gee I'm sorry, want your money back"" in a single day? And let you fix it? YEAH RIGHT. Like somehow it will magically not be a shitfest now that the manager is cutting it? PLEASE. You get one star because that's the absolute least Yelp allows. BEWARE. THIS PLACE IS TERRIBLE AND I'M RELATIVELY SURE THE POSITIVE REVIEWS ARE FROM THE CUTTER'S FRIENDS AND FAMILY. RUN! RUN FAR AWAY! Spend some money and have it done RIGHT. Have lengths that actually match! Have hair that's cut the way you want it cut! Have hair that doesn't look like it was cut by a drunk with hedge clippers! You deserve better than this apology farm with lots of scissors in it!",negative
Got my haircut by Taylor. Definitely a great stylist. I was scared at first because it was my first time here and first time with Taylor. Very nice and unique location. Will definitely be my go to Great Clips from now on.,positive
We have been coming her for quite a while. This location is in the Albertson's plaza and is open at 8am weekdays. I came up here on Tuesday among my running around doing everything that needed to be done before work because it was haircut time. Haircuts are usually $13 but I had a coupon for $8 haircut. So I used it. (When you go they get your address and you get coupons in the mail for future months.) I was happy with my haircut and walked out with half as much hair on my head as I did walking in....which is good with the summer coming up.,positive
"I don't even know if this is the right Great Clips (the one next to albertsons) but I came here today after a botched haircut I got from another salon a couple days before that, which has left me with endless nights of no sleep :( . So any who I came in and Chong aka this awesome skilled hairstylist from the deep dish Chicago area hooked me up with an amazing haircut and did her best to fix my botched choppy short hair into something I can walk around with during the daytime and people not thinking I'm the bride of Frankenstein. She saved my life in every way a person can be saved. (Here I go quoting titanic.) But lol no really my hair was so bad and she saved it at such an amazing price. The price was so cheap that I was nervous (or maybe it was cheap to me coming from New York where a trim cost like 40 dollars) but all in all this lady hooked me up and I got to practice my limited knowledge of Korean language on her. Anywho she's like a lifesaver making bad hair cuts beautiful again. Thank you!",positive
Our experience here was not even satisfactory. My husband checked in online. When we got there they told us his profile wasn't coming up but his name was on the screen. How is it that you're telling us we aren't checked in when our name is clearly on the screen. The wait time had also been pushed back as we walked in. They said they hold the spot an hour we got there early. Marissa calls my husband to cut his hair and he specifically asks for a medium fade from 0-2 and she takes the 0 all the way to the top of his head.... did not do a good job on the fade so it looks like he is wearing a rabbi cap. She didn't even give him a line up he had to ask her when she started brushing the hair off him. We won't be going back or recommending this place to anyone.,negative
In and out in 20 minutes with a nice haircut. Clean shop with pleasant stylist. Had a coupon so my haircut was at a reduced price. Very satisfied in every way. I am a man so I can't comment on lady's services.,positive
"The past 10 years I have used Great Clips at Aliante and on Ann & Simmons exclusively for cut, shampoo & styles. Today after I checked in on-line for Aliante and upon arrival, there was a girl (Janelle) who works there who hollered up at me while she was working on a client and in front of the entire store's staff and clients. Come to find out she's the Manager of the store. She said ""you know it's going to be $50 just to style your shoulder-length hair plus the cut and the shampoo will bring it up to $78 bucks"". She proceeded to tell me that it's a Great Clips' guideline over the past several months. Well...I go in twice a month for shampoo and style; pay the usual $19 PLUS an $11 tip for God's sake bringing the tab to $30. When she explained in front of everyone in the store that I am mistaken, that did it for me...I chose to go to the Ann location. I explained the situation to them and the style charge for shoulder-length hair is $24. So... they weren't sure why I was quoted $50 at Aliante-particularly when I was having my hair cut short! This review is more for Great Clips management (Leona) than for the general public. However, I would never recommend the Aliante location due to this one incident perpetrated by the store Manager.",negative
Always a quick in and out and no one has hacked all my hair off just yet. Argentina was amazing and such a friendly person to chat with while getting a much needed trim and cut for my bangs. I'll be seeing her again when I need a trim in Las Vegas :),positive
"If you want it done right, ask for Marisa. She knows how to cut blonde hair, how to cut for your face shape, just ask. Same with everything. You never know till you ask. Thanks Marisa congrats on manager! Most others I'd give 4 stars but for one of them I'd give 2 stars. Cant remember her name.. Better safe than sorry!",positive
"Fast and efficient at reasonable price. Really liked the twilight discount and the prompt service I received. My stylist was friendly and did a great job for the most part. There was a small section that got missed but it was very difficult to notice unless you were looking closely in the mirror. I was able to take care of it at my house. Anyways, since I usually cut my own hair I probably won't be back here but if I had to go get my hair cut by someone again I would come back. All in all I have no complaints about my visit here. To paint a better picture of my experience I showed up and waited about 10 minutes. There were two or three other people in front of me and three hairstylist. I highly recommend that if you do go to one of the stores that you check in online as it will make your stance much quicker. I was there a total of 30 minutes from start to finish.",positive
"If I could give 0 stars I would, the lady that cut my hair barely spoke any English and used some outdated clippers. She totally ruined my hair. I usually go to the Winterwood location where they are a lot more better at their job. Anyways when I go to pay I give them a coupon to save a few dollars and the manager said they don't accept them, I never had a problem before. I will definitely not be back!",negative
Got a hair cut today at this location and staffs are not really paying attention to the customer request. They were to busy chit chatting with each other. I ask for fade only on the side of my head and totally shave all my hair which I could done it my self. Those locations is breading place for new bees and I won't highly recommend this place. They will try to be friendly with so you won't complain about their uneven haircut. This place is sucks.. definitely won't go back again..,negative
This place is great for an inexpensive hair cut. You can check in online and there really is not much of a wait. The staff are very friendly and listen to what you want.,positive
"I usually take my kids to get their cuts here and I've never had an issue. I decided to take my mother to get a trim here and checked in online as I always do, there was one person ahead of us, and she said we were next. A family of 4 came in after us and the lady at the counter asked them if they had checked in online, she replied no so she checked them in. The one person ahead of us was called and we saw on the screen that my mother was next. As soon as the next stylist became available we thought we were going to be called next, however she called the person after us. I approached her and brought it up and she told me they had checked in online and they were before us. It made me more upset that she thought I was that stupid to believe her, I clearly saw my mothers name next on the screen and heard her conversation. Because of this I will NOT be taking my kids here anymore.",negative
"This is a good location and business to receive a quick quality haircut. If you check in online, or using the app, it usually will save you a few minutes wait time. They store your previous haircut information, and ask you if you want the same type of cut. Friendly staff.",positive
"Great clips is not really known for great haircuts...from previous experiences. However, this place exceeded my expectations. I got a cut from Brittany and she was nice and friendly but most importantly she knew how to cut hair. I will definitely be back to get my bi - monthly haircut.",positive
"I live about 30 minutes away with many other hair cut spots on the way but I come back to see Stephanie because she does a fantastic job and I know we will leave happy. My son loves her and she is able to work with his crazy hair and leaves it looking great until his next hair cut. She did my daughter's first haircut today and made her first experience, comfortable and most of all she had my daughter smiling the entire time. I highly recommend this spot. Everyone always welcomes you with a smile and they do awesome work.",positive
"Just sat in Great Clips among many tired customers on a busy Saturday and listened to three stylists argue for 15 minutes over who took whose customer. When I approached them at the register and suggested that this wasn't the time to figure this out, they said they had to figure it out now before taking anymore customers. I said I was ready to walk out and did shortly after as they continued their argument. I went in back in to ask for the business owner's contact information. I was given a number for corporate because the owner ""doesn't allow his information to be given out"". If I was an owner, I would want to know my employees acted this way.",negative
"I had to return because the cut received was so poor. After re-cut, still looked awful. Would not recommend unless getting a complete shave.",negative
I don't know what to read it yet because I just have a question. Does this place color hair too? I've been reading some of the reviews for haircuts and what not but I wonder if great clips colors hair? UPDATE: I have a wonderful person who cut my hair at this location. She even styled it a little bit...she did a really great job in regards to my layers and informing me of how often I should come back. I'll be back over there in less than six weeks. Thank you. I would recommend you go there for a great haircut and wonderful customer service.,positive
Jennifer cut my hair. I had her just follow what i already had just freshen it up by getting rid of the dead ends. She did a great job. She was very pleasant and got me in and out but not rushed. Will come back.,positive
I guess checking in online no longer does you any good. I was the top person on a list on 9 and had to wait to the end because I didn't check in according to the lady at the desk. Doesn't that defeat the whole purpose of the app? I've been to a half dozen other great clips with no problem with the online checkin but I guess the ladies don't like technology and demand you come to the desk and check in. Not only was she rude in front of many people but told me it's like checking it for dinner. Thanks for the extra hour wait! Last time coming to this store. Don't be scared of change!,negative
"The associates at this location are by the nicest group I've met. Not only do they have a nice flow and work well with others but their hair styles are experienced and do a great job. I usually never get my hair cut here because I had a terrifying experience at a great clips as a child... they cut off half when it was only a trim so when I visited this location it was purely because I was going crazy with my out grown hair and my father along with my husband go to this exact location so I decided to give them a shot... They rock! I was greeted at the door, helped in a times manner and my hair cut was fantastic!",positive
Maria thanks for the great cut 5 stars thanks pat . Maria she was efficient and also pays attention to details even checks her work does a wonderful styled hair cut. Nice job.,positive
"If I could give them a zero I would. The customer service is awful and the young girl up front is a smart ass. We checked in online and it said a 57 min wait. We arrived exactly at that time and the girl stated it would be another 15 min, so what is the point of online checking times if they are not accurate? Try to go somewhere else if you can as this place sucks on all accounts.",negative
"I don't know about anyone else, but I hate the online check in. I don't use it, I just go in and see how long it'll take and decide if I'll wait or not. I've been sitting here for 30 minutes already because online check ins beat me to a couple spots. That system is flawed and if someone checks in and brings 4 people, it throws the whole order out. Nothing wrong with the stylists here, they've always been good but they seem under staffed at peak times and the online check in has a room full of people that hasn't changed much in fifteen mintues.",negative
The online check-in tool is the greatest thing since sliced bread. I'm in and out quickly and my haircut is good 99% of the time. No business nails it 100% of the time.,positive
"I went in to get a haircut and of course I already knew what I wanted. I shower the girl that was cutting my hair a picture of what I wanted and she nailed it! I love my new haircut. The only thing I had a problem with was how long the wait was. When I walked in I wasn't even greeted, and no one asked to sign me in. So while I was sitting there I checked in online to make sure my spot was saved. Their was nine people on their list by the time I was called and only 3 girls cutting hair, but their was more people in their backroom laughing and chatting. I could tell that some of the people waiting were a little uneasy. Next time I'll check in before I get there and maybe call and ask hoe many people are waiting ahead.",positive
"I would rate lower if I could. These people do not know how to cut hair or keep customers in order. They have messed up my boys haircuts so often that I now take them elsewhere. My cut is simple, a 2 on to & 1 on the sides. I still went there because it was convenient. Today I checked in online with a 17 min wait. I ran into the store next door then went to great clips. That usually means you'll have a few mins wait as it ""holds your place in line"". After I checked in & was told it would be just a moment. Then I watched as 4 other people came in & were taken back before i was. Now this wouldn't be all bad as 3 said they checked in online. It was possible they did so before I did (although not likely). The other guy did not check in online & was told it would probably be abt 15 mins. As I sat there over 15 mins (what is the point of the online check in at this point) and waited patiently, they then call the guy who did not check in online & arrived about 10 mins after me. When I said something as he was still standing there, I was told I would be next. This is unacceptable. I walked out. They will never see another dime from me or my family. I highly do not recommend unless you want a bad cut or your time waisted. There is a barber shop in the same plaza on the other side of Albertsons that will take care of you in a timely manner & won't give you a bad hair cut.",negative
"So we are still avid visitors and since my last review we have received pretty great service. Today's visit was just as great. Brittany was patient with my son, suggestive as to how to get the look he wanted, she even explained what she was doing and checked in with me to see what I thought. The friendliness of the staff is great from the moment you walk in to the moment you say good bye.",positive
"I come in here every once in a while when my personal stylist is not available. Although nearly every time I walk out of their doors, I am not completely satisfied. Recently, a few weeks after my trim here, I went to my personal stylist for a revamp. She immediately questioned, ""who did your hair?!?"" I had NO idea that the ends of my hair were cut to a diagonal. How could any stylist allow their customer to walk out like that?! I get it, maybe she was having an off day, but as I stated, it is not often that I leave very content with my hair. Additionally, many of the employees work a little too fast and it makes me nervous that they're not striving for a precise cut (I am an example).",negative
"Went in here on Mother's Day to get a haircut as my usual spot was closed. I knew my hair was gonna get jacked up and I was right. I got a fade on my right side, but my left side is a solid 1 all the way up. Oh well just confirmed my thoughts on great clips. Now I get to tell my friends I got ""great clipped"".",negative
"Now I have tried many salons and barber shops here in vegas! Often times I have been disappointed. I stumbled into this great clips after having a terrible experience at a high end salon and thought I would just drop in to get a quick cut, anything would have been better than my last experience. Aprehensive I sat down and explain to the gentleman Jamie that I had a bad experience at the last place I tried (mind you cost me $50 for a men's cut). He assured me I would be taken care of and got it right the first time. I recommend you download the app, check in online and ask for Jamie! He is incredible and very talented. But also has a great personality and easy to get along with. He is the one I see every two weeks and because of his talent and customer service 5 stars Great Clips! You guys have a gem in your salon. I will follow him wherever he goes as long has he cuts hair.",positive
Awesome hair cute! Thank you so much Gina ! So excited for prom and she even made my bangs even when before they weren't! Thank you so much! Would recommend!,positive
"My son needed a hair cut and the lady was very nice! It's not often that my husband is happy with his or our son's hair cut. But he was happy this time. And what was nice was that there was no wait today. My son came out looking exactly like his dad!! I suggest going during the week, during the day, because there is less traffic.",positive
"I received a coupon in my personal email regarding $5 less in regular haircut. When we were about to pay, the bar code was scanned but JONI (another hairstylist) interrupted and shouted across the room saying that mobile coupon is NOT allowed (even if it already went in and reduced $5). I don't understand why it is not accepted. Then she kept shouting while there were a lot of people that my coupon is invalid. This pissed me off because JONI could have said it in a polite way but she just kept going making it seem like I got the coupon elsewhere or made it up. That girl was so UNPROFESSIONAL.",negative
"I've been getting my men's haircut by Elaine since last year at this Salon, and she's done a great job each time. I didn't mind a 2-hour wait to get my usual haircut the other day--she's worth the wait.",positive
Awesome experience ! Great experience w Brittany S. nicest employee I've met yet at a great clips . I highly recommend her !,positive
The stylists here are great with my kids! Always a great cut and it doesn't take much time at all. I like being able to check in online.,positive
This place is bullshit my husband check in and we've been waiting for 1hr then we walked out they took people who dont check in online first it looks like they pick people they want to serve they dont follow on who ever gets check in first or whoever gets in first we are so upset about it.,negative
I can't thank Joni enough for fixing an absolute scalping that I got at another chain hair stylist shop. They have my business forever.,positive
"My go to place for a haircut. I love them for the reasonable prices - $12 for a men's haircut and for the online check in. I never wait for a haircut and that to me is awesome. The service is always good and the staff is super friendly and take good care of me. They have notes on my last haircut to make things easy. The inside is always clean despite the constant cutting of hair going on. The keep the place tidy between customers unlike some other places I have been to. Once done with your haircut the checkout is super fast and you are on your way looking better and ready for whatever the day brings. I highly recommend you get their App and start using them for your haircuts. Great service, online check-ins and good prices - what more could you ask for!",positive
"I checked in and calculated my time to get there just in time to be in the chair. I had the bad surprise of them taking other people in front of me that supposedly checked in for one person and brought with them 2 more pushing my waiting time for another 20 minutes. I got up and told them that I don't need my appointment any more, and the woman rudely told me ""ok sounds good"". In that case, lady how does my bad review on yelp ""sounds ""???? This location sucks will never go back!!! I ended up going to the warm springs and Durango location and got in the chair right away without any appointment or the stupid check in that is not accurate at",negative
Horrible customer service. I was not approached at all and was the ONLY person waiting. And what made it even better was that every stylist was on their phones and talking! Will definitely not be coming back here. Don't come here if you want lousy service.,negative
Joni & Elaine did a great job with both are kids haircuts. Got mine right after. They were both very nice & professional. Would definitely recommend this place.,positive
I always go to anna for my haircuts! If your looking for a good fade with the right clippers! She keeps her fades tight and clean!,positive
Been here for 30 minutes and counting. Checked in at 1:30pm on the app and says 15 minute wait. I get here at 1:50pm and there are 8 people checked in before me.,negative
Was just there is think I made a great decision to leave... I waited patiently for my turn only to find out I was gonna be skipped. The ones that they decided to prioritized were the two they already called and were not there. No communication from the people that worked there about what's going on! They didn't even wanna look at me after they decided to take two others before me that arrived after me. It was my first time at great Clips and I'm glad I saved myself from anymore bad decisions by staying there. This place has no customer service. You can tell by the way they talk to you and ask you questions that they don't know proper communication. And as a first timer they made me feel more embarrassed of being one then making me feel welcome. I have never gotten or came for the discounts of this place but I will never accept there discounted cuts if they will also discount the already poor service they offer. I should have know better anyways. Going to the salon should be a treat not a nightmare and I will let everybody I know personally and in social media that this establishment are ones that you just ignore even if it were the last salons in the world... if I could give a negative 10 star I would,negative
"I visited this shop, first i have no good experience, after awhile gave another try and got worst cut, and that would be my last visit here!",negative
"Worst haircut I've ever received. Told her to trim the top and the side a 1, low fade. She decided to disregard my request and gave me a high fade, then butchered one side of my head. Had to go back to get it fixed and she cut the top super short and still left a bunch of long hairs and left my hair uneven. Been wearing a hat everywhere Tim my hair grows back a bit to fix it. I didn't want to go bald or really short. Will never return here even if they gave me free hair cuts. I gave myself better hair cuts in the military.",negative
"My son usually goes to the S. Durango location but we came to this location for the first time since they were open on Easter Sunday and will NEVER come back! My son checked in online as he usually does and gets called within a few minutes (the only positive from this visit) More and more people start to come in (some check-ins and some walk-ins). There were 3 stylists working and the one lady (don't remember her name but she was the older one and was caucasian, the other 2 ladies were asian and hispanic) closest to front counter was rude when customers checking in would ask for an approximate wait time. She would say ""we're doing the best we can"" in a rude tone when all the customer wants to know is if he has time to walk to albertsons. I understand you're feeling overwhelmed because the salon went from 2 customers to about 5-6 waiting but that doesn't mean you have to be rude. Anyway, my son finishes his haircut and I go to pay and she seemed to rush me. As soon as the receipt printed she threw it on the counter then also threw the pen on the counter. As I started to sign she was impatiently waiting for my copy of the receipt to print out. Then I asked if they had gift cards and right away she says no once again in a rude tone. I shouldn't have left her a tip! We definitely won't be coming back here!",negative
I come here a couple times when i need a quick fade. Sometimes i cant make it downtown to where my usual barber short is. But it still does the job. Especially dor the price. I mean... You dont get the usual barber talk. But you still get what you want for the most part.,negative
I haven't gone to great clips in a while because I'm trying to grow out my hair. I haven't had any complaints whatsoever with the stylists that have done my hair. I was really pleased and my hair is growing out beautifully. I would definitely go again if I need my annual haircut. I would recommend the manager for the ladies. He does a really great job! :D,positive
Great Clips is the best place to cut your hair especially this one. They are extremely nice people. The service is wonderful. I always have a wonderful experience. The always have a big selection in haircuts.,positive
Convenient and close to home! Great customer service. Receive a discount for writing a review...awesome! Great price and great stylists,positive
"We all know that sometimes people get busy and are unable to provide good customer service, which is always reasonable. Unfortunately, this establishment had several opportunities to provide us with DESCENT customer service and has failed every chance they were given. They provided us with inaccurate estimation of time. They were not able to check us in on three accounts. They took a couple of people ahead of us even though we were waiting there first. Overall, l they left a very distasteful taste in my mouth. I highly suggest to find a different hair salon shop. This place was TERRIBLE!",negative
"Used to love taking my son here to get his haircut. But even checking in early online on my iphone app, I found myself waiting for a while at their register to be waited on. I was ignored by the 3 people who saw me. So we sat down since I thought we already did the online check in. Then 2 other customers walked in and they were greeted immediately. I had to let the lady know at the register that I have been waiting and the customer let me talk to her. So my son was up next. Just very poor service. Will not come here again. It's too bad the guy who always cut my son's hair doesn't work there anymore. He was an A++. Always fantastic!",negative
"Came in with my husband here and the lady was just plain DISRESPECTFUL. My husband told me to explain how he wants his cut to the lady and when i did, she just told me to go sit cos i dont have to come with him and when i started explaining she gave me an attitude and kept yawning. Wth? Really. On top of that he had to make my husband repeat everything i said and act like nothing happened. Picked this place coz it was the closest and our usual stylist is out. Definetely not coming back here. I can't stand her attitude!",negative
"This is the only Great Clips that does NOT have a monitor visible to the guest to see where you are in line. Which leads to incidents like I had where I checked in online, and then watched as people who arrived after me kept getting called. The stylist said they also checked in online. My 15 minute quote only became 27 because somebody gave up his turn. Without a visible monitor I had to believe the stylist. Who proceeded to give me a rushed, crappy cut while telling me how the other person was ok waiting, ""he's a regular"". Awkward situation & bad haircut = Never going to this location again.",negative
Have been going to this location for 9 years. Staff are friendly and do a good job. Sometimes busy but the online check in speeds things up.,positive
Normally get my haircut at the barber or do it myself but was in a rush running errands and stopped in here. I like the online check in app they have. It makes it a lot quicker and more convenient. The lady that cut my hair was pleasant and did a good job. Normally they ever get it right on the sides cause they don't go low enough but she did a good job. Place was clean but for the price they charge now I'd rather pay a couple extra and get the barbershop experience.,positive
The best great clips in the area. All of the stylists I have had have been great. Going to the same great clips is nice because they keep your hairstyle in the computer. Each of my boys has their style done the same way each time. Use the online checkin no matter what. Because you can spend your time waiting at home or getting a coffee.,positive
"Choose other locations! I understand it's cheap, but the 2 haircuts my boys got were terrible! By 2 different stylists! One kid's sideburns was shorter than 1 inch than on the other side. When I pointed this out after he came back to me, the stylist just shrugged and rolled her eyes and kept cutting her current victim's hair. So, I went to the other stylist who was still cutting my other kid's hair. She said sorry, leaned over and snipped it. I guess I should have been grateful. My second kid's haircut seemed better, but his hair wasn't blended in well. Edward Scissorhands probably could have done better. The reason I pay for this service is that I can't do it and don't even pretend to, but come on! Will NOT return to this location- find other locations instead.",negative
"This place is a joke. Granted you get what you pay for, and going in I had zero expectations of service, friendliness, and even kindness. What I got, was still mind-blowing on how awful the people were. I called prior to coming in, asked if they were confident in the cut I was looking for. I was promised that between the 3 hairstylists they could help. I was not asking for a difficult cut, just a long pixie with it stacked in the back. I provided pictures, asked for no length in the front to be taken off. The hairstylist began to cut, first cut being length off the front. I stopped her, asked her once again to not cut the length in the front. She continued cutting, as I was sitting there watching, it was nothing what I asked for. She was rude, very condescending and would continuously cut me off as I was attempting to explain what I wanted. I started to get upset, crying, and she continued making rude comments/remarks that everyone in the place could hear. Then, other customers chimed in on our conversation and joined her in belittling me and making negative comments. I was baffled. This lady directly in front of me spoke of me negatively with other people. This upset me even more, and she refused to cut my hair any further. She asked her coworker to finish. As I moved chairs, I attempted to hold back my tears and explain to the gentleman on how I would like to ""fix"" it. He refused to make one cut on my hair. He said he did not feel comfortable cutting my hair, which the original hairstylist said ""I dont blame you"" from the other side of the salon while another customer sat in her chair. Then, the two began to once again talk negatively about me as I sat there once again crying. I asked for the manager, which the lady who was the original stylist spoke up and said it was her. REALLY?? This was the rude, condescending lady, who is supposed to be a manager, be professional and provide customer service?? I left with a half cut head of hair. I attempted to call the customer service line, made a report, and have not heard a word since. I created a Yelp account for this reason only, to warn others of the complete lack of respect this entire place provides. Save yourself. I will never return.",negative
"This has been my neighborhood Great Clips for about 6 years, and I have had mixed results. Always different stylists, so if you find one that you like, chances are they will not be there when you return in a few months. The last one that I had was really good. She took some time with me, asking me about how I normally style my hair, what products do I use, and listened to my answers. The cut was great and easy to maintain. So when I need a trim to keep it looking good, I find out that she no longer works there. The woman who cut my hair seated me without introduction, asked how I was and what were we doing today? I showed her the picture of my favorite style (which, by now, I'm used to not getting but it's a basis for discussion) and said I wanted a trim. She didn't ask what I liked about the style, or what I use to get it that way. She didn't ask how much length to take off, just started cutting away. She probably took about 7 minutes in all. When it was done, it was not horrible, but in no way what I had asked for. When I came home, I had to cut some of the unevenness from the side and the back (what I could see). It's short and not the style that I know how to work with. I realize that you are not paying a lot for a haircut here; however, you have a reasonable expectation that the stylists will accommodate you and your individual needs, no matter the cost. I give this location 2 stars only because it didn't always suck and the online check-in service is better than sitting around and waiting.",negative
"I have been going to this Great Clips ever since I started getting Jessica as a stylist as she is truly amazing!! All of their staff are courteous and do a nice job but Jessica is very funny, personable, and gives a stellar haircut!!! I will not go anywhere else and if there is a shorter wait at a closer location I will drive the extra miles and sit and wait for her. Thank you Jessica!!!",positive
"Most unprofessional haircut ever! My hairstylist asked me to stand up, so she can cut my hair in the back. She only spent 5 mins to cut my hair, and I have long hair with layers. Never ever wrote any review on Yelp before, but I am so pissed. Just don't waste your money here. Period.",negative
"This salon has a lot of improving to do. Good thing they got rid of that guy we always seemed to get who seemed nazi-esque with kids...yelled at my little one about moving when he squirted water right at his face, didn't block the spray from hitting his face or warn him. Now we seem to consistently get women who can't cut straight. And don't go in near closing time...they clean the floor with that blue bactericidal stuff and you about choke from the fumes...I got attitude when I asked if they could wait until after we left.",negative
"OMG I have been coming to this salon for about 9 months and today I got truly lucky! I'm so phys'd!! I got this girl Mary and for the first time ever I left the salon feeling great ~ instead of thinking ""well I will like it when I do it my self."" I was so happy! She listened to what I said and she told me it wouldn't lay like I thought it would because of my thin hair. She suggested a variation of the same cut and she was totally right on!! Mary rocks!! Great Clips rocks!! KD",positive
"Their computer is down today, every one was checked in manually upon arrival. As it turned out they failed to check me in and you guessed it, when I brought it to their attention when they started taking customers who checked in after me for haircuts they then checked me in, back of the line. I asked if I had to wait at the end of the list or was I next. The lady said I was next...not even an apology....BAD!!! You guessed it, someone else was called and my feet walked out of their store with my cash. I won't be back...ever!!! You gotta be kidding!!!",negative
Ok - I don't get my hair cut here but the boy does. It's a in/out hair place so don't expect something from a salon or barber. While the wait was a little longer than expected(20 mins) they did advertise you could check-in online so you didn't have to wait. The hair dressers were very friendly and pretty quick. Good job on a hair cut at a budget price. Not much you can complain about. For guys - fast/ efficient way to get groomed. Next time we will be trying the online check-in though.,negative
"OMG! I've been going to this location for a little over a year with no issues and good results. Went there yesterday and didn't recognize any of the 'hair cutters' that were there. All I needed was about an inch off the top and trimmed around the ears and neck. So Kelly makes a couple angled cuts in the middle of my head and trims the back, stands back and says ""how's that"". I said ""take a little more off the top"". WAY big mistake. She took a couple big chops off the top, buzzed around the ears and I was done. I knew this was going to be ugly. Went home took a shower and my wife and son said ""what the heck happened to your hair"". Had to run over to Arizona Hair where Eric repaired the mess caused by Kelly at Great Clips. Never again will I step foot in another Great Clips and stay away from Kelly at this location.",negative
"wow, this lady Angelica. She asked me what I wanted and did the opposite. Good thing I look good with short hair. She asked if I wanted my hair short and spiked. I said no and asked her to leave the top so I can slick my hair back. I have short spiked hair now.",negative
"I got my hair cut by Nia who did an awesome wonderwoman Tattoo on it. It was my first time at this salon and first time getting this style. I was SO happy with the result. Nia was friendly, fast and did quality work. The salon itself is nice and they offer you tea/coffee. Nia is new to this location but I know she has experience cutting men's hair since my friends go to her so I was pumped to try her at the new location and she did not disappoint. There was no wait time and I was in and out. I LOVE my cut and everyone stops me to ask about it. Thanks Nia!!!!",positive
I've had my hair coloured by Anya for years and she's fantastic. I even followed her to Hair Artisans from her previous salon.I don't tend to go in for my colour regularily but Anya has magic hands so somehow my hair looks great months after my colour job. During my latest visit I got rose brown hair and it came out even better than the reference photos I brought in. My hair also feels luxuriously silky.,positive
"Summary: -I SPENT $550 (including generous tips) on hair that looked horrible. I was scolded by the colourist who said my hair looked like the picture when it most certainly did not. After the owner tried to fix it, it arguably looked worse. -Balayage skill level is not high amongst this particular colourist and the owner. -Sinead the cheery Irish girl did a great job on the cut. -Spent an additional $300 (tip included) at another salon in Guelph, Ontario to get the colour fixed Full story: I had booked an appointment with Ryan because he did my friend's hair (note she is a blonde) and I didn't have a colorist in Toronto. This was the first time I had ever dyed my hair at a salon and before I could get the balayage that I wanted done, I would have to pay $80 plus tip to release some previous colour from my hair. After getting the ""cocktail"" (which is what he called it) done, he noted that the previous colour lifted so well he probably didn't have to do that Steph. It would have been better if he hadn't told me because now I'm out $100(cocktail plus the tip).but I know there is no way to be able to tell that in advance and it is better to be safe than sorry. The day of my balayage appointment he tried a method which I can say to this day I have never seen done in order to achieve a balayage. It was horrible: I was in the chair for 5.5 hours JUST for foils. He would section off the smallest little pieces on my head, which I didn't say anything about because I wanted to see if maybe he knew a better way than I had seen before. He mentioned that himself and the owner taught balayage classes at the salon which I don't know how that is possible because of the pictures I will be showing later. Because it took so long and I had to get to work, I had to leave the salon with wet hair and I had to style it myself. I got home and did just that and was horrified that I had over 150 thin highlights in a very weird ashy blonde (almost grey looking) colour. My coworkers tried to feign their love for my new do but eventually when I got it fixed by someone else they told me how bad it was. I went back the next day and when I told Ryan I didn't like it he came off SUPER defensive and told me that that was exactly what I had asked for and that the colour in the picture was the same as my hair and that balayage looks better curled and my hair was not curled so I didn't know that it looked exactly like the picture. His aggressive tone and the fact that I had IN TOTAL spent $550 (cocktail, tip, ""balayage"", tip, olaplex, toner) made me cry. I had spend so much money on hair I really DID NOT LIKE. the owner was kind enough to call him away from me and asked to fix my hair for me. I just believe the skill level between Ryan and Rebecca aren't there for balayage. She tried to fix it and after the over processed mess that I had in my hair before she got to it, another process probably wasn't the answer. It was uneven (she started with the left side of my head, then right, then back. When most colourists starts bottom to top.) I had noticed my left side was much blonder than my right and much more processed. In the end, I had to go to my hairstylist in Guelph, ON to get the whole mess fixed. She is great, and did it in one hour foils (which was amazing considering it took 5.5 hours to begin my hair tragedy). It was a fraction of the cost, ONLY $300. Another thing to note is that Teija (my Guelph hairstylist) is on team canada for OMC hairworld competition and she charges more reasonable prices.",negative
"I got my hair dyed by Ryan and he is good. No complaints about his skills. What I am unhappy about was the service I received. I made an appointment right before the busy holiday season and maybe that's why but I just felt really rushed, among other incidents that happened that day. One of the staff who was washing my hair actually said to me, ""How is the head massage? Your people gives the best massage."" I couldn't believe what I just heard from her. I never mentioned my ethnicity to her so I have no clue what 'my people' she was referring to. Also, every time I get my hair washed here, no matter who does it, I always have shampoo in my ears. They aren't careful at all. It's pretty awful to have your ear full of shampoo residue and water. On another note, although this is completely out of the salon's control, the clientele they have can be quite rude. My friend was told to leave the salon if he had a cold (which he didn't). She was quite passive aggressive. Might have something to do with the salon's neighbourhood-but that's of course just an assumption. For the price I paid, I can get much better service somewhere else.",negative
I had a haircut by JJ this morning. I haven't had one since the last time I was there (which was February (2013). My hair is long and one length. I had a long chat with JJ and I put my trust (and hair) in his hands. I wasn't brave enough to do anything too crazy. Plus I didn't want to have to do anything in the mornings besides wash and go. He trimmed about two inches off the back and sides and gave me long layers in the front. Looks and feels great!,positive
"I came here because a colleague had an amazing cut and the salon was near my office. So I called and got a lunch apt. with Sinead. I brought along a picture of a cut I liked but the last hairdresser I had wasn't able to achieve that style to my disappointment. After an analysis, Sinead explained how she would do it by giving more volume at the top and cutting more at the bottom to help give that flip and lift I desperately wanted. She also explained how I should blow dry my hair and what type of shampoo I should use after I asked a lot of questions. My blowdry was amazing, wow, she manipulated the round brush super quickly, I had never seen that before. I've had blowdries elsewhere but the other stylists was slow. The salon was very busy and it was a Tuesday. It was packed for colour and cut. When I left, there were people waiting for their turn. I paid $55 because I got a $20 off since it was my first visit. I can tell you that there's a difference paying $75 vs $55 (what I use to pay elsewhere in Yorkville) for a cut. I also gave a big tip, very important! You get a more experienced hairdresser but also someone who has a different level of technique. I will definitely come back, really happy with the results. Thank you!",positive
"Moving to a new area is always difficult but finding someone you can trust to do your hair has always been a biggie. We've moved a few times over the years and I've never been lucky to get the ""one"" on the first try. I finally lucked out this time, Elise is awesome! She not only took the time to get to know me but what I wanted and actually listened. When she made suggestions, it was based on what I said and her incredible knowledge. While I thought my hair suffered this past year because of health problems, Elise proved me wrong and I was able to keep my long hair! I wished I was good with taking selfies because my hair looks awesome! I'll be sure to have her snap a pic the next time I go. I'm also sorry I don't have a ""before and after"" pic because she rocks. I have no doubt that my hair will look even better on my next visit as I'm still a work in progress and I know that Elise will make that happen. She is wise beyond her years and knows what looks good on you. She'll also do what ""you"" thinks looks good with no judgment. In other words, the perfect hair professional. I look forward to having her remake what I ""thought"" looked good and she's well on her way! Thank you Elise for making me feel beautiful again.",positive
"I can't tell you enough how happy I am to have such a great hair stylist! She is always up with the latest trends and she is so knowledgeable about hair color/extensions. She is so friendly and easygoing. Elise makes sure that you leave her chair feeling happy and confident in your new hair. I wouldn't go to anyone else! Thank you, Elise!",positive
"Elise is the best, I've been going to her for years for cut color and extensions. She's highly experienced in all areas of hair & I've always love my results. Highly recommend!!",positive
"I found this store in the yelp with so many good comments.So I text her for the appointment and describe my hair extension work.At first,she was very enthusiastic,after knowing my extension area only with the bang,so she did not give me any respond anymore.I thought she was busy,I try to call her for several times,leave the voicemail,no answer anymore.Here is to let you know, this is not the way you treat the customer .Aso want other people to know that,from this side,this salon will not be your right choice.",negative
"Elise is amazing! I have been getting keratin bonded extensions from her for about two years now, and my hair has grown so long and is incredibly healthy. At first I was paranoid that the extensions would damage my hair but she assured me that as long as I followed her instructions that would not be the case, and she was right!! I cannot imagine letting anyone else touch my extensions. She is a master artist.",positive
Love Elise!! She's been doing my hair for about 2 1/2 years (moved to Vegas from CA). My friend recommended her and I am happy that she did (it's hard to find a good hairstylist when you move to a new city ) She's always done a great job on my hair/color and is the only person that I trust here. She's one of the sweetest girls I know. Definitely recommend her!!!,positive
"As A Phi Microblading Artist beautiful hair is as important as beautiful brows! Skill, quality & service comes in the care of the artist.",positive
"So my first visit to Joni's was Friday 05-04-18. I was actually going for an eyebrow wax. I've been going to several different salons throughout the valley for years, and I must say I am finally ""home "" After previous negative experiences I trusted YELP for guidance and it did not fail me. I specifically typed eyebrow waxing and Hair by Joni came up. Although I wasn't seeking hair services I was impressed by the ratings. My thought was if he's that amazing with hair, then he's got to be off the charts with waxing...He was!! He took his time and was very methodical. He trimmed,plucked,threaded I got the works! He explained where my arch should be and how we were going to work on getting it back.Eyebrows are huge when making a first impression, I usually notice that first when I meet someone and I left pleased and super confident about my experience. I Will definitely be returning and I've already told several of my girlfriends the place to go! Thank you Joni, for a wonderful job!",positive
"Went to Joni for eyebrows, hair, exc. For years..followed him from old salon when he opened this one Hands down best eye brow threading ever!! Great cut, color, and styling as well.. He's the best!!",positive
"If your looking for a hair salon, Hair by Joni is the place to go. I have had the best experience and it has now become the only hair salon will be going to. Joni came up and confirmed my name, introduced himself and treated me with nothing but respect. My next introduction was a fabulous stylist Rusel. I have psorais my scalp and they didn't treat me like a freak, and didn't try to get me to color my hair and with was done with guidance and respect. Rusel did give me a beautiful hair cut with a little flair and sassyness I asked for. Since I didn't get the color I went with a brow/lip wax, it was nearly pain free. I highly recommend Hair by Joni and asking for Rusel.",positive
"Went to get my damaged by box color hair corrected. I was worried about the damage due to the box. Joni took care of it! Added color and hi-lights without further damage. He added stuff to prevent any damage. He did an amazing job and I could not be happier!! Even made me a delicious cappuccino while the color set. While washing I had the best head massage ever! I almost fell asleep. Sent me home with some samples of amazing smelling shampoo! Thank you Joni, I will be back!",positive
"I have long hair, mid back, and VERY particular about who cuts my hair. My hair dresser, who is also a close personal friend, has been unavailable for an extended time, leading my hair not being cut in 9 months. So... in very desperate need of a cut I asked her who she would recommend. She referred me to Joni. I called and was able to get an appointment the same day. I was resigned to losing most of my length due to my neglect and failure to maintain my regular trims. Joni is a miracle worker! I only lost about 4 inches and my hair looks MARVELOUS. He listened to my concerns and made suggestions based on my hair type and face shape. I am so excited and happy with his expertise. I scheduled my next appointment before leaving. Thank you Joni for everything you did.",positive
I'll start my review at a 5 since I haven't been there yet and I'll update it after my apt on Sat. I called and they were very friendly. Got an apt for Sat. They told me to come early for a consult. I have a pic in my head and in pics of what I want but you know sometimes that can't be translated to your actual hair. So let's see what they can do. I'm super excited especially after reading the reviews. The last place I went you couldn't even tell they put color in my hair. She wouldn't even look at my pics of what I wanted. So I'm excited to go somewhere where they are passionate about what they do. I'm hoping I've finally found my for forever hair home. I'll finish my review Sat. When in and got exactly what I wanted. Not only that Joni actually looked at my pics and talked to me about each one and the pros & cons. My color was perfect. My hair looks so healthy. I'm in love it. Joni makes a mean cup of cappuccino too lol. I'll definitely be going here from now on for my cut and color needs. I also should add he is fast. Most places I've gone I'll be there 3 to 4 hour's for cut and color. Joni did 3 colors and cut. 2 hours and 15 mins. It looked this great. Unbelievable!!,positive
"I called for a haircut, shampoo and style and that's what I got! I am happy with my service I received from Joni. I will be back for another haircut and some color! Not only is he great but can get you in too. So it was a win win!",positive
"Very excited for founding the best place to do my hair. RUSEL cut my hair in the best way. I hVe a lot of hair in it is very difficult to have a nice cut. People in the salon is very friendly. I love this new finding and I will continue going. Highly recommended!!,",positive
"I had a wonderful first time experience at Hair by Joni. I was offered different coloring techniques and explained to in full the benefits of each one. I was use to having my colored the same way for 10 years, and was so pleasantly surprised by the new technique I tried. My hair looks perfect, and as an added bonus it was a fun experience. Joni and Rusel are such sweet and kind people, you feel like you are hanging out with family instead being a customer they are trying to rush out of the door. I will definitely continue to go there as well as bring my children there. :)",positive
"Time for an update on my update... Joni is every bit as fantastic, friendly, professional and downright FANTASTIC (I know I already said that but it is worth repeating) as he was the first time I walked through his door. Joni is a gem on both a professional and personal level. I would give him 100 stars if I could and besides that he makes a wonderful Turkish coffee.",positive
Had my hair done by Joni tand he did a fantastic job. So I'm back for my touch up. Prices are great and well worth it. Love this place.,positive
Omg!!! I'm from out of town here in AZ for my step sons wedding. I looked up yelp and read that hair by Joni was great! I was treated with the best hospitality and professional curtesy!! I would recommend this place for hair and makeup with 10 stars!!! Thank you thank!!!,positive
"Joni is simply the best hair stylist I have ever had do my hair. He is trained from around the world and it shows in his style recommendations and finished product. I have brought numerous friends in and they all love what he does whether it's hair, eyebrows, or whatever they come in for. I highly recommend hair by Joni to anyone who wants the best hair experience they have ever had.",positive
"ONE STOP SHOP LADIES! I came in expecting just a trim and a root touch up, and left with a fantastic full service! Joni is by far one of the best hair cutting experiences I have ever had. He took the time to discuss my hair and figure out exactly what I wanted and helped me see what I didn't even know I needed. He did a fantastic job on my color, and cut my hair to get me the exact look I had envisioned just by taking a quick look at a photo I showed him. While I waited for my color to sit, he made me a wonderful cappuccino and made sure I was ok and comfortable. In addition, he also hooked up my eyebrows with my first threading experience. Although I was apprehensive, Joni effortlessly re-shaped my brows and cleaned up my face. I will never bother with plucking or painful waxing again. I will definitely be back for all my salon needs!!On a side note, I have a follow up app. for a facial which I have no doubt will be awesome! A must go to salon, thanks Joni!",positive
"I came in with high expectations due to the high yelp ratings and I have to say they were met. Joni took his time and made sure my hair cut and eyebrows were everything I wanted. This is a family owned business that is very welcoming, I highly recommend this establishment.",positive
"My mom and I were traveling to Phoenix to visit family and we came across this salon based on local Yelp reviews - and we are so glad we listened! The entire experience was excellent - professional, top quality service. On top of transforming our hair (color, cut and highlight), the staff was friendly, took their time with our hair yet were very efficient, and all for very affordable prices. Joni even made us a homemade cappuccino which was better than any coffee shop we have tried in the area. We strongly recommend this place for anyone who wants top quality hair service!",positive
We were referred to Joni by a friend and have been going to him ever since. Perfect brows every time! I would definitely recommend him to anyone!,positive
Such great service from Joni. My boyfriend needed a hair cut badly but was nervous about his hair line. Joni was so helpful and made him so comfortable. Amazing cut and beard trim. We both highly recommend!,positive
"By far the best hair salon I have been to in the Valley! Joni, the guy who styled my hair last Saturday for my friends wedding did an amazing job. I have never had someone do my hair exactly how I want it and it stayed from 10 am till the end of the wedding which was 2 in the morning. Best experience ever and I will be going back not only for styling but to get a hair cut also. Thank you for taking your time and doing my hair exactly how I asked also for not rushing me.",positive
"I pass by this salon every day on my way to work - I finally called and I could kick myself for not calling sooner! Joni is so friendly as is his assistant Marilyn - he took the time to find out what I wanted and we talked about what he was going to do to make things happen. I've been in the process of growing out very short hair - my goal is to once again sport an A-Line Bob - It's going to take me a while to get there but I know my hair is in good hands. My color is beautiful and my cut is sleek! Marilyn happens to be learning and Joni had her help with the color so she could get experience - I LOVE that! They continually offered me coffee or water and just provided a warm, inviting atmosphere! I'm visiting the salon again at the end of October and am bringing 4 additional people with me! So happy to have found Joni - he is awesome!",positive
Joni is the best!! I trust him 100% with my hair! Great recommendations on color & trends!!! Best hair cut in town and bonus of eye brow threading expert!!!,positive
I walked into Joni's salon with severely damaged hair that was bleached twice and turned an orangish brownish color. He took the time and talked me through how to get my hair healthier. He colored and cut my hair back to its natural brown color. My hair is no longer damaged and back to its healthier hair. He is a professional that knows what he's doing. I will definitely be back.,positive
I came in today - I needed a major re-do on my hair. Joni and I spent some time reviewing what I was looking for. I'm mostly gray now and I wanted to remove all the bad old color from my hair and go back to as close to my original hair as possible - which is all salt and pepper now. I had waited a long time to come to the salon again - which allowed Joni to see a large section of my roots and we started from there. We removed all the old color we matched my roots and original color. I love my new hair and I gave Joni free style to cut my hair. He gave me a great new hair style and a perfect re-color/match to my roots. I'm so happy - even my husband was happy to see me back to my old self. It was so nice to be able to have a salon actually listen to what I wanted done - and actually spend the time to make sure it was right. Best stylist I have ever had. Thanks again Joni - You will be happy coming to this salon.,positive
"Hair by Joni is a great salon to go to, they do hair, nails, waxing, threading, ect. I have been coming here for a while now and have been pleased everytime. Being friends with Joni is great he's fun and professional!",positive
Joni does the best job with your eyebrows. He threads which I have a hard time of finding someone who is detailed enough but he does that perfect.,positive
"Joni is the owner and the stylist. He does bridal updos, make-up, bridal parties, proms, threading eyebrows, and the list goes on. I started going to him as a walk in to get my eyebrows done. From the moment I meet him he treated me like family, as I see him interact with his other clients he treats them the same. I leave it up to him when I go get my hair dyed and styled. He always delivers perfection. Every time I don't think he could do any better he always outdoes himself. He also has a nail tech, her name is Nicole. She is just like him. Her work and personality are impeccable. I hope you would take my advice and go to see him and/or I Nicole promise you will not be disappointed.",positive
"Debbie has been cutting my hair for the last 15 years...since I was in high school. I had so many bad hair cut experiences prior to finding Debbie. She has never once let me down. She always gives me a cut and highlights that are both flattering and very up to date with the newest styles. I am constantly being stopped, being asked where I get my hair cut. I live in Flagstaff (2 hours away) and she is so worth the drive. She knows my hair and my style and I trust her completely. If you bring in a picture of what you want, she is honest with you in whether or not your hair could pull that look off (taking into consideration thickness/thinness/texture, etc). Whatever look/cut you and her decide on, you can bet that she will deliver. She is a perfectionist and will make sure your haircut and color meets her high standards. She is also priced wonderfully for her level of expertise! She is very good at educating her clients on how to style their new hair cut so you know how to look fabulous every single day. I will continue to make the drive to see her and would highly recommend her to anyone!!",positive
"Mischa is AWESOME! She's done my hair several times so far and I will definitely keep coming back. I had never dyed my hair when I first came in and she made me really comfortable - it was easy to trust her. I got my bright red at first, and then this last time most recently she lightened it up for me so now I have a more natural strawberry blonde, and I just love how the color came out. Her personality is great, so plan to have fun throughout the entire experience - I highly recommend visiting her for all your cut/color/styling needs!",positive
"Mischa is simply the best of the best.. She was able to get the jet black hair dye out of my hair, and help me go lighter with blonde streaks.. Not only is she amazing at what she does, her customer service is immaculate... She has such a bubbly personality, and is such a positive individual, which helps a lot, considering customer service now a days seems to not be a big factor with some businesses, that will not be the case with Mischa and i highly recommend her to all. I am so happy that i FINALLY found my new hair stylist.",positive
"Mischa made this a fun experience. We laughed and talked for hours! My hair takes long to do but being with her I lost track of time. My hair is fluffy and thick which most hair stylist can't take the frizz away but Mischa did! Not to mention I got s keratin treatment and just love my hair! Thank Mischa for the new cut, color and feel! I will see you again that's for sure!",positive
"Mischa made my first time hair makeover experience absolutely pleasant full. We laughed most of the time I was there. She totally exceeded my expectations, I will definitely be a returning client. Over all, great customer service, very professional, and extremely talented. Thank you Mischa!!!",positive
"Mischa did what I asked her to do, and I've never had this experience before! She listened to exactly what I wanted and she did it! She had me laughing the entire time with her lil ""ball of spunk"" personality. I will be a new regular client!",positive
"Mischa is fantastic!! I really enjoyed my visit with her today. I trusted her right off the bat to do whatever she wanted with my hair and she did not disappoint. I love the organic color she choose as well as my cut. All her products are top notch and my hair looks so much better. I feel great!! It's not easy finding a stylist that you click with and does a wonderful job. I'm so glad I met Mischa. I'll be referring people to her and plan to return as well. Don't hesitate, book an appointment today!! :)",positive
Mischa is amazing!great customer service and my hair came out beautifully.i did a cut and all over color and im so happy with the healthy bounce and shape of my cut as well as the beautiful organic color she did.her prices are very good considering we are in old town Scottsdale and she took her time and made sure my experience was comfortable and pleasant .I will be returning for many more hair appointments!she uses great top notch products like paul mitchell and organic hair dye most places in scottsdale dont do as great of a job and charge an arm and a leg.i highly recommend seeing mischa for all your hair needs,positive
Mischa is an awesome style. Very attentive to details and listens to your needs. Thank you so much for the color and cut. I love it and I highly recommend Mischa is you're looking for a new stylist. She rocks,positive
"Awesome experience, best hair wash this side of town. Mischa did a fabulous job making me dapper....I highly recommend her for all your hair needs.",positive
"Mischa is a fabulous stylist. She gives a great shampoo and a fabulous haircut. She is hilarious,easy to talk to and a great listener. I also love the Paul Mitchell Awapui Shampoo and conditioner she uses! It leaves my hair feeling great and smells wonderful! I highly recommend! I always feel great after my visit with Mischa!!",positive
"Mischa has been doing my hair for several years. I like the vibrant reds with low lights and she does a perfect job! She is creative, great with make-up and fun to talk to.",positive
I always look forward to my appt with Mary Ann...I love how she takes her time and picks the right colors for my hair&highlights!! I get such great compliments on the cut and color. And I love how she takes Sunday & Monday appts 7am-7pm),positive
"I am disappointed, I bought 2 Groupon services to have my hair cut, treated and styled by Maryann. I was looking forward because of the reviews. I called 4 times in a week and half leaving a message each time. I finally received a callback at 8:00 a.m. on a Saturday morning. I believe it was Maryann that called. She seemed confused and just said my name and then said ""I just had a cancellation at 9:00 a.m. on Monday"" and paused. I said I could not make that time, but before I could say anything else (I had another appointment) or ask for another time, Maryann said ""Ok and hung up"" I never received another call. Luckily I was able to get a refund from Groupon.",negative
MaryAnn is a fraud. Purchased a groupon and have been unable to receive services after nearly 6 weeks. She has canceled multiple appointments the am before and due to only working 2 days a week it takes weeks to get another appointment.,negative
I would not recommend Mary Ann! The first time she did my hair it was perfect! Second time - what was supposed to be a 11:00 am appointment turned out to be 4 pm since she did not write it down! Very disorganized. What should have been golden brown color turned out pitch black and the products used caused a lot of itching to the scalp! Disappointing experience overall!!!,negative
"The first time she did my hair she did a great job. However she took over 4 hours to do my color and cut. I was patient and sat basically in the same chair for the entire service. I'm glad that I had no other appts for that day since I wouldn't have been able to do anything else! She is a great colorist, but my advice to you if you are expecting a quicker stylist keep looking. Also, I had to cancel an appt and reschedule but she has not returned any calls so far. My guess is that she is just not at all flexible, so if you make an appt with her, no matter what don't cancel as she seems to simply blow you off at that point. Another thing, called her 2 weeks prior to my birthday to do what she offered as a free follow up color refresh and she got back to me too late to have her do my hair for the event planned on my birthday. I would call her a one hit wonder (except for the incredibly long time she takes getting your hair done.) So, to amend this review: she's now cancelled her appt with me a few hours before my appt, having waited 2 weeks for the second appt. The last appt we had she did not even show up. Honestly she may need to think about retiring at this point if she cannot keep her appts. Well now she has one less client to schedule....",negative
"Mary Ann is a true dedicated hair stylist. She will not be happy until you are happy. She spends the time to ask what kind of hairstyle you are looking for. Then searches with you through magazines until you find something close....a basic place to start. Not only did she repair a recent disastrous haircut but suggested toning down the high-lights in my hair. With Mary Ann knowing the basic hair style I was looking for, I felt confident enough to allow her to do whatever was necessary to achieve my goal. I know my hair needs to grow in some areas and be kept trimmed in others. I am a work in progress but for a first time around haircut and color, I couldn't be happier. Mary Ann is a gem and we are going to have a long, happy relationship. Oh, and I need to mention, Mary Ann charged half of what I was paying other stylists !!!",positive
"I would most likely given her 5 stars but was my first time, let's see how it grows out She absolutely listens to what you like, something I find hard to find in Las Vegas I will definitely go back",positive
"To be honest I usually go to my local Great Clips to get a haircut, but I saw Mary Ann's reviews and her Groupon deal that I couldn't pass it up. She is fiercely passionate about making you look like a movie star. I have NEVER had someone cut my hair with such genuine dedication. She accepts any challenge that is thrown at her, and she does so proudly. I was left speechless when she finished with my hair. My entire life I haven't been able to run my fingers through my hair since it's incredibly dry, and Mary Ann made my hair so soft and healthy looking. I'm obsessed with it. Never going anywhere else but to Mary Ann's!",positive
MaryAnn my hairdresser is amazing with her innate ability to make you look natural and elegant at the same time. She is also reasonably priced and is accommodating to your schedule. Definitely worth a trip here to see her.,positive
Mary Ann is such a sweetheart and very nice to work with! She will listen to what you want and will give suggestions. I am very satisfied with her work. So glad she didn't have to bleach my hair. I brought a picture of what color I wanted to achieve and I think that what she did to my hair is better than the picture! Super love it! I'll definitely recommend her to family and friends!,positive
"I found Mary Ann on Groupon and couldn't pass up the great deal she was offering! I came in with an idea of what I wanted but said I was open to suggestions. She ended up adding some violet into my hair and I love it! I'm really happy with the color, it looks natural indoors and bold in the sunlight which I love. She spent a lot of time with me and I really appreciate the great service. Even though her location is 40 minutes from my house I'll likely be returning! Thank you Mary Ann!",positive
Mary Ann knows what she's doing. I've been looking for a hairstylist for a while now. I believe I've finally found the one. Thanks Mary Ann. Look forward to seeing you soon!,positive
"Found Mary Ann back in March on Groupon, she is amazing and so sweet! She always takes the time to go over hair products, styles, and really take care of my hair. The color & highlights in my hair have never been so pretty. And the best part it's so healthy now!",positive
This charming lady is AMAZING!!! She never ceases to amaze me with her talent & just sheer kindness; I adore her! Give her a try; she is a talented woman with years of experience. I hope some of the cheap-o groupon customers start treating her right; she's a gem!,positive
"I bought this on groupon for $39. It was for hair color, highlights, cut and style. I booked appointment 6 weeks in advance. My appointment was for 3:00. I showed her a picture of the hair color I wanted. Light brown with blond high lights. My hair was currently a dark blonde. Mary Ann started coloring my hair. As she was coloring my hair, another client showed up for her appointment. She worked on us both back and forth. 3 hours later, she had rinsed the highlights from my hair and the other client was also rinsed and waiting for a hair cut. She had another client coming in at 6:30. I asked if I could come back another day for the cut. My hair color was not brown with blonde highlights as I requested, but red with blond highlights. Clearly working on both of us simultaneously was not getting me good results. She told me to come back the next day at 3:00 for the cut. I went home and washed my hair twice with hot water and applied a deep conditioner, trying to get some of the bright red out. Did the same thing the next day prior to my hair cut appointment. The next day my appointment was at 3:00. She was working on someone else when I arrived at 2:50. It was3:40 when I finally got in for the hair cut. Not happy with anything about this stylist.",negative
Love Mrs Mary Ann!!! She fixed my fuzzy and damage hair. Now my hair looks healthy and more manageable. She took her time to explain what kind of product I should use on my hair. My hair has change drastically. Her prices are within my budget. I definitely found my new stylist in Las Vegas.,positive
mayann must be one of the best colonist in town she has just done wonders with my hair and my family you can't go wrong with her outstanding talent and abilities. l highly recommend her for your hair needs.,positive
"I had my first appointment with Mary Ann today, and I cannot rave enough about how pleased I was with her service! Mary Ann comes from a hair styling family and grew up in the business. Speaking as a former hairstylist myself, I give her an A+ on talent, passion, and skill. I have lived in Las Vegas for over three years and have had to salon-hop trying to find someone who I felt comfortable and excited about returning to. I have found my colorist, stylist....and artist in Mary Ann. To add icing to the cake, get the Groupon deal....it's worth ten times the price you'll pay! So happy to have found you, Mary Ann... Glad I took a supply of your business cards, as I will be referring everyone to you. You're the BEST!!",positive
Love my new hair color-correction and hair cut from Mary Ann! She's easy to get along with and knows her stuff. What I liked best is she cares.... She's doesn't care about the money part of business but about you and your hair! Which is cool! I will be back!,positive
I found Mary Ann on groupons and so happy I did. I bough the groupon for my daughter and she gave her a nice cut. The day before I went to a another stylist that butchered me. When she saw my cut she said sit down and I will clean it up for free. She fixed it and I have found my lady. I have a short sassy cut and very light colored hair so it's hard to not look choppy. Mary Ann knows her hair!!!!,positive
I had a great time going with Mary Ann to get my hair cut. Not only that but she took the time to cut my hair and made sure it looked nice. Thank you so much! :),positive
Wow! Amazing. I found Mary Ann with a Groupon. She was the best priced groupon in my area and had appointments available not too far out. Let me tell you - never judge a book by its cover. Don't let her age fool you into judging the talents of this hair artist. She is sweet as can be and hair is her lifes passion. Her prices are more than reasonable and you will feel as though you should have paid 3x or more what you were charged. She has learned from the best - In conversation I found out she studied with a Bay Area renowned stylist that my mother used to hair model for. She truly cares about her clients and her work is spot on. I have grown my hair out from being shaved - it was boring and frumpy to me now. I asked her for something trendy & edgy and boy did she deliver. I LOVE the cut and the purple highlights she did are excellent. I will ALWAYS come see Mary Ann moving forward and refer all my friends. She truly is a master stylist and it was a blessing to have found her. Look no further - she's the REAL DEAL.,positive
I haven't gotten my hair done in a couple years so I wanted something bold and different. Mary Ann assured me I'd love my hair when she's done with it. She took careful consideration of the length and style that would go great with my skin tone and health of my hair. I say she was spot on. I love my new look. She's very pleasant and an all around wonderful person. Thank you Mary Ann you're great!!!,positive
"Today (01/18/15) my sister and I saw Mary Ann for the first time. She was absolutely wonderful! Her knowledge and expertise is astounding, and it's awesome that she continues to learn and keep herself knowledgeable about current trends and techniques. I went in looking for a single process color and just a trim, my sister went in with already short, black hair looking for a dramatic change. Amazingly, Mary Ann made this happen! She transformed my sister's tame pixie cut into an edgy, hot, and daring do! She added beautiful highlights that added depth and even accentuated my sister's eyes. The cut she did was just awesome. I barely have words to describe it. Somehow she gave depth and shape to a very short cut. She is not only experienced, but ensures that she keeps up her knowledge. Mary Ann not only has technique, but she takes her time to make sure each of her clients looks absolutely gorgeous. She does not rush, she wants each of her clients to feel humanized. I have psoriasis (mainly on my scalp) and she took a little extra time to spray an extra moisturizing and healing olive oil mix on it to help it heal. Also, the color mix she used didn't burn (like it normally does). It's amazing to find a hair dresser who genuinely loves what she does, so much so that she makes sure you LOVE you hair. My sister's cut was definitely complicated, and she took her time to make sure it looked PERFECT. My cut was not a complicated one, but she still made sure to take her time and make sure it looks amazing. She even threw some curls in my hair to bring out the color she just did. Not only is she an amazing hair dresser, but she is fun! We were there for quite a while as both colors had to sit, but she made the time fly by as we laughed and talked. We will definitely be planning our visits to her again, most likely on Sunday afternoons when we can take our time and really have a blast! I cannot stress enough how much I loved seeing her today and how much I hope to continue seeing her in the future. Two thumbs WAY WAY up!!! :)",positive
"Frustrated with your hair? Meet a true professional that gives awesome hair cuts and styling at a great and fair price for men and women. I met Mary Ann when she arrived in Las Vegas and worked at Spirals, in Sun City Summerlin, then followed her to the new location at Simmons and Ann Road in North Las Vegas. She is worth the short drive, again for the expertise and the bang for your buck! Spread the word - Mary Ann is awesome! Steve VanSickler Lone Mountain & Durango Las Vegas, NV",positive
"Liana always does an amazing job on my hair. She is a colorist queen! My cuts are always amazing too. She really cares about keeping hair healthy and adds additional conditioners and such to help prevent damage from coloring. She always takes her time to make sure everything is as I want it. She also sells gift certificates which are always a lovely gift idea. I recommend giving the gift of a gift certificate! Always a pleasure to go there and get a cut, color and brow/lip waxing! The salon is beautiful! I highly recommend her!",positive
"I cannot say enough about Liana and her expertise! She took her time and truly wanted to know my desire for my hair. I've never had a stylist so knowledgeable and explained every part of the process. She loves her craft and it shows in the outcome! She cares about the health of your hair and genuinely about you, as a person! You will not regret sitting in Liana's chair. Plus, the place is beautifully decorated and very comfortable!",positive
"Liana is amazing she is one of the best hairdresser's I've ever been to, she took her time and really wanted to know what I wanted, she was so friendly and personable I will recommend her to everyone,I love my color and my cut, she is truly a gift from God.",positive
"I went to see Liana while I was on vacation in Las Vegas as my local hair dresser was on maternity leave and I wanted my hair to look good for my birthday, so I figured I'd get everything done in one shot: haircut, highlights, and blow out. Obviously it was sort of a gamble but I'm glad I took the risk. Liana is great -- she is super sweet, talented, and makes you feel comfortable during the whole appointment. I'm a pretty easy-going client and went with the usual, ""Do what you think looks good!"" but she wouldn't let me get away with it. She was very invested in making sure I got exactly what I wanted. I ended up asking for intense blonde highlights and it's exactly what i got. Super happy with the results and only wish I lived locally so I could see her all the time!",positive
"I went to liana recently after meeting her at the woman's expo at the Cashman center, was a little afraid because my hair has been damaged before by other stylist, however, I absolutely love my hair. She did color and cut and my hair came out AMAZING! Totally love it and she was super friendly. The price was fair and affordable. Would definitely recommend her to my friends.",positive
"BEST RESULTS EVER! PERFECT JOB! Liana was great so full of energy. I came here to get a root touch up on my platinum blonde hair. For those of you who don't know it's a very hard color to work with. I've been platinum blonde for over 7 years and this is the best stylist I've ever been to. She actually cared about my hair and making it look the best it's ever looked. She was full of knowledge and shared with me every step she was taking with my hair process. Liana even sent me home with an amazing product to keep my hair healthy. I'm from out of town and I found this salon/stylist through Groupon. I didn't use a Groupon cause she gave me a great rate on my service with 10% off for being a new customer. The salon is so chic and beautifully decorated. Black and white so many details went into the remodeling of this place. Highly recommend trying this place out. Great for color, cuts or just a special night out blow dry/style.",positive
This is an awesome place! The ladies there are very knowledgeable about the product. Thanks for helping me make a the correct purchase.,positive
"I love this place! They have many options and what they don't have, they can order. Just make sure you have time if order is needed. Sometimes the extensions are made to order and take awhile. The girls here are so kind and informative. My new fav extension shop!",positive
"Ladies, if you wear extensions YOU MUST check this place out!!! First off, I'm a hairstylist that does extensions but I've also worn extensions on and off for 15+ years. I was a loyal client of another brand but about a year ago the quality of their hair went tragically down and the price went up. For months I've searched and used other brands only to be disappointed over and over again. I primarily work with blondes and the hair I found would tangle and shed within a couple washes. Horrible!! I found Hair Exotic and could not be happier!!! When I first went in they didn't carry a lot of lighter colors but after talking with the owner, Brenda, she was beyond accommodating and ordered all colors and lengths I use most often. By the way, they can order 31"" length!! Yesss!!! I now strictly use this company for all of my extension clients and wear it myself. I'm obsessed with the quality and the customer service! I highly recommend this place!!",positive
"Great shop! What can. I say.. Beautiful hair. I'm wearing it now, great prices and fantastic service! What more could you ask for... Run don't walk to this little gem!!",positive
"Wow finally a professional place i can purchase extensions, wigs, ans related products!! Not only are the owners knowledgeable about hair they seem to care about the products they sell. Great tips on how to care for your purchase. They take the hair buying experience to a hold other level. I purchased a bundle and had it trimmed to fit my face perfectly. The hair feels like silk and looks extremely natural. No more shiny plastic disposable hair for me.",positive
I was very interested in hair extensions and decided to visit this location since it is close by. Such a great experience. Brenda explained the difference of the hair and care of extensions and I was amazed at her patience and knowledge. Very happy here,positive
You get what you pay for. They do everything quickly and finish within 10 mins max. They don't really pay attention to lines or anything.,negative
"if youre looking for a simple buzz cut (that pretty much anyone can do), sure you can come here because it is cheap. but if you want to have a decent hairstyle, stay away from this place!!! By miles the worst place you can ever go to for a haircut. you come in, and you look at the hairstylists hairs, it should ring you a bell that there is something wrong with their abilities in style. I gave a second chance to try it, and I regret it so much. my hair doesn't look anywhere close to the picture I gave them, and looking more like trolls. right from the bat, she use a #1 (which I am not aware of), usually people go with #2 or 3 so that you don't cut too short. bam the next 5 seconds, you realize you're in trouble. No point of giving pictures because everyone seem to have a military buzz haircut. all I can say is that simply don't get fooled by the $8 sign because you will end up spending more money going to other hair salon. stay away from this place. Thanks hair king for ruining my Christmas.",negative
"After going to their peanut plaza location I wasn't satisfied because they didn't do my hair that well and didn't know what I wanted. They also hurried me and didn't make me feel welcome. But this location is completely different. All the stylists were friendly and the other patrons all looked quite happy. I showed the same pictures and and asked my stylist about it, and received personal advice as to which cut would look the best on me. Very friendly and encouraged me to take some time to make my decision, unlike the first Hair King I went to. As for the cut itself, she did an awesome job with it. I really hated flat hair but she gave me so many layers and volume to it. She also gave me advice on how to keep the style on my own. It was quick and cheap, and I will definitely consider going back in the future. For ladies (like myself) it costs $13 because our hair is longer.",positive
"Been going to Hair King for 4-5 years now since they opened and they're great. The wait time is usually very fast as they have 4 to 5 staff and all of them are consistent. This is a chinese salon that speaks minimum English, so be clear on what you want. The price is really cheap $8 and up cash only for a haircut. Definitely recommend this place.",positive
"a quick summary: - fast (no appointment needed, done in 15 min) - cheap ($8) - great result (on par with some $30+ haircut I had before)",positive
"I stopped by this place yesterday on a whim. I've seen it many times passing by, and I always wondered if it was any good. I walked in, and was greeted by the stylist right away. It was quite empty actually. She seated me, and asked me what I wanted done. I gave her my regular instructions. She did my hair wonderfully. It was a better cut than I've gotten at many other places (First Choice, Magicuts, Great Clips etc) While she was doing my hair, about three other customers came in and were seated right away. Stylists came out of the back like clowns coming out a car. It was awesome. I'm very picky, and I like to direct the stylist when they're doing my hair, and she didn't seem offended at all. I really like what she's done with my hair, and I will definitely be going back. Also, the cut was only 8 dollars. Thats right. 8. No tax, nothing. I tipped her 50 percent for that awesome job she did. They also have a deal for 30 dollars, cut and colour for men. I might be back for that! :) Oh, and it's cash only.",positive
"Hair Pollution is amazing. But first, can we talk about this person Savannah's ""review"" discussing the Ollie Vaughn parking brouhaha, for a moment? This is a person who is outraged that she isn't allowed to park in spaces reserved for Hair Pollution's customers when she is going to an entirely different business. She feels that Hair Pollution is being mean by trying to ensure parking for their customers, and not allowing other people to park there. The cruelty of it all. If you are swayed by people like this, then I can't help you. Entitled spoiled people who do not understand basic reality often write reviews that slander a small business because they feel personally wronged. It's not new. It's the vindictive nature of forums like these. In reality, the stylists at Hair Pollution are talented and hard working people who value their customers and as a result, simply want the three or four spaces reserved for their clients to be available for them. Not for a person patronizing another store, because she feels entitled to do what she wants. And if you choose to park there when you know it's reserved and that the consequences could be towing, it doesn't make you a victim. It makes you a jerk.",positive
"Love this place, always plenty of parking spaces, and Tad is Amazing!!! This place is the coolest salon in the valley, by far.",positive
I love every minute at hair pollution! Where everyone rocks and wierdness is encouraged! If having white girl dreads wasn't hard enough I wanted to go purple! Jaelen is a talented stylist who always delivers what I want while still being real with me so my hair stays healthy! I cant go kn about them enough they rock everything from purple dreads to the conventional cut and color. If you havent ben in yet you're missing out!,positive
"Hair pollution is the best! I was always a ""serial"" hair dater (I would find a new stylist and go to them for 3 or 4 times and then switch salons, I was never super impressed). Until I found hair pollution. I live in north scottsdale and would gladly go way out of my way to go to this fun and funky salon. Everyone is fantastic! Casual urban chic that caters to an eclectic crowd. I love love love this place. Tad is amazing from extensions to cuts truly exceptional. Jaelen is outstanding as well! She is a class act and would trust her 200%! Cuts are amazing. I have finally made a commitment to the hair pollution team :)! I have been going to them for about a year and half and will continue.",positive
"When I first found Hair Pollution, I was desperately trying to get fit in somewhere around the holidays. I am terrible at making hair appointments in advance, I know this about myself and I have accepted it. I was getting denied over and over, until I called Hair Pollution. They understood my problem and accommodated me, as long as I could get in there within the next 15 minutes. And away I went....flying into an area of downtown Phx that I don't usually visit. I have to admit, upon arriving in the parking lot, I was a little skeptical. BUT....this is the CHARM of Hair Pollution. I met with Jaelen and we immediately hit it off. Her haircut and color were EXACTLY what I needed and I felt like her prices were very fair and reasonable. (In my opinion, its crazy what some stylists charge for a haircut.) I visited her again around April and again, was impressed with her talent and skill. She truly is a hidden gem in the Valley world of stylists. She makes you feel cozy and comfy in her chair, a skill that many hair stylists lack. Hair Pollution is funky, fun, unique, crazy, and a bit over the top....but you never, ever run out of things to look at. Its like a candy store for the eyes! Oh, and they have an amazing product line called EVO, which I never heard of before coming here. Easy Tiger is amazing! I know they are involved with the community as well, and that is impressive for a salon. I will be back for sure!!!!",positive
"This place is an amazing gem - starting with the awesome interior, was covered with funky murals and art but an upscale feel. They offered me water (an essential when living in Phoenix!) or coffee or soda as soon as I came in. Prior to my cut had the most relaxing shampoo EVER complete with head, neck and shoulder massage. (Whatever shampoo he was using smelled like peppermint oil... more cooling off effects!) Cut was exactly what I wanted - something a bit edgy - and far less than expected. (Got a men's style haircut, so it was all of $35. What?? So fantastic.) Absolutely recommend!",positive
"I love this place! Everyone is super friendly! Tad (Owner) is Awesome, and is very active in the community as well! These people do some amazing work! I would definitely let Jaelen cut my hair anytime!!!",positive
Great haircut and color. Chill atmosphere. I was able to make an appointment last minute and still get in! The staff is especially friendly with one gentleman going out of his way to make iced tea for me. Ask for Nate. I love what he did with my hair!,positive
"I LOVE this place! When you first walk in, don't be intimidated by the funky punk vibe... you don't have to be super cool or hipster to come here! Everyone is so sweet and non-judgy. I have been to see both Tad and Nate, and they are both awesome. They really listen to what you want, and don't cut corners. My cut and highlights always look perfect. Every time I walk out I feel fabulous! People constantly ask me where I get my hair done, and I am happy to refer them to Hair Pollution. Even though I live in downtown Scottsdale, it's definitely worth the drive to Phoenix for this place.",positive
"Two words: GINGER LUKE. I have followed this lovely lady for a few years now... from really corporate ""salons,"" through house calls, and now to the amazing Hair Pollution. It took me years to trust anyone with my hair enough to say ""just do whatever you think will look best."" and she nails it EVERY TIME. Though this has been true through all of her places of employment, I can tell she is in her element at Hair Pollution. This salon is a really beautiful establishment. Perfect tribute to all that is modern and cool with that perfect touch of vintage. This is no Regis or Great Clips. This is a salon of artists. Though Ginger is my go-to stylist, by the processes and end results I have witnessed, I can tell the other stylists are equally as talented and true to their original styles/techniques. Highly suggested.",positive
"Shaunz hooked it up like no one else. I was in town for a family affair and needed a trim. I wasn't quite sure what I was looking for but I knew I needed a new style, the whole Into The Wild look was getting old. After talking for a bit and showing me some hip men's styles he finally convinced me to take a chance and go for something new. What can I say? It was one of the best cuts I've ever gotten and he couldn't have been a nicer dude, so down to earth and hilarious! If I'm ever back in town I'll be stopping in to see him again, maybe even get a little date...eh? EH?!",positive
"i hadn't had a haircut in over a year- my ends were ridiculously dead and i had to basically pull out my hair every day when brushing it. i went to ginger for a cut and brows- i've been growing my hair out for over two years and wanted to keep as much length as possible and also wanted something simple since i don't own a hair dryer and have no desire to try and style it. she ended up cutting a little over an inch off and it looks and feels AMAZING! she checked with me through out every part of the cut and just put little layers in it and cut it dry, which i really prefer. i never felt pressure to buy product but ended up doing so since what she used was so awesome. now onto my brows- i tend to overdo my brows and have tweezed and waxed them to death. ginger did an awesome job and explained exactly what she was using and showed me them before she did anything further. overall, i am a HUGE fan- well worth the money and will be returning for regular cuts and brows!",positive
I got my hair hacked at another salon and was in desperate need for hair repair. I was working late on a Saturday and Hair Pollution was the only salon I could find that stayed open after 6pm. I called to book an appointment and they booked me with Amber. The hair salon isn't in the best neighborhood but I wasn't scared for my well being. The interior design inside is really funky and reminded me of something you would find in LA. Amber listened to my story about the bad experience I had at another salon and assured me she could fix the damage. She started off by washing my hair and gave me the best head massage ever! After that we discussed how I style my hair and what I'm looking for. I am very happy with my new do and I'll be back to see Amber. She rocks!,positive
"I have lived in such style capitals as Paris, London, LA and NYC. Never have I been asked to give my credit card over the phone to reserve an appointment or come in ahead of time to put a cash deposit down. Ridiculous! I understand that no-shows are a problem for many salons but this is the quickest way to alienate potential clients.",negative
"Too bad, close by and after reading other reviews just called and tried to book an appointment and couldn't. Not a big fan of giving out my name, phone number, and credit card to someone I've never met or a place I've never been...",negative
"Since I just moved to the valley from Chicago, I wasn't sure where to go. I made sure I checked out the reviews on Yelp before I would trust any salon to touch my hair. None of the salons in my neighborhood had good reviews, so I expanded my search. Hair Pollution popped up on my search and had awesome reviews so I figured I'd give it a shot. I came in as a walk in today for a partial high light and was able to be seen. Danae did an amazing job. My hair looks and feels amazing! The place is definitely interesting on the inside. Not your typical spa-feel salon, it totally works! Reasonably priced and great work will make me a returning customer!",positive
"Tad and his staff are amazing. A friend convinced me to finally try Hair Pollution after she continually came to work with gorgeous and creative styles. I had recently had hair trauma so was very leery of anything at all. After 8 months of not allowing anyone to touch my hair I followed her in. I am so so Soooo glad I did. Tad knew exactly what had gone wrong in my previous cut and color, how to remedy it and I left feeling and looking like a million bucks. I have never had so much fun at a salon either. The scalp massage alone was worth going. I also found the price for services incredibly fair. I cannot wait to go back!!! Faith in humanity restored. ;)",positive
"I've been back to see Samantha again and the compliments about my hair have not let up. She's friendly, fast and great conversation. Oh yeah, she does a great job cutting hair too. I love this salon with its funky vibe and cool art. Make a point of checking it out if you are fortunate enough to live in CenPho.",positive
"Samantha is great! I just moved here from Portland and was really sad to leave my awesome stylist there. But Samantha definitely rose to the expectations that my Portland stylist had spoiled me with. And the added bonus was, some dude honked at me on the way home, and basically said, your hair looks amazing.Yup, crazy stuff like that happens sometimes! Thanks Samantha for a great cut!",positive
"I decided to try this place because I attended a fashion show where this salon donated their services. I was so impressed with the quality of hairstyles I had to check it out. This is my favorite salon in the Valley. It's got such a fun and friendly vibe. I have been there several times and tried several stylists. Every single one of them was fantastic, friendly, and willing to show me different ways of styling. The shampoo experience is reason enough to come here. They massage your head forever! :) I actually fell asleep once. They take their time cutting and don't rush me out every time. I usually go in never knowing what I want and LOVE every haircut I get there. It's always something different and modern. I've been to places like Dolce where the stylist couldn't wait for me to leave as soon as I arrived, was unfriendly, and gave me a basic cut that looked straight out of 1998. This place doesn't disappoint. Give a try, it will be worth it. The prices are comparable to other salons, their cuts are a bit cheaper than what I've seen at other salons too. Love it!",positive
"This place is the best, hands down... I give much LOVE and respect for Tad the owner, he cuts hair like no one else i know in the world..His hands move in a way so fast you cannot even see thim, Tad scissorhands of the business! I used to work for him, when the place was by the library back in the day.. He was sweet, caring, amazing, and taught me a lot... He runs a business like he would love his family, deeply.. All the other ppl i worked with were sweet an warm as well.. I say go, an tell ALL your friends, your hair will love you, everyone will wanna be you and you will feel sexy as hell... Plus it is a fun place to be, lots to look at...My kinda place hands down..",positive
"Best hair color and cut I have ever had. Samantha is fantastic. I've never had red highlights that I've loved, but these were it. And I went in there with very vague ideas of what I wanted done, and she went with them and did a great job. The ambiance is awesome too - always neat artwork on the walls and interesting music. Prices are reasonable, too.",positive
I took my teenage daughter for a haircut today at Hair Pollution. She is thrilled with her cut and could not have been happier. WayCool aka Hair Pollution is an awesome shop. We researched other salons before choosing this one and I am so glad we went there. So many salons are about promoting themselves and who and what they know. This salon is about getting the job done without all the fluff. Chris did an amazing job and took a ton of time perfecting her cut. The salon has a cool artsy vibe that doesn't usually exist in Phoenix. We will definitely return again in the future.,positive
"Ive gone to WayCool for years now for mulitple reasons whether its a getting my hair done for a photoshoot or for my own personal cut. CHRIS always cuts my hair beautifully. Last time I went in, I didnt have a precise idea what I was going to do with my long red locks. My hair was so long, I had to make a change, and cut at least 7 inches off. I was so worried because of past experiences Ive had with other salons. Chris saved the day not only getting me to cut all the 7 inches, which I knew I had to but definitely didnt want, and combined my style with what would actually work with my face shape. Everyone loved it just as much as I did. Even when he styles my hair for photoshoots, his creativity never ceases to amaze me. Along with Darci as well.... Ive only worked with her once for a shoot but she did a wonderful job. Needless to say, everyone at WayCool know exactly what theyre doing with this great alternative feel that Phoenix doesnt have in salons anywhere. OH! AND THANK YOU FOR GOING BUMBLE&BUMBLE on us. BEST DECISION YOU GUYS MADE!",positive
"I never really like getting my hair done by strangers, but it turned out I was going to the wrong places. Way Cool Hair Pollution is a really fun salon that has a hip and arty ambiance without being snobby. The stylists are meticulous and know what they are doing. The first time I went, my sister who has been a hair stylist for years tagged along, and even she said she was impressed by the result and the process. I've had appointments with Julia and Darcy, and they both did a really great job on the cut. I was a little more pleased with how Darcy was able to style my hair which is curly underneath and straight on top. She did these little twists between her fingers and then used the diffuser to dry. It was the first time I didn't step out of a salon with either straightened hair (I never straighten my hair), or 1980s crunchy curls. The curls were perfectly formed but still looked natural, and it's something I can easily emulate at home. I will definitely be coming back and have already recommended it to a friend who also loved it. The prices are semi-reasonable. I've paid the same at places like Ulta and JCPenney salon and the results aren't half as good.",positive
"I've finally found a stylist that fits me! Darci! She's very friendly, unpretentious, and laid back. More importantly, she was able to give me the cut I wanted. My previous stylist got close, but my cuts just didn't have the finishing touches that I wanted. Darci was able to pick up on those, though. She did a great job working with my fine, limp hair.",positive
"Anyone who knows anything about me knows that I could very well be the most picky person when it comes to my hair and who cuts it!!! I discovered this salon, and Chris Phillips purely by accident one day when I decided to accompany a friend to her hair appt. I was a few weeks away from a scheduled hair appt with someone else but asked for an impromptu trim up to get me through. It was then that I met Chris. He gave me what a I'll call a mini-hair shape up but he did such a fabulous job, that I ended up cancelling my appointment with my regular stylist. I just had my first full cut and color appointment with Chris and he is a brilliant stylist!!! Both the cut and color are right on--he did a beautiful job!! My hair is short and fine.....and I can never find someone who can really texturize my hair the way I like it! I'm waking up every day now with a smile, having good hair days!!!! Chris and Way Cool get my highest praise!! :) I plan to be his newest loyal client!!",positive
Best salon in Arizona. I've been going there three years and counting. They always have the best stylist hard at work (specifically Stephanie and Samatha). These are some of the coolest people you'll meet. The owner Tad is the man and also a great stylist. Hair Pollution is by far one of the most unique and artistic establishments I've ever seen. Thumbs up from me! -@!,positive
"Well, I was going to give Megan a rave review, but I see someone else has already done it for me! She did a great job - I am really pumped about my hair now. She was also really easy to talk to. :) The salon itself is a really cool space. They had a DJ there - Megan said they always do on Saturdays. I think I've found my salon. :)",positive
"I was in Phoenix on a never ending business trip that forced me to cancel my hair appointment with my usual Boston stylist. Well after perusing Yelp to find a salon that could fit both of my requirements, funky interior and stylists with tattoos, I came upon Hair Pollution. I called and got an appointment with Megan the same day. She turned out to be really nice, easy going, and the best stylist I have ever had. Once I got back home everyone was complimenting my hair even my sister who never hides her disdain of my short dew. And since I am completely vain, my next business trip to Phoenix is going to have to take place when I need another hair cut.",positive
Best eyelash extension experience I've ever had here in Vegas! Yui is a pro and super gentle throughout the whole thing so much that I had the best nap I've had in a while. To wake up refreshed after a hard hot day at work freshly lashed by Yui's flawless work was the best feeling ever! I would definitely recommend her to anyone.,positive
"I highly recommend this place. I got eye lush here. It was awesome and really pretty. Yui, She's gonna explain everything so even if you're first time to do it, there is no worry.",positive
Got my hair done by Yota and I love it. He is gentle on the hair and really takes his time to make sure he has all the details right.,positive
Really nice place. I have been looking for right place to get my hair done for long time. I think I finally find the one. I just got my cut and color done. I'm really happy with result Nice Japanese and Korean stylist. Highly recommend. Everyone is really nice and friendly. I'm sure I'll be back. And next time I'll try their eyelash extensions that my friend recommended at same place,positive
"I'm so glad to found the best eyelash place in vegas finally. This is the best go to place for lashes. It was my first time here, all the staffs are so kind and helpful. They sent me some notices before I get there, and it was so helpful as well. Yui-my lash artist-was so nice, careful and friendly. They do have many detail options(length, curl, shape, and style), so the lashes are fit so well for my eyes. It looks flawless, and I can't feel any inconvenience by getting extensions. It's super light and natural. During the procedure, I felt so comfortable and even I can tell she's caring me a lot. By the time I left the shop, all the staffs were very attentive. I would DEFINITELY come back here again!!!!!!!",positive
"It was my first time at ViVi. So I was little bit nervous But My artist yui she was very nice and friendly, great customer service she explained everything I need. Made me very comfortable and relax. And she did great job!! I absolutely love my lashes! I definitely recommend this place!",positive
It was my second time to visit Vivi and this place is my favorite hair cut & eyelash place in Las Vegas so far. I enjoyed the amazing service by Yota and Yui. Customer service there was absolutely fantastic. I would definitely like to come back again :),positive
I had a great experience at Vivi! I got my eyelashes done by Yui. She explained everything in great detail and took her time to understand my needs. They use great products and are very professional.

"I found Shelly doing a research of best colorists in Las vegas, I was able to check out her pictures and Love her coloring jobs,She really listened and talked to me threw the steps she was doing. I brought in a picture of how I wanted my hair and she gave me what I wanted! I will be returning to her from now on!",positive
"Shelley is amazing she did the brazillian keratin straightening on my hair, and it came out awesome I love my hair. The treatment left my hair silky smooth and smells so good. I found Shelley on a Craigslist ad and I haven't been to a salon in 11 years, she is such a great person. She is a people person and very good to talk to. She loves her job, and I must say her work speaks for itself. I know who I will be going to and that's Shelley. If you are looking for an amazing stylist she is it. Thank you so much Shelley, it was so great to have met you. I will be seeing you in 3months. Love Dee",positive
"I found Shelley on groupon and have stuck with her since! Brazilian blowout, haircuts, and a Beachy wave perm all done perfectly! I love how good of a listener she is and she is a true perfectionist - a great quality in a stylist! She's spunky and fun so the time flies! Def recommend!",positive
"Shelley is an outstanding stylist. For the past two years, she has cut, colored and highlighted my hair. I have always been delighted with her work and receive many compliments on my cut and color. She listens to what you want and always makes appropriate recommendations. She is creative and gives expert suggestions for hair color that works with your skin tone, etc., and haircuts that fit your lifestyle. Shelley has a great sense of humor and we always share a few laughs together. Make an appointment to see Shelley--you won't be disappointed.",positive
"I am so upset. I got to my appointment 10 early. There was no receptionist at the front. Five minutes later both receptionists come out, say Hello and offer me a coffee (i declined). At no time did they notify my stylist that I was waiting. Instead I got to overhear their gossip about how the salon should be under investigation. After 10 minutes of waiting, I said that maybe I should change my appointment because they obviously over booked my stylist. The one receptionist said, ""no she doesn't wear her pager, we knew she'd be upfront."". That's when I got upset. I was about to walk out the door and the chatty gossip said, ""please don't leave"" and my stylist came out, apologized, and paid for my appointment. Do not go there unless you are in desperate need of gossip, and in desperate need of being ignored. I was a loyal customer for 2 years, and have never been treated like I was invisible.",negative
Don't bother going here unless you want to encounter extremely unprofessional workers and a rude manager to deal with if not satisfied.,negative
"Hop aboard the gossip train if you choose to go to Illusions ! The owner and several employees are completely phoney and unprofessional by gossiping behind PAYING customer's backs. No thank you, I left high school along time ago... choosing to take my $60 dollars elsewhere. All aboard !!!",negative
"Illusions is great. I have been twice while in the area and like the results. As a rule, I'm picky about my hair but I have yet to leave upset! They don't chop off 4 inches and claim it was just two, plus no surprises on prices. My only complaint would be that I always seem to be booked for a cut and style, even when I ask for just a cut and scheduled the latest possible time. The stylist always understands but it is frustrating to keep explaining ""just a cut.""",positive
"Drove past and saw this place, didn't have an appointment and they took me right before they closed. Got a hair cut by Nicole. Was more than pleasantly surprised. She did a great job. Cut off the perfect amount of hair for it to feel healthy again but still kept the length. We talked about color, and a funky cut, but she was very honest about what's best for my hair. (It was in pretty bad shape when I came in). The hair cut was perfect, but the honesty/conversation about how to get where I want with my hair is what will make me a consistent customer. Thanks Nicole!",positive
"Very nice staff. I haven't gotten a hair cut in a year and a half just because I never could find the guts to trust anyone with my hair. I finally went to illusion unlimited and got a hair cut from Marnie. She is just great,helpful and honest. She did exactly what I wanted to be done with my hair. I highly recommend her.",positive
"I love Illusions! I've been coming here for ~8 years now. For the past couple of years, Kelly has been my go to stylist. She always delivers! I get somewhat of a complex color, a deep purple tone. We moved out of state for a year, and between 4 stylists not a single one could compare to what she does! With all of my out of state stylists, I was paying almost double and my color would fade within a week. My color with Kelly lasts for ages and always looks spectacular, I get compliments on it all the time even when it's faded out. I'd highly recommend her, but you can't go wrong with any of the ladies here and if I was in a tight pinch there's several back up ladies who I'd trust as well.",positive
"It's really amazing what a single salon visit can do to improve your appearance. My visit was worth every penny. A woman named Sharron gave me an eyebrow wax and did an AMAZING job and actually put forth a lot of effort to get them perfect--no one else I've had did them with that much attention to detail. My haircut was fairly quick, but it worked wonders and I'm glad I got it. Hair looks much healthier now.",positive
"Nice decor, great selection of products, an array of stylists. I love Kara! She's so personable and you feel at ease with her. Wonderful hospitality is offered to all.",positive
"My sister set up an appointment here for her wedding with the bridal party. We arrived around 8am and the staff was friendly and accommodating with a nice cup of coffee. Honestly, I was kind of in crabby mood that morning, because I had no idea what to with my hair or if anything really formal could be done with it. My hair wasn't long enough, at chin length for an up-do like everyone else. After some brainstorming, my stylist began putting bigger curls in my hair and playing around with different options. Unfortunately, I can't remember my stylist name, but after some time she came up with an AWESOME style. I felt very vava-voom Elizabeth Taylor circa 1960's. They were even able to fit me in last minute to get my make up done too. I was so happy with how everything turned out, I truly felt like a rock star when I left. I got so many compliments at the wedding and it's all due to the great staff here!",positive
"I LOVE this hair!!! Not only is the hair amazing, Kallie was a joy to work with. I was so indecisive but she was patient and took her time explaining the various types of hair (no matter how many times I asked the same questions). I have purchased hair from various places throughout Charlotte, but the quality of hair and professionalism of this establishment is top notch. Now that I've found this spot, I will never buy hair from anywhere else!",positive
I have gotten a few pieces from Indique and I absolutely LOVE it every time ! The hair is consistent and the customer service is immaculate!!! I love the girls in there ! Very knowledgeable about their products !! I'd definitely recommend this company to anyone who's looking for great quality hair !,positive
"I have purchased hair at Indique twice now and have not been let down either time. The hair is amazing quality and can be used multiple times. It even better than the hair, is the service that Indique Charlotte provides. Callie is a super friendly, very knowledgeable and helpful consultant. After our first purchase, she checked in to make sure our purchase was holding up to our expectations. Prior to our second purchase, I called Callie and told her when we were coming and what we were looking for. When we arrived at the store, she had pulled everything we needed to see and ready for us to look at. Her service and kind demeanor is beyond appreciated. We will continue to come back to Indique!",positive
"I love this hair, I have been introduced to this hair at a young age and was convinced that this is the only hair I should be getting because it's long lasting and you will get what you pay for. Kallie is the best associate, she's very knowledgeable about the hair and how you should take care of it",positive
I have known about Indique hair for a long time. I finally came into the local boutique to purchase hair for my next install. I had a great experience and Kallie was extremely helpful and knowledgeable. Looking forward to getting this hair installed.,positive
"Ok first, the receptionist was on her phone and sitting with her feet up when I came in. Didn't greet me until I stared at her for a good minute at the desk. Got signed in and waited for 20 minutes with nobody in line. Don't come here for mani/pedi, as the students are more trained with hairstyling even though they provide different services like facials, mani/pedi/, waxing etc... I got a great shampoo, deep condition, haircut and blow dry from Felis for $12! She took her time and was really personable. The mani/pedi package wasn't as great because you sit in this awkward tile stage and the student sits uncomfortably on a stool. They also aren't trained with using tools that dig into your toes like other nail salons so my feet don't feel as clean. I come home and the nail polish had already chipped, I could've done it myself. You get what you paid for I guess. They lost 2 stars because of customer service and their lame nail salon set up! Tsk tsk!",negative
"OMG! I am soooo happy I found this beauty school. I have gone to many beauty schools but this one is THE BEST. Why you may ask? Well first off, the prices are unbeatable. You won't find cheaper at any other school-PROMISE. Second, it looks like a beautiful salon inside. You cant tell that it is even a school. Beautiful inside. Third, the student I had named Alanna gave me the best flat iron I have EVER had. That includes all professional services (and I am from Los Angeles-include them too). Wow. I was so impressed. I paid $13 for a shampoo and flat iron. Mind you my hair is down to my waist-no extra charge for long hair! I am SO happy I found this place. It is located in the Fiesta Mall which just adds to its greatness!!!! Go check it out!!! Their hours are great too! On Saturdays they are open until 5pm!",positive
"Had a manicure in the student clinic this morning. It is on the second floor of Fiesta Mall. It was only $7 for a basic manicure. The student did an excellent job and was very friendly. I was a walk-in, but they were able to take me right away. Two things kind of bothered me and kept this from being a 5 star experience: 1) One of the instructors was wearing hoop earrings the size of hula hoops and had a facial piercing. It just looked unprofessional and was the wrong image to model for her students. 2) On the floor, next to my feet, in the manicure area was a hair clip and few feet away was a clump of old hair. I know these are picky details, but it leaves the impression that faculty and students don't care about the details.",positive
"I probably get my hair cut like once a year because every time it's been disastrous but my visit here was very satisfactory!! All I wanted was long layers and angles and my stylist did just that. Was a bit nervous at first since it is a beauty school, but my hair turned out great! Shampoo, cut, and blowdry was only $7.50! Hell, I can't even get a burrito for that price.",positive
"I found this Beauty School on line. I looked up Beauty Schools in the neighborhood and this one came up. I called and made an appt. Three days later was my appt. Upstairs in Fiesta Mall. However, they had no record of my having an appt. But, just after a short wait I had a girl to do my hair. Samaria. She was a sweet girl who did a wonderful job on my hair. She was very careful and I was very pleased. Only $25.00,how could it get better than this! Good place to go to. The prices can't be beat. They even do mani pedi here as well. The parking is in the mall so there is a lot.",positive
"Kandice is amazing! I have super fine hair and came in with long, scraggly hair and told her to go darker (whatever she thought best) and do a blunt long bob cut. Absolutely amazing results. She's such a sweet person and made the whole experience an awesome one.",positive
"Was able to book my appointment the same week with Kandice and she did an amazing job. She inquired about what I wanted exactly and let me know my options during every the step of the process. I'm very picky when it comes to my hair, and she definitely took care of me. Highly recommend her.",positive
"I moved here 2 years ago from New York where I had lived all my life and being that I have had my hair done by the same person for 10 years was nervous about where I would get my hair done. My sister, a long time client of David's suggested I go to ISH. I have not been disappointed since! Everyone there is very competent and very nice. I myself started out with David doing my hair however one day could not get in with David and was offered to see Volila which I was happy to do. Volila is amazing at what she does, she takes her time and is precise. she goes over and above and takes her time to concentrate on who is in front of her. Besides, being good, I look forward to going into ISH to get my hair done becasue I can catch up with people who work there. Also, Hillary who is an esthetician at ISH is equally as amazing. I look forward to my appointments with Hillary just as much because not only is she knowledgeable but very very sweet. I would definitely recommend ISH to anyone needing a new salon.",positive
"I really wanted to like this place. I have used Yelp as a fairly credible resource in the past and this place had great reviews. New to the area, I came to Ish to get my hair cut and styled. The person I originally scheduled with had to cancel, but I went in and got a cut and style with another stylist. Shortly after, I returned to the salon because I was not satisfied with how the layers were falling in my long hair. I wanted them blended more. When I called to schedule the corrective cut, I was told that the owner could fit me in later in the week. I was very grateful. However, when I arrived, I was not in the books, but he did squeeze me in before his next appointment. We went over what needed amending and I felt heard. He was very friendly (so was the rest of the staff) and the atmosphere was pleasant. His next client came, however, and I could feel the urgency to finish with my cut/style. From here, I am honestly not sure what happened, but I left the salon with what is the worst haircut since my childhood. Though the layers were now blended in the back, a far worse problem was created. My front left side was SEVERELY uneven (see pictures). It's as if the scissors slipped and a huge chunk was cut out. When I saw my hair before I left, I was in shock and hopeful that it was just a wave/curl that was making things so uneven. I was extremely upset and could not bring myself to go in for a THIRD time. Ultimately, I had to find another salon (where I will go from now on) and pay full price for yet another haircut and style. Much to my despair, I have lost at least three and a half inches total off my length and paid for two haircuts. Again, though everyone was very nice, the final result and lack of professionalism are unacceptable. I am only writing this review with the hope that someone else can be spared from a mishap this large and costly.",negative
Everyone here is so friendly and they do amazing work! Candice is my personal favorite--she always has a smile on her face and she offers really helpful suggestions when I want to try different things. She never leads me astray! Would recommend to anyone of any age!,positive
Very classy place. I really like the way I am treated and the attention to details that Frank gives. I have been going here for over a year. Color match! Yes they get it right. Great for all ages young and old are welcome. They do not rush you though like the cheap hair cut places. One thing is I wish they were open in the evening... Appointments are necessary,positive
AMAZING!!!!!! I needed to have my hair fixed due to a previous attempt at some highlights. I am super picky about who does my hair and thought it couldn't get any worse. I called and spoke to Kandice and she suggested I come in for a consultation and then we can work from there. I came in and she said it wasn't as bad as she initially thought (I described something horrific on the phone) She said she could actually get me in right then. I think she could tell I was extremely nervous. She kept assuring me that she would not let me leave without being completely satisfied. She did more than deliver. She fixed my hair better then I could have expected. I absolutely love her and will definitely be a client of hers forever. The Salon was very upbeat and everyone seemed to be having a good time. Almost all of the stylists spoke to me in some way or another. When the owner left he personally thanked me for coming in and wished me a good night. It's very refreshing to go someplace new and have this great of an experience. Thank you Kandice for helping me and putting me at ease. I would highly recommend Kandice for your new stylist.,positive
"Frank did an amazing job! Love the cut and color is absolutely perfect! He listens, he counsels and he's very attentive to detail. My daughter was in town visiting recently and he gave her a great new color and style. I hightly recommend him!!",positive
"I was contacted by the new esthetician, Aurora, to come in & use the coupon that the front desk lady said I couldn't. After a bit of a wait she came & brought me back. Aurora was very friendly & did a thorough consult prior to my service. I decided on a body scrub/massage. She ended up treating me for well over an hour, gave me a mini facial & it felt great. She used the pressure I requested & checked on me throughout to make sure I was comfortable. The scrub felt & smelled amazing! The music & lighting was also great. I'd definitely recommend her!",positive
I went to ISH Salon after trying several other places in Phoenix and I couldn't be happier. TJ gave me an awesome haircut. He listened to what I wanted and made suggestions. It's the best haircut I have had in years. It's easy to take care of and looks great! Thank you so much!,positive
"Aurora is a mad genius. Look at my skin. Look at it! Enough said. Worth every penny, you won't want to go to anyone else",positive
"I love ISH!! Volila does my hair, and my mother taught hair in college so I'm hard to please, but she's AMAZING! I'm constantly getting compliments! The facial services are awesome too, Aurora is so knowledgeable!",positive
"Aurora is an amazing esthetician at Ish salon! I saw her for a collagen induction treatment and could not have been more impressed. She is kind, compassionate and enthusiastic about helping you reach your goals! one visit with Aurora and you will not only be relaxed, but have a new understanding for your skins condition. book an appointment with her today for an outstanding experience!!",positive
"I received the most amazing body treatment from AURORA! She is friendly, knowledgeable, and absolutely incredible!! She spends time with you and explains everything to where you can understand! I highly recommend her for massage, body treatments, and facials!! She is the absolute best! Thank you to Aurora for making me feel amazing!! Everyone call and book with her!! You won't regret it!!",positive
"Jo did my color and David did the cut. Both were awesome! I went from professionally colored red, to home color brown (twice to cover the red) and Jo was able to give me exactly what I wanted! She took her time and fixed my hair. David's cut was also great! I'm so glad to have found my forever hair home!",positive
"This place is like Cheers! After a couple of visits, everyone knows your name and it's like one, big, happy family! David has changed me from boring to stylish - very gently pointing me in the right direction and keeping me in my comfort zone. The color is brilliant and I am no longer stuck in the 90's. : ) Hilary is another gem - her facials do amazing things that you didn't even know you needed done. My skin feels fabulous after one of her treatments and it's a great break in this crazy life. Love this place!!",positive
I absolutely loved going to Ish salon! David made my hair beautiful and was so fun visiting with too! I live too far for regular visits but highly recommend Ish!,positive
Becky did a terrific color and trim for me. I love it! She seemed to sense what I like and was tactful with suggestions. I would trust her.,positive
"After years of going to different stylists I finally found David, who ""got it right"". He suggested coloring my hair, then highlighting over that, instead of just highlights which I had always had done. He also suggested a different cutting technique that brought out the best in my naturally wavey, thick hair. The result is a beautiful rich color with depth that looks natural, and a cut that I can style in a variety of ways with different tools, or just run my fingers through it in the morning and I'm good to go! I work in a public environment and EVERY day I get compliments on my hair. I highly recommend David to everyone.",positive
"Ryan has cut my hair for years and by far they are the best haircuts I have ever had! I never have to worry about what I'm going to get. Every time I go in everyone is so friendly and welcoming, I always have I great experience! I would recommend Ryan to anyone who wants to have the best haircut of their life.",positive
"Worst haircut ever. First time I liked the style, but cut was not even. Went second time and never again. Came home to fix my bad cut...she didn't even check lengths. One side way too long. Goodbye Ish. Wasted a lot of good money.",negative
Love Ish Salon! Jo is a wonderful stylist and colorist. She has colored and styled my hair for the past 4 years and my hair has never looked better. Thank you Jo and Ish Salon,positive
"Thank you Becky for your excellent service! My hair was long, dry and lifeless. A color and cut at Ish fixed it all and I'm one very happy new customer. Becky was friendly, professional and did a great job! The salon was spotless, inviting and relaxing. So happy to find this place!",positive
I wanted to write a review because I started my appointment off very anxious trying a new place. After about 10 minutes of talking to Jo Jo she definitely helped me feel more at ease right away. She listened to me and my concerns and took everything I said and applied it. Going super blonde is always scary but she did an amazing job! Thank you so much for taking the time and making my hair look great!,positive
"I love this place and the vibe. If you get a chance, book an appointment with Becky! I use to go to places where they'd over cut my hair in all of 5 minutes. Those days are over! Becky is incredibly friendly, talented, and amazing at what she does. Leave it to her to make you feel brand new whether it's cut, color, and/or style! I'm always leaving the place feeling beautiful!",positive
"I've been going to Ryan for about 7 months and I'm always very happy with his work. He's very nice, talented, and always makes me laugh! I referred 2 close friends of mine to Ryan, both of them absolutely love him, and became regular clients. As I cannot speak for any of the other stylist at ISH, I CAN tell you the staff has always been very nice and professional. Being relatively new to the area, I'm so happy to have found Ryan when I did, he's a pleasure to be around! Thank you :)",positive
"I am sorry I have not written a review before now. David is as good as it gets!! He is so accommodating, fun, and he knows his stuff!! Every time I go in he turns down the house music and makes me sing to his clients ( I'm not shy, so it's ok...lol) I always leave looking fabulous, feeling refreshed and still have money in my purse as Ish Salons is very affordable! Thank you Andrew, Frank, David and the rest of the staff for making me feel so comfortable and welcome!",positive
"I went to Ish salon to see Ryan for the first time about six months ago, when I walked in I noticed it was very clean, fun and had a very welcoming atmosphere. When I sat down I explained to Ryan how I have been having trouble finding a stylist that can meet my high expectations for both cut and color. After a brief consultation, Ryan then told me that he knew exactly what he was going to do and assured me that I was going to love it. Well, he was right!! Not only did he do an outstanding job with my color (that no one else could seem to master) he complimented it with an impeccable precision haircut (all for what I would consider a very fair price!) I left the salon feeling confident and couldn't wait for my next appointment. Ryan was very confident, genuine and comforting, explaining his history as a ""4th generation Hair Stylist"", he understood how nerve wracking it could be going to a new stylist for the 1st time. Ryan made it an overall wonderful experience. He dresses ""hip"" and and has a very colorful personality. I then sent my husband to him that very same week who gets a very technical fade and was tired of going to these cheep cost-cutters/sports clips places and having to walk around embarrassed for the next 3-4 weeks. Ryan did it again, he nailed it! My husband has never been so happy, explaining to me how well Ryan was able to fade his hair and flawlessly blend it into the top! Is there anything he can't do!? my husband is now a regular and so am I! 5 stars for Ish Salon and especially this very talented young man!",positive
I have known dave awhile and he is superb. He is a visionary on how to cut your hair. He listens and is great! This salon gets 5 stars.,positive
"Ish Salon in Ahwatukee is top notch! It's not very often you find an upscale salon that is still down to earth. I was intimidated when I walked in but it didn't take long for the front desk person to ask me if I needed anything. Very nice people here! But before I go on I would be remiss not to mention Frank! What a great guy! I received an awesome haircut at an affordable price. Not only is he talented but he is available. He will work extra hours to make sure his clients are taken care of. Call him! Oh and yes... the owner's son was the crazy guy on MTV's hit show ""Real World"" last season:)",positive
"I have been following Ursa, arguably the best stylist in town, for a while now. I am glad she has her own place. She is very talented especially with hair color and is meticulous. Never rushes you and always remembers your style and preferences.",positive
"Kate cut my hair. She was very polite and cut my hair just like I wanted, if not better. The salon is small, but it is nice and comfy. I've been looking for a place to cut my hair on campus for a long time and I found it.",positive
It's been 4 months since I came Champaign and I was looking for a salon. Jaivika salon is by far the best among the salons I have tried. Ursa is really nice and professional. It feels like she really knows what she is doing and that's the thing I was looking for. The price could seem a little bit high but it is definitely worth it. I highly recommend this salon for those who is looking for a better hair cut.,positive
"Jillanna has been my go-to stylist for years. She is amazing! I always leave with a cut I love. She's bleached my hair several times and I've never had breakage. She's dyed my hair blue, purple, and red for me, and I've always loved how it's turned out. The salon itself is small but clean and comfy, and its close to campus. I will be going to Jillanna for my styling as long as I live in the area!",positive
"After searching for a over a year for a salon and stylist, I finally found Jaivika Salon and Jillana! I love that the dye is ammonia free and that they value diversity. Jillana encouraged me to go REALLY red during our initial consultation and while I was a bit nervous, I've been in love with my hair ever since. I highly recommend Jillana and Jaivika Salon, and I'm so happy I finally have a dependable stylist in the C-U area!",positive
"Jessica is such a great stylist! She is a very knowledgeable and skilled artist. Not to mention is down to earth, very personable and big on using all organic products. This was my first cut and balayage color with her, but she really exceeded my expectations! My hair looks great and the products I bought from her are amazing. Again all organic-and because she knows so much about her products she matched me with the perfect shampoo & conditioner that has made my hair stay silky smooth. Best of all it didn't cost a ridicules amount like most stylist try to sell you. All in all she was honest, took pride in her work, made sure to let me know If I didn't like anything she would fix it, and has a real positive vibe about her. Thanks again Jessica. I'll be seeing her again for sure.",positive
Jess is by far the best hairdresser I've ever gone to. I absolutely refuse to use anyone else now since she started doing my hair 4 years ago.,positive
Very pleased:) I used a Groupon for cut and high lights. I was in and out in an hour and a half and as a mom that was perfect! I love my hair right now and will definitely be back to see Jessica.,positive
"Jessica is the absolute best at what she does. I say this for a few different reasons: 1. She genuinely cares about you and the integrity of your hair. Huge points in my book because some hair dressers run their business like an assembly line and only care about the money. 2. Her personality shines. She makes you feel like she's known you for years, and makes the time go by fast by talking to you and making you laugh. (Nothing worse than sitting in a chair for two hours in pure silence) 3. Her work is AMAZING. Jessica has many specialities and is master at her craft in every way, but her color is untouchable. She even uses a color line called ""All Nutrient"" which is natural, and all organic for people who have color allergies or sensitivities. Overall, I give Jessica a 10/10 and would recommend anyone to see her!",positive
"Jess is amazing! I've been going to her for 10 years. She's always so helpful when I'm not sure what I want to do but I need a change. She's honest, and so sweet!",positive
"Great place and Jess is nothing short of perfection. It's a very pleasant experience. I've recommended many clients to her, all with amazing reviews too.",positive
"Jessica Taylor is amazing!! She can work magic and makes you look and feel so stunning. She has truly mastered the art of hair color, cuts and style. You won't find anyone better!!!! And her super fun personality will make your visit seem like you are having an outing with your best friend!!! Prepare to have fun and laugh. I just can't say enough great things about Jessica. I won't go anywhere else!!!",positive
"I have been coming to Jess for years! She takes great care of my hair. After moving to Vegas my hair became damaged and broke off really short. Since then, she has grown my hair out and now it is down to my belly and so healthy! I highly recommend her. Her products leave my hair so silky smooth and shiny.",positive
"Found Jessica through groupon and couldn't be any happier! She was so nice and sweet and made me feel so comfortable. The whole experience with her was great and felt like it was hanging out with a friend. She did a trim and colored my hair and it turned out way better than I could imagine. She worked with me to get the results I was aiming for and explained everything I asked. In the 3 hours she was doing my hair, I could tell that she's a hard worker and incredibly talented. I have finally found my hair person and recommend her to all my family and friends, can't go wrong with Jessica :)",positive
"Jessica has been taking great care of my 2 kids and myself for over 8 years. She always seems to find a way to get us in, usually at the last minute. Don't waste your time going anywhere else. Book your appointment with ASAP.",positive
"Jessica is the best! My wife and I have been loyal customers for the past 8 years now. Jess is so friendly and great to talk to. She really knows her craft and I've never had a complaint. She's pretty darn good at making my wife super beautiful with her exceptional styling and coloring skills. I highly recommend Jessica she's definitely one of the best hairstylists in Vegas. +1 extra star for awesomeness, 6 stars!",positive
"Jessica is amazing!!! She is also one of the nicest people I know. She has always listened to my crazy request and will tell me honestly if it's something I should do to my hair. She is sweet,honest and talented!! I would highly recommend her to anyone who has a passion for their hair because she does not disappoint!!",positive
There are just not enough good things I can say about Jessica!! I always come out of her chair feeling and looking like a million bucks! She has a knack for creating the right look for me!!! She is extremely talented in her field!,positive
"Jessica is an incredibly talented and creative hair stylist. Her work is always BEAUTIFUL and she has exceeded every expectation when it comes to color. If you want to find a stylist who is amazing at color, she is your girl! She has such a lovely personality and is always a joy to talk to. Thanks Jess!!",positive
"Where do I start?! This girl is hands down THE BEST hairdresser I've ever had! Not just because of her amazingly sweet personality but she really does know what she's doing and is very knowledgable when it comes to product! Some hairdressers are good with short hair and some with long but not Jess. Jessica can do everything!!!! I started going to Jess back in 2008 when she was at Too Hotties on Eastern. Of course once she left I had to follow her. Ive never met a more caring and sweet individual in my entire life. I moved to Seattle in 2009 and have struggled to find anyone even remotely close. I travel to Vegas 1-2 times a year and I always go see Jess for my haircut and color while in town. She even came to Seattle once and cut my hair in her hotel bathroom! I mean, what hairdresser do you know that would do that?! Not too many, Im sure. I highly highly recommend Jessica! I promise, you won't be disappointed!",positive
"First off, they get 5 stars for the quality of work. The ladies here are legit. They all speak in their native tongue while working, and the place was busy. My coworker gets her braids done here and they cane highly recommended. They get 2 stars for service, because I waited an hour and 15min to get my braids done when i called ahead and was told I would wait no longer than 30min. I had a flight to catch so by the time i got In a chair i had to settle for 2 box braids instead of the 6 cornrows i wanted. She was quick and my braids are beautiful, just not what i wanted. I do plan on giving them a second chance based on the quality, hopefully i get an accurate wait time.",negative
"One of the most unprofessional places I have been to. I was referred to this salon for my daughter. The first time I went, was before our baptism of our children. She said via text that she could do what my daughter asked for. SHE could do, when we got there we got someone else and they were speaking another language, pointing to my daughters hair and laughing. Needless to say, I won't post the pictures of our baptism because I hate the way her hair looks. The week after the hair was replaced by Kiki herself and it looked great. The second time I went was for individual braids for my daughter. Didn't do a bad job on them. But told me whenever I need a touch up for them to text her. I did, and she never responded. I wrote to her on 6 different occasions. She wrote me back ""when you want"" and when I responded with 4 options, I never heard back. Apparently a touch up isn't worth her time. Find someone else please! Talk to a wall, that's the service you'll get from Kiki",negative
"Its Not Too Many People Who Can Actually Braid In Las Vegas.I Have Been Going To Kiki's For A Couple Of Years And Never Been Disappointed.I Am Very Inpatient And Tender Headed.I Hate Getting Braids Because It Takes So Long,But I Always Get The Box Braids For $160 And Im In And Out In 4 1/2 Hours.Yes They Do Talk In African,And They Very Well Might Be Talking About The Customers But I Really Dont Care I Just Go Get My Hair Done And Mind My Buisness Lol.I Recommend Going Here",positive
I've been going here for over a year. Its my favorite braid shop. I recently had an appointment at 0800 and Kiki was there at 7:45. She went over hair options for my style and it turned out great!,positive
"I have to do an update. The last hairstyle that i told you about- when they braided my daughters hair. No weave added just her own hair.. I took it down and there were two bald spots in her head from where it was braided too tight. My poor baby. Sighhh..Now im afraid to take her ANYWHERE. This sacrred me...and her too. If you want to be bald headed and dont mind them pulling your hair out,go here.",negative
"They were awful. I had only one appointment with them and it was terrible. The service was rude, kiki constantly left from doing my hair to go do whatever else she was doing, she yelled at me when I told her she was hurting my head, she told me it would cost 50 dollars more than what I was originally quoted and to top if off, she was an hour and a half late to my appointment with no apology and didn't even start doing my hair when she got there, she sent someone else to do it. When I told her the lye in the synthetic hair was hurting me, she rudely insisted that it was not her fault and yelled at me for telling her that it caused caustic burns to my scalp. This is an absolutely horrible business. They should be shut down.",negative
"I have been to this shop a total of three times, each time seemed to be worst than the last. It seems like every time my daughter goes to get her hair done we have a problem there. The person they pick don't want to do her hair, they are rude. This last time they put three people doing her hair she was visibly uncomfortable and they showed no concern whatsoever. We will never go back there and I wish everyone luck for those that have had a good experience that is great. We had a horrible experience and will not recommend this place to no one not even enemies",negative
"I wish I had thoroughly read the reviews before going there. Too bad Yelp doesn't have ""0"" stars or negative stars because this shop would surely get that type of rating. I paid $180 for plain ol' box braids and stated that I wanted them in a bun or top knot. I'm over 55 years old and didn't want anything cute, young or fancy ~ just an easy style that I can wear to the gym, do yoga and a little swimming every now and then. The 1st Braider was ""Elise"" and she was fabulous. The 2nd Braider was the Braider from hell. I had to tell her Repeatedly that the braids were too tight; she yanked my head around; wheeled my chair (with me sitting in it) into another chair repeatedly; was inattentive and when she was done they were not full braids but loose at the ends. When I asked her why couldn't braid it to the end she said she couldn't. Ok. Well, what about placing the hair into a bun. She said she couldn't do that either because the braids were too tight. Well, hello ... So you were very aware that the last 4 hours that I spent in your chair, indicating every 4 minutes that the braids were too tight was not made up or fabricated? What a joke. Don't go there! I've new to Las Vegas from Chicago and as a "" naturalista"" since forever, I'm not new to the braid/sew-in scene. They lost a good customer.",negative
"Kiki has a shop now! come over and get your hair done. She doesn't just braid,she weaves too. Quality work done in quick time! And my hair is always on point. She does it how ever I like! She does little kids too. No complaints from me ! Love Love Love! :-)",positive
First off let me say this is the 3 rd time I have been here. Let me start from my first visit when she first opened her business here at this location.... I was extremely happy I got micros that took 5 1/2 no longer than 6 hours. Kiki did not do my hair I was okay with that she had the two sisters do it I was very happy. I'm very picky on my hair ( I know hair I'm from the hair capital yes Detroit) LOL . I was told 180.00 for my micros that was fine I even gave a tip at this appointment. I came back in January 2015 to get box braids and I wanted a big bun I asked Kiki could she do it because I liked the wy she did the other persons hair she said yes. When I got there she parted my hair and left I asked where she was going and she said she was moving today I said okay but you said you were going to do my hair... Okay so I moved pass that... Then the ladies kept going back and forth about how much to charge me Kiki told me 180.00 again and the other lady was saying 200.00 they were trying to hustle me so I said okay I'm not going over 200.00 and that was their tip since they tried to play me and pissed me off because they didn't even put my hiar in a bun talking about it was going to hurt I said this is what I came for I know it's going to be tender... Okay so I left there unhappy plus those braids kept me having a headache because I don't know how to put it up in a bun.... So my final and last appointment was last week Friday I called a couple of days and asked Kiki again if she could do my hair and she said she would call me back when she got home to look in her book... She never called me back so I gave her the benefit and called back thinking maybe she got busy or lost my number in the mist. I called back and the lady said I could come in with Kiki I get there and Kiki has another client in her chair... I said okay maybe it's not meant for Kiki to do my hair.... But I saw the lady who usually does it sitting down and two other women I figured she would do it again instead she had a other lady like in her mid 50's (and who was all in my phone) start my hair I explained that I DIDNT want my edges braided or the back close to my neck for these are the areas that pull and fall out and would make me bald.... I don't do bald... Okay after telling her several times Kiki tells her and she starts speaking in their language which I felt they were talking about me... Kiki showed me how unprofessional she really is she kept rolling her eyes. I don't know if it's their culture but she has lost a customer. Also just know if you have two braiders if someone else comes in your going to lose a braider... It took this older lady 8 hours I had to leave my back was killing me so bad. And when I get some my edges are all braided I paid and walked out. Kiki yelled BYE to me ...not thank you ...do you like your hair nothing.... Simply rude I'm never going back and I wasn't going to write a review because I never want to stop anyone's blessing but I have lost 3 braids and I'm on vacation pissed. So I will leave it up to you to decide if you want to go there.,negative
"If all you want is to sit there and get your hair braided, and you don't care about roaches and those crusty feet being damn near on your lap, this is the place for you! These girls are so unprofessional from asking the customer to do runs for them (with no discount!) to not even acknowledging the fact that these roaches are everywhere!! Not only that but they will quote you a price and at the end tack on another $50!!! I hate this place, NEVER AGAIN! But on the bright side, my braids look nice ???",negative
Beware they will change the price when they finish. Very deceitful and unprofessional gondus. Beware of the braider named Agi. Horrible quality of work. What a waste of $100. She lied about the price said $50 and then said $100 at the end! Never again. Others seem to have the same problem as you can see here in the reviews.,negative
"Just moved to Vegas and needed my hair done for work, I researched around and this place is where I decided to take a chance on.... Never Again!!! She provides the hair and a sure me that the perm braiding hair would work on my Natural hair... im use to marley hair I've been going to Africans shop for 15 years never could I not sleep for threes cause the braids were so so tight... today is day six and my natural hair is showing through and the damn ends are coming down... if you care bout your hair, scalp care n your money Do Not Go to kiki... her prices is not right for the type of hair she uses and length... I am all for spending my money in Black Own businesses.... no more Chinese nail shops or Africans shops... for obvious reasons... can I get one great Black own business that can handle all my beauty needs",negative
"I was so blessed that she fit me in even though I called that same day. Then, I got confused and went to the wrong street... which caused me to be 30 min. late (so rude of me!) She was very kind & really really glad I went/Painless waxing!",positive
"Magdolna was wonderful! It is such a joy to talk with her, and her service is exceptional. I felt so comfortable during my appointment and was very happy with the waxing service she provided. I will definitely be returning! Five stars!",positive
Such a pleasure and one place I'd like to keep going to. So hard to find someone who enjoys and works hard at what they do!,positive
Magdolna is truly amazing!!!! She is so knowledgeable and takes pride in what she does!! I would highly recommend her and her sister if you are looking for a great wax!!,positive
"I absolutely ADORE Magdolna, even when she tortures me! My friends are always hesitant to get waxed, fearing that it will hurt. Well, it does, but only for a few minutes and then you are clean and hair free for weeks, months even! It's SO worth it! I've been going to Magdolna since I was 16 years old (I'm now 44) and I don't trust anyone else. She's amazing! I even drive from CA to Vegas to have her wax my legs! Give her (or her sister Juliana) a call! You won't be sorry (well, after the initial sting - hahah!!)",positive
Malgdona is amazing! Love her! Would never go anywhere else ever again! I highly recommend her or twin sister for any waxing facials ! You will love her!!!,positive
"The most amazing women in their field !!!. These two are the VERY BEST at what they do . I have been going to them for 16 years . And my mother has been going to then since the beginning, They are like family to me and have know me since I was a small child. They treat everyone with warmth and respect and are very professional but make you feel comfortable to express any concerns you have regarding waxing or skin etc.. Don't waist your time or money going anywhere else . Kiiss's Salon is worth any amount they charge. Invest in yourself and go to Kiss's . XOXOX Call to make an apt, they are usually booked and can only take small services walk ins.",positive
"I have been going to Julianna for over 20 years. She is efficient, professional and always does a wonderful job whether it is a wax or facial. She helped me clear up my blemishes many years ago. She and her sister, Magdolna, are caring and positive. I always look forward to my time with Julianna.",positive
I don't like waiting. My appointment was at 6. and I waited 30 min. When she did come out she was in conversation with another client and made me wait longer. I ended up leaving and she didn't even apologize. Don't know where all the good reviews are coming from!!!,negative
"I've been coming to Magdolna & Juliana for over 10 years now and I wouldn't go anywhere else for a Brazilian wax. These sisters were actually some of the first aestheticians in Las Vegas to offer this kind of waxing, and you can certainly tell that they know what they're doing! I've heard horror stories from people regarding Brazilian waxes, but I've always had a great (as great as that can be!) experience here. They are very professional, clean and quick-which is very important as you don't want to be there any longer than you need to be. ;) I never have stray hairs and I always leave happy. I highly recommend them for any waxing needs!",positive
I've been going to Magdolna for 4 years for all my waxing needs. I drive all the way from Summerlin just for her. She makes me feel very comfortable and makes everything as painless as possible. Both her and her sister are very professional plus they have the best sense of humor and the best prices. I won't go anywhere else!,positive
"I can't say enough about these two dynamic ladies. I've been going to them faithfully for more than 10 years now and can't imagine what I'd do if they stopped service! Not only are they the sweetest, kindest women but they are so very talented and really know their stuff. For those of you that get waxed, you know what I mean! If they aren't the best it shows! Want the highest quality work in a place where you feel comfortable (as comfortable as one can while getting waxed!) then visit Magdolna and Julianna at Kiss's Salon for all your waxing and facial needs. I promise you'll be hooked after 1 visit!",positive
"I go here only to get my bikini waxed. There are two of the cutest Hungarian old lady twins who do everything. There's not too many places cheaper in Vegas than $60 and the one I went to that was turned out to be pretty bad. I dunno which twin I get everytime but to me, the least painful bikini wax are the quickest ones. It seriously takes under 4 minutes. I always think there's gonna be stuff left behind but I look down and, whoa, it's all gone! They prefer cash and definitely call to make an appointment because they are always booked.",positive
"So the old salon I used to go to (not going to mention their name, but if you creep on my yelp, I'm sure you'll figure it out). I have been going to them for maybe about two years. My hair goal was always to be super ashy and blonde. After spending literally hundreds of dollars and never reaching my goals I decided to jump ship to LAB. I've been creeping on Lindsey's Instagram and loved loved loved her blonde work! So before leaving for vacation I decided to see if she can get me in for a tone and root touch up. Luckily, she was super flexible and was able to get me in. Wahoo, needless to say my hair turned out awesome! HOLD UP! Did I mention all of their products are vegan friendly even their coffee creamer! I look forward to going back to Lindsey to reach my Hair goals.",positive
"This salon is the definition of professionalism and personality! Jess, Lindsay and Carly are all wonderful! Jess does my hair and not only is her color game strong her extension services are on point as well. She took me from a terrible ombré bayalage to a gorgeous blonde with dimension! The whole team is extremely flexible and work around YOU not themselves! I highly recommend giving them a call for any service!",positive
I've been going to Jess for 2.5 years and she is the best hair dresser I've ever had. I had a bad color job when I first when to her and she corrected the reddish brown back to my natural color. Since then I've had multiple color treatments including balayage and regular hair cuts and she always gets it exactly right. Such a great stylist!! Her new salon is always beautiful and there is ample parking making it very convenient.,positive
I'm loving Lab salon + brow studio. I've known Jessica (the owner) for around two years. I was so happy for her when I found out she was opening her own salon. The decor is timeless and classic. The atmosphere is laid back but still professional. Jess is very knowledgeable about her products and walks me through everything she is doing with my hair/brows (which admittedly I am hard to please with my hair). The salon is very easy to get to and there is plenty of parking. I will always recommend her and her staff to anyone. At Lab salon you will ALWAYS be in good hands!,positive
I received such a great cut and the products Jess used were amazingg!! Definitely planning to go back for microblading when I get the chance! (I attended the grand opening and met a client that recently had it done - it looked phenomenal...definitely worth checking out),positive
Jess is the best! I've been trusting my hair to her for a year before she opened this beautiful salon. Always ecstatic with her work and company while being beautified.,positive
"I will never go anywhere else but LAB Salon... going from naturally brown to blonde hair is not an easy transition but not only did Jessica listen as I voiced all of my concerns (i.e. damage of bleaching my hair, worrying about if my eyebrows match, etc) she created the perfect blonde shade that, those who didn't know me previously, thought was my natural color!!! Since, I can't imagine trusting anyone else with my hair. The salon is Pinterest worthy and Jessica is the best.",positive
"Been looking for a salon that actually gives me what I am looking for, had a consult with Jessica for color and extensions. I felt super comfortable and she clearly knew what she was doing and understand exactly what I wanted. LOVE my color and extensions!!! Finally found my new salon!!! I am officially obsessed!! Jessica is awesome!! Highly recommend her!!",positive
"Safe to say I am obsessed with Jessica and LAB!! The place is impeccable, clean, trendy and everything I want in a salon! I feel fabulous whether Jessica is doing a quick blowout or cut and color. All my girlfriends go to Jessie and are equally obsessed! Cutest salon in the burgh!!",positive
Im so happy With my cut an color!!!so Natural-Jessica did an amazing job!she listened an took her time with me!she is very talented and up to date on New styles/ color and balayage! Also the products used are great! My Hair feels so Healthy! Im rebooked and looking forward to my next process of my hair color transformation. Thankyou Lab Salon,positive
"So the place isn't much to look at but that didn't worry me. The staff was really nice, but unfortunately I didn't have the best experience. The cut was fine but nothing special. Where my rating really goes down is that I ended up styling my hair by myself. They made it stick-straight so I asked for some curl but he said it wasn't possible but offered to let me try. I curled it easily with the straightening iron like I normally do. I would've normally just gone home and did it myself but I'm traveling and don't have my iron. Also he charged me $10 extra because my hair was long, which I wouldn't consider it to be. Overall, nice people, but not the best experience.",negative
"As other reviews have stated, the owner/stylist is extremely rude. The same as what another reviewer stated, I bought a Groupon, booked an appointment, and was refused service unless I paid an additional price for ""long hair"". I don't have an issue with that, except for the fact that my hair is not considered long by any means that would merit charging extra for a cut. When I questioned him, he was extremely rude in his response and could not tell me at what length hair started to be considered ""long"". This makes me think that he is trying to charge this additional fee for anyone having medium length hair, thus eliminating the savings offered by the Groupon. Definitely would not recommend, salon was also extremely sketchy and dirty looking - probably a blessing I didn't end up getting a cut there!",negative
"Wonderful atmosphere. I got a cut and color, it was fabulous, staff was very warm and welcoming. I will definitely be coming back. Please check out this salon downtown!",positive
"This was the worst salon experience of my life. I went in for a haircut, blow out and style. There was a huge wait even though I had made an appointment ahead of time. Despite this, when I finally got to the stylist chair, he chided me for being late. When I informed him that I had shown up on time, he nonchalantly said ""oh that must've been the other girl who was late"" with little apology for his rudeness. I waited for an hour and a half before the stylist even got to my hair cut. After being rude and blaming me for being late, he proceeded to do a slight trim and point blank refused the style I asked of him. The entire staff was rude and insulting from start to finish. The owner kept telling me how accomplished he was for having a salon in downtown Calgary, but everything about him screamed sub-professional. From his mannerism, to his hair technique to the upkeep of the salon. There was a garbage bin right beside where I was getting my hair washed. I sorely regret giving them my business and will be vocally recommending others away from this business.",negative
"I tried La Bella Salon from a groupon and was very happy. The service was awesome, they made sure I had a nice long scalp massage and I left with the best cut I have had in a long time. I am trying to grow my hair out and Jas knew just what to do. Most other places said they would chop off half and inch and I came out with a few inches gone - Jas cut off the ends making it look healthy again. Very happy!",positive
"I had the worst haircut of my life at this salon. The cut was blunt cut and uneven when i asked for layers, my fringe was chopped off to the middle of my forehead when i asked for but below the eyebrows, etc. The owner/stylist kept saying it was what i had asked for, and thankfully another customer sympathized with me and admitted the cut was not what I'd described. I was so disappointed that I rushed to another salon to get it fixed. The new stylist was shocked that a ""professional"" had done the cut because it was so bad. Please avoid this place - don't support such a shady business!",negative
"Wow. I went here due to a recommendation from a friend, and I was blown away. I was personally seen to by the owner himself, and he was fabulous. I was made to feel like a princess. (Gentlemen, if you're not looking for princess treatment, you will still get amazing service.) It is relevant for me to state that I have some looong hair. My numerous past foil experiences led me to believe that 5+ hours was the normal allotted time period for having my glorious mane washed, coloured, and trimmed to perfection. Well, lemme tell you: That man had me outta there within 3 hours. I would like to add that at no point did I feel like he was rushing; he was simply quick and efficient. ""Well, Stranger on the interwebs,"" you might be saying, ""If he got you out so quickly, your hair must have looked atrocious!"" So not the case! My hair looked, felt, and smelled beautiful. It's obvious that this is what he loves to do, and he has the skill to back it up. It was the best hair experience that I recall ever having. The head massage alone is enough to make me return to this mystical place of perfect coiffure. The rest -- the timely colour, the professional cut, the welcoming attitude -- was icing on the cake. ""Oh, talkative Narrator,"" you may ask, ""A salon such as this must be very busy."" True. So very true. This hair savant serviced many a person while I was there, but at no point did I feel neglected. It's a delicate dance of delegation to his workers and time management, and he pulled it off flawlessly. ""Miss Chatterbox,"" you could be thinking, ""That's all very nice, but what does it cost?"" A superb cut and colour can be pricey, but this was well below what I've paid at some salons. I believe a list of prices is available on the website. I ended up calling for my estimate. Thanks for reading my novelette. I obviously have no lack of good things to say about this place. All I will say further is that you will be giving yourself a real treat if you see Sam at La Bella Salon.",positive
"Love this little place. Not sure why the bad reviews. Cheap hair cuts. I get a simple hair cut and usually when I come in, there isn't a long wait. I used to live at the corner of Vegas Valley and S Nellis so it was a great place to walk straight down to get my hair cut. I've since moved outta state and will miss this place.",positive
"Be careful when you let these ladies cut your kids hair!! My sister took in my nephew for a haircut and the lady cut his scalp! If I could give no stars, I would!",negative
"I went in for some highlights, which would be the first time ever that i dye my hair... I explained to the hair stylist how i wanted my hair and she seamed to understand, or so I thought... She started working on my hair, and then left me waiting while she worked on other people, my head started to burn and I told her about it, and she looked at me with a oops i forgot about you face and she rushed me to the sink to wash my hair, and as shes unfolding each foil paper on my head she has this look on her face like she did something wrong, which started to worry me... When she walks me back to the chair and i see my hair I flipped! she bleached my hair too long and made my highlights white!! Well at least the bottom layers of my hair are white while the top layer is yellow! I was so freaked out I nearly cried! And all she did was tell me it would look nice once she dried it and curled it. I was so upset i didnt want her to do anything else to my hair but my husband convinced me to give it a try, so i let her dry my hair and curl it but it didn't fix anything! And besides the whole color fuck up, she made the highlight like 2 inches away from my roots... Idk if that how its supposed to be or not but Im not happy at all! Now im scared to dye my hair again lol bottom line is dont get your highlights done here!",negative
I was looking for a place that can do 2 things... color my hair & haircut. They took about 15 minutes until they started working on me. I did my hair a 2 tone brown. It looks lovely. I also cut my hair. My total was 95. Not too bad.,positive
This place is cute and adorable for the whole family! At first it is somewhat hidden but you won't miss the red $5 haircut sign. I've met the owner and she is super friendly and professional the staff is bilingual! I like to get my waxing done here It's only $8 ! It does lack more parking. Overall this place is great,positive
"Great place! Quick, easy and flexible! Got there a little early and they fit me right in. Had waxing done and she was great! Only in town for the weekend and one of the most painless waxings I have had. Highly recommended!",positive
I can't say enough good things about Tinashe. I go to her for waxing and she is incredible - makes you very comfortable.,positive
Absolutely the worst hair cut and experience I've ever had. My hair ended up looking so choppy and uneven I was shocked. When I told her to fix it she started scolding me for not having even hair. Just mind blown on how horrible the customer service but even worse how bad my hair cut was. Did I mention while I was asking her to fix it her coworker stepped in and told her to just do a full cut wash and style and to charge me another $85 on top because she should not charge me just $30 for 10 mins of work. I'm so sad at what they did to my hair at this salon and I hope no one ever has to experience this. Photos attached!,negative
"Tinisha does a great job waxing. It's been awhile since I've waxed as I remember it hurt a lot, but today's experience was painless.",positive
Tinisha is amazing. She is so good at what she does and is so caring and sweet. I've always had a great experience here.,positive
"Had an amazing experience with Sascha and Tanisha yesterday who did an updo and makeup application for me. They are lovely, friendly and extremely skilled. Great work! Would highly recommend!",positive
I tried La Jolie Femme for the first time today and I am impressed! My manicure is awesome! Tinisha is excellent - she has a lovely & friendly manner about her that makes you feel at ease. The location is in a very convenient nook near University & Wellington. I'll be back :),positive
I had an event at a hotel down the street and booked style and makeup the girls listened to what I asked for and the results were excellent the price was exactly as advertised the salon was clean and the staff was friendly,positive
Tinisha was so great! Been a while since my last wax and she made me feel so comfortable throughout the appointment. Super professional and friendly! Will absolutely be returning to check out the other services they offer.,positive
"This place is amazing, the woman who did my treatment was honestly amazing. I'm going to go here for everything. The time and attention and great conversation made the experience lovely.",positive
"I went here with a Groupon for a Brazilian wax. I believe the owner was the woman who did the waxing for me. Let me tell you how bad this was! I was in so much pain and she was so inconsiderate telling me to be more flexible .. i was bleeding so bad when I looked down at one point and saw the amount of blood on my thighs, I was shocked.. When i got home I was still bleeding after 2 hours and had to wear a pad .. it was like a mini-period.. I am still in a lot of pain today and noticed that a lot of the hairs are broken and have not been waxed properly.. I was put through so much pain to have this kind of sloppy work done? Are you serious? I will not be returning to this place. Edit: thanks to this place I now have a really painful skin boil in my private area to deal with.. thank you la jolie femme",negative
"Great experience! Bought a Brazillian wax from groupon. The place is clean, elegant but a little small. The 2 girls working there are very friendly. The girl who did my Brazillian made me feel very comfortable and kept conversation to keep my mind off the awkwardness/pain. Will defenitly be returning!",positive
"I'm not changing my rating given the quality of pedi, mani and threading that Tinisha provides. She's gentle, got steady hands and is good at what she does. My bigger issue is with the owner, who is a little loud and stingy. She's really weird about the girls here using too many towels and often doesn't honour the discount program they have for regular customers. The girls working here are a lot nicer to deal with. It's not the cheaper places around, but they know what they're doing.",positive
"I recently decided to start getting Brazilian waxes again, and after reading a couple of positive reviews about La Jolie Femme here on Yelp, I decided to buy a Groupon for three brazilians. My first appointment was with Tynesha, who was very sweet and friendly, making me feel relaxed and comfortable, and that definitely helped when the Brazilian started because it HURT. Tynesha was very reassuring, but after I went home, I had a rash for four days and realized that at least half the hair was broken off, not waxed out. However, I wanted to give them a second chance, so I went back this past week to see Elizabeth. She was terrific, very friendly and accommodating, and thorough. My appointment was almost painless (although I had taken two extra-strength Advil beforehand as well!) Both girls were lovely people and great to chat with, which was a welcome distraction.

"I bought a deal from Buytopia for their Manicure and Pedicure. First, when I got there, they were running out of hot water for pedicure. I had to wait for 15 minutes. In addition to the long wait, they don't seem to sanitize their tools. Second, they did not soak my fingers in the nail cleanser before applying the nail polish. Third, they don't have proper fans/lighting to dry hands or feet. Through out the process, the girls kept gossiping to each other about their other colleagues or clients very loudly. (Come on, this is a spa! I am not paying to listen to your complaints about your life!) Lastly, despite all the bad things happened, they imposed a mandatory tip and HST of $17, on top of $19 I already paid to Buytopia. I ended up paying $36 for an awful experience.",negative
Love this place! You can call in and make a reservation for a specific stylist or just show up and check in fo first available. I always do first available and have always received a great haircut.,positive
"For the money, I'd go here over those other chain places like Great Clips or Supercuts any day of the week. I believe Ashley has cut my hair twice, super nice and she did a great job (one of the best and cleanest fades I've ever gotten). Staff is friendly, the shop is clean and it's priced competitively. Will be back.",positive
"Like many others, it seems the onslaught of radio ads actually worked because I eventually went. Don't let the ads fools you...this is just a standard barber shop geared more toward the ""man's man"". I have now gone 3 times and get a near perfect cut every time. I've had the same stylist, Krista, cut my hair. She's very nice and obviously has a lot of experience cutting hair. My main criteria for sticking with a barber shop is consistency. Krista has cut my hair exactly the same way every time. That's enough to keep me going back in spite of the ""wicked awesome"" commercials.",positive
"Julia was absolutely awesome! I haven't had a professional hair cut in 15 years. I've been just buzzing it the same length all around and I now understand why I'm not a stylist. She did an amazing job! I knew about what I wanted, but I told her I trusted her to help pick the lengths and it turned out perfect. She was very nice and very professional. I will definitely be going there from now on. Ask for Julia if you want an excellent hair cut.",positive
Have not had a bad haircut yet. Been going to this place for a few years and always am a happy camper afterwords. Girls are mostly great looking and some are better conversationalists than others. I like it!,positive
"This place is a parody of itself. It's almost as if the whole idea behind Lady Jane's was based on a wild dream of a pubescent 16-year-old boy. Needless to say, I had to see what the hype was about.... Perhaps you've heard the outrageously cheesy radio commercials advertising ""wicked awesome"" haircuts for $10? Well, being that the latest location was situated right down the street from me and with the bad economy and all, I thought I'd see what was so ""wickedly awesome"" about it. As you walk-in, you come to a computer monitor where you browse screen shots of the stylists to chose from. That's right, you pick based on looks as to who earns the right to work on your dome. The busty blonde was my pick. (The naughty looking red with stiletto's was my second choice). In the wait area, there's black leather recliners and plasma TV's to keep you entertained. If that doesn't do it for you, feel free to challenge one of the hambone patrons to a game of foosball. If you're more of the well read type, browse back-issues of Sports Illustrated. The atmosphere was hardly conducive to reading with all the distractions though, including Nickelback and other generic rock blaring from the overhead speakers. When your scantily dressed stylist is ready for you, she calls you back to her station. Each station has it's very own plasma TV. I wasn't looking to be hypnotized by the boob-tube though, only the boobs.",negative
He made me look beautiful! Got a lot of compliments on my new hair cut. Hoping he can make me look this beautiful always!,positive
"The reviews are VERY accurate. Nadar is very talented. He was very quick (wash, cut and style in 45 mins). I gave him a rough guideline on what I wanted, he asked a couple of questions and I got the look I was looking for perfectly. I will be back.",positive
"This guy NAder is amazinggggggg!!!!!! He washed cut and styled my hair in 20mins!!!!! And it's the most amazing cut I've ever had in my life and I'm not just saying this to give him a great review, I really mean it my blow out was amazing!!!! Everything was amazing!",positive
"Amazing hair cut! Seriously! best hair cut i have ever had! Nader cut my 3a thick curly hair perfectly! first try! after YEARS of trying to get my hairdresser to cut my hair a certain way and in long layers! Nader has the gift of figuring out what you want and delivers! He cut my hair quickly, but with precision and confidence. He also takes the time to listen to your concerns and makes honest recommendations. No hesitation in recommending Nader, he is truly a gifted hairstylist. I look forward to many more visits. So glad i found this salon and right in my neighborhood!",positive
"I arrived and walked out within 40 minutes, and I was early for my appointment. Nader cut my hair so quickly with so much confidence. And then did my blow out while working simultaneously on another girls treatment. Just masterful. I will definitely be back.",positive
"My first Haircut by Nader, so VERY happy with my hair !!! many times I have to go home and restyle when other stylists do my hair ( have always gone to high end Toronto salons) not this time I felt great !!! Very professional a talented stylist !!! will definitely be back and tell my friends finally no need to drive or train to TO. What was really great was I got exactly what I Asked for and Nader advised different ways to style and wear my hair, Excellent !!!!!!",positive
"I recently moved to Pickering and dreaded having to find another hair dresser. My thick black hair is not easy to cut properly, especially how I like it. So after finding this place I decided to cautiously try it out. The result? Right on the mark with the first try. I was very impressed with how quickly Nadar, the hair dresser and owner, delivered exactly what I asked for. No more trepidation. I'll be coming back again.",positive
"It was my first time going to Laia Hair Styling. Nader did a great job on my hair he did really quick, and I show my picture how I want it. If you want to try this Laia hair Styling you need to set an appointment to see Nader he's the only one working there.",positive
"I decided to make an appt with Nader after finding him on YELP. I was in Pickering visiting my family over the holidays and needed a good blow out which is hard to come by. I took a chance and it was the BEST blowout I think I've ever had. Nader was very flexible with timing, he listened to what I wanted, and did exactly that. I showed him a few pics too and right away he knew the look I was going for (Maria Menounos hair!). He was done in 30mins and the blow out lasted a very long time. He is also very reasonable price wise. Thanks for a great blow-out Nader, maybe you'll decide to move to Vancouver so that I can have good hair days more often :-)",positive
"Nader is the Master of hair stylists. Cut, color and styled quickly and better than anyone. His blow drying styles last soooo long. He also highlights and cuts my 25 year old daughter's hair who lives in Toronto but travels to Pickering to have Nader work his magic. Many of our friends have become his clients as well. His expertise and great pricing keeps us all coming back",positive
Daniel has been brining color to my life with his hair magic and wonderful soul since I moved to Cleveland last summer! Not only does he slay my hair on the regular but he always has my 10 year old daughter styled to be the coolest kid in school too! Daniel and the Le Beau ladies are our favorite Friday mother daughter treat!,positive
"Finding a new hair salon can be such a hassle so I'm here to tell you Jackie is a hair goddess. Seriously. I've come here I think 3 or 4 times over the past two years (not because I go elsewhere- just because my life is hectic and I'm lazy) and I always love my look better than I ever have before - as in ever in my entire life. It's crazy how much hair can change your entire aesthetic. I usually don't come into hair appointments with much of a direction because I have absolutely no knowledge of what ""works"" for me and I think that's exactly what Jackie excels at creating. Additionally, I've always been told that I shouldn't go blonde because it would look bad with my dark eyes and an olive-y (not my words- I think I'm pale lol) skin tone. Well since no one likes being told what to do I decided I was going to try it and Jackie NAILED IT with the color - it looked so wonderful on me and I personally like it better than brunette me. She gives you a realistic expectation of what she thinks she can achieve while still keeping your hair healthy and won't tell you that she can do anything she doesn't think is viable. Neither of us thought we would get my hair as light as we did so it was a pleasant surprise :) Aside from talent, this saloon is super welcoming and the staff seems to genuinely get along great. They have all your boujee hair care needs with Kevin Murphy products (if you have super dry hair you neglect for months on end like I do they're a necessity). Last but not least, they're pretty much in a girl gang with the other lady-owned Tremont businesses so whats not to love?",positive
"I booked an appointment here on a whim because I really, really needed a cut/color, I couldn't get in with my regular stylist at a different salon, and Le Beau was able to give me a same day appointment because of a last minute cancellation. Wow, did I get lucky. I had an appointment with the amazing, talented, creative Daniel Price who worked some serious magic to lift the red color out of my hair and give me a beautiful caramel tone after just two color application appointments. On top of the beautiful hair cut/color, Daniel introduced me to Kevin Murphy products. He explained that they are like ""skin care products, but for your hair."" So, basically they are really ""hair care"" products. Now, I'll admit, I'm a total beauty product junkie. I'm always trying new products and jumping from one brand to another, but using Kevin Murphy products has stopped me in my tracks. These products bring hair care to a whole new level. I've been using the wash, rinse, hair spray and resort product for over two months now and the one time I had to use a different brand (still high-end) I saw a noticeable difference in the way my hair looked and felt. So now I'm hooked. I know this is a long review, but I just also have to mention that everyone at this salon is so friendly. They greet you by name as you walk in the door, and don't have that ""too cool for school"" vibe that I've seen at a lot of other salons. Thank you Le Beau for giving me a great experience every time I'm there. You guys rock!",positive
"A friend of mine recommended to go to Le Beau and see Jackie - his recommendation was spot on. I keep a fairly conservative hairstyle, and I've found that several places interpret this in an edgy way. Jackie listened to my request, did a fantastic job, and I left with probably one of the best haircuts I've ever had. In terms of the amenities, the salon is really nice and has a unique style (ex. the drawers are made of craftsman tool boxes) and the chairs are comfortable. Jackie and staff are very nice and knowledgeable about the neighborhood, which is beneficial as I'm relatively new to Tremont. Note - they do offer facial waxing treatments to compliment the haircuts. Definitely will be back.",positive
"My name is Kristen and I'm a 30 something mom who likes awesome hair! Lol. So let me tell you that for the last ten years I've lived all over- I've moved probably 6 times (due to school + work + jobs) on the east coast and the Midwest, and I'm always on the hunt for where I can stay looking sharp! This is NOT easy let me tell you! Le Beau is the 5th salon I've tried since moving to Cleveland almost 4 years ago and it's hands down THE BEST. Not only in the Cleveland area but it's my favorite salon EVER! I wear a short pixie cut and I like it classy and fun (which I don't think is easy to do) and Jackie nails it every time! Jackie is really great at communicating which I think is key. She is also very perceptive, flexible, and detail oriented. Jackie, Lauren, and all the girls will make you feel right at home. If you are looking for exceptional service and a look that is spot on you have found the right place with Le Beau!",positive
"I have been coming to Le Beau for well over a year now and why has it taken me so long to tell everyone how great it is?!! I don't even know! I was an avid grocery store box dye kind of girl and I just was looking for a change. To have someone like Jackie explain things and suggest styles to me have changed my life! I honestly leave feeling so good/pretty. Jackie (the owner) and all her staff, they are so nice and professional. I urge anyone that are on the fence about giving up the grocery store life style DO IT!!!! You will never go back",positive
Found out about Le Beau through Yelp and was not disappointed!! I had a cut and color with Jackie and i LOVE it! I cut off probably about 10 inches and did a balayge. I showed her a picture briefly just as an an idea but she had it down. She knew exactly what I wanted. Prices are reasonable. I would highly recommend her and Le Beau!,positive
"I am new to town and have been looking for a new salon. I wanted to try out this place and when I called they recommended Jackie. I explained what I was looking for color wise and we agreed to cut off 2 inches because I was trying to grow my hair out but wanted to cut off the bad ends. The color turned out pretty nicely, however... She cut off 4-5""... Way more than I agreed to. I tried to be happy leaving the salon but I woke up the next morning really upset and have not been happy about the cut since. I wanted to get a warning to anyone who's trying out this salon for the first time to ask for a minimal amount to get cut off, otherwise you may leave with your hair a lot shorter than you asked for.",negative
"Nicolette transformed my botched hair job into something so cute, you would never know how it used to look. I loved the atmosphere of this salon and every single person working here was so friendly and welcoming I referred my boyfriend to the same stylist and he looks fantastic, I would recommend to any and everyone. Thankful to have found my new stylist!",positive
DO NOT GO HERE. The hair stylists do not listen to what you want. While they are brilliant with color (hence the two stars) they are horrible with hair cuts. I've been here twice and the first time the hair stylist cut my hair in a weird way. But since the color was so great I overlooked it. The second time I went another lady cut my hair WAY shorter than I wanted it. I showed her pictures of what I wanted and she did not pay attention to them. They do not listen to what you want and just do what they want. My hair is ruined because they did not pay attention to what I wanted. I will never go here again. Also very over priced for what you get.,negative
"I've been going to Le Beau (formerly Studio Le Beau on W. 11th in Tremont) and getting my hair cut by the owner, Jackie, for more than 5 years. She is phenomenal! I've never had a bad hair cut! Jackie is super cool and super personable. The new space, Le Beau, is hip and stylish. I love their line of products by Kevin Murphy out of Australia. Definitely keeps my super curly hair tamed and frizz-free. I cannot say enough good things about this place. Go and check it out!",positive
"Booked this appointment yesterday because I knew I would have time to get my haircut after traveling in from Texas, and I'm so glad I made it here. Kate was awesome, she really listened to what I wanted and did an awesome job with my cut and style. The product they use is also great. If I move to Cleveland then I will definitely be back!",positive
"Reasonably priced and generally speaking, all the ladies are super nice and have top-notch style and fashion sense. I feel like I can trust their hair design / stylizing suggestions and tips. I really like their Kevin Murphy line of hair products as well. The environment is contemporary with a brick, wood, and iron trendy Greek.",positive
"I loved this place so much, I was my first time coming here and they really do an amazing job !! I definitely advice you to visit Le Manoir, trust me you won't regret it ;)) .....",positive
"So first, i was greeted with a closed shop when it said on the internet that it was open until 8. There was a sales person, and what looked like to be the owner or manager. they basicly shooded me off the front of the shop... i tried to ask a question so that i dont return the next day for nothing again and this cruella devil Wannabe petting a chihuahua came to the door looking at me as if i was begging her for something and wanted me to yell my question throw the door... so i decided that i wasnt going to beg someone to take my money and take my business elsewhere. This place is barely a beauty parlor anymore... more like a cheap retail store with cheap stuff from etsy and the employees think they are way cooler then cool. As for the actual service... well you know when someone got there nails done there because everyone has the same unoriginal designs. Not worth the money",negative
"Le meilleur salon à Montréal, des ongles beaux et en santé, employés super sympathique, on se sent tout simplement bien quand on passe au manoir!",positive
"(Français et anglais) J'ai longtemps fait affaire avec le Manoir pour mes ongles et c'est très différent des expériences dans des salons asiatiques. Les filles font attention à nos ongles comme si c'était les leurs. Pas de limage intense, pas d'acétone et un bon signe pour voir qu'elles utilisent de bons produits de qualité : elles ne portent pas de masque lorsqu'elles sont à l'oeuvre. Elles vendent de coquets vêtements, maillots de bain et divers petites ''mignonneries''. Puisque c'est un service et des produits haut de gamme, les prix sont plutôt élevés mais je n'ai jamais été déçue d'une manicure reçue par le Manoir. J'ai été au salon pour un an environ et maintenant mes ongles sont plus en santé que jamais! Ils étaient cassants et minces, maintenant ils sont durs comme de la roche et longs comme des faux ongles donc je peux juste me mettre du vernis à la maison. Si vous avez les sous, je recommende Le Manoir. Émilie est une excellente propriétaire et écoute toujours nos histoires, une vraie place de fifille! I used to go to Le Manoir for a year because i had thin nails that kept breaking. They use really good quality products and the girls are really nice to talk to. I liked going there for my nails since they got unique stuffs (as clothes, jewelry, skin products) and as a girly woman, i like to do a little bit of shopping after getting my nails perfectly well done. Strongly recommend Emilie and her team if you want your nails to grow healthy and strong. Sadly don't go there anymore because my nails are thick enough naturally now (FIRST TIME OF MY LIFE!) and really long so i can just apply nail polish at home, but makes me really miss the girls they are so nice and friendly.",positive
"Been getting my nails done here for months and I LOVE this place! Not only is the service wonderful, but the ladies are all so talented and passionate about what they do! I also recently got my first haircut here and loved it as well. I definitely recommend this to everyone! They also sell lovely clothes & jewelry. Great find & so happy I am a regular! ;)",positive
"I was very excited to hear about this new spa and upon viewing their Instagram was impressed by their nail art. I called to book a massage but was told by the lady on the phone that it was a better deal to purchase a Tuango voucher for a massage/facial and although I couldn't find many reviews online I bought the voucher without thinking too much about it. BIG MISTAKE. I have rarely had to deal with such incompetence. I had to call several times over several days before I could finally speak to someone. Then I was told they only had space two weeks from then. I figured it didn't much matter and looked forward to the date I could get the facial. I tried calling back closer to the facial to try to also get a manicure but I was told that was not possible. Unfortunately, on the day of the facial I woke up with a terrible stomach flu and spent the whole morning and afternoon throwing up. I was aware of the 48 hour cancellation policy but as these were extenuating circumstances I called to cancel. I was told it was too late, if I couldn't make it I would lose the value of the voucher. When I explained that I understood the policy but that I was much too sick to go, I was told it wouldn't ""be fair to their other clients if they allowed me to cancel last minute"". Seriously? Is it more fair to their other clients if I show up and contaminate all of them? Is it fair to have the aesthetician be forced to deal with someone throwing up on their table? Is it fair for me to lose $70 because I cannot physically make it to the spa in this condition? I think not. Where is the common sense in this?! So I'm stuck at home sick as dog and flushing $70 down the drain because the staff at Le Manoir-Coquetterie are a bunch of unsympathetic jerks and crooks. I might as well have been robbed by them, it would be the same outcome. There are TONS of spas and salons in Montreal. Save your money and go somewhere else where you might actually be treated with respect. UPDATE: After 3 weeks, they finally replied to my complaint on Social Media and denied the fact that they refused to reschedule the appointment. They insisted that they had offered to reschedule for the same price of the coupon even though that was precisely the opposite of what happened. Further proving my point that Le Manoir - Coquetterie is NOT TO BE TRUSTED.",negative
"I will never go back here. It was a complete waste of time and money. I had also gotten the FabFind deal for a wash, cut and style. Unlike other reviewers, I got through on the first call and was able to book an appointment for a convenient time. I got there 15 mins early and they weren't busy so they got me started right away. The staff did not seem particularly friendly or enthusiastic about their jobs. I've always found salons I've frequented to be full of energy, but at Lid it felt like no one wanted to be there. No one offered me any beverages or anything. It was just a really blah atmosphere and I wanted to get out of there asap. I went over what I wanted with the stylist (just a trim and some layers). I always love getting head massages during the wash but didn't get one here. The stylist then proceeded to roughly brush out my tangles, trim my ends, and as I reminded him I was in desperate need of some layers put in, he took a call on his cell phone! I was shocked silent. I've never seen such unprofessional behavior before! He didn't even apologize or explain why he needed to take a call in the middle of cutting my hair. Anyways, I have curly hair and it was a humid day so I wanted to keep my hair curly rather than get a blow out. However, he was blow drying my hair straight before I could even say anything. I also didn't get the layers I wanted. In the end, the whole thing took less than 30 min and my hair looked exactly like it normally does when I straighten it. I stupidly tipped the guy what I normally tip a stylist and regretted it immediately. It was totally undeserved. Oh well I got to use up the deal at least. It's too bad that I now have to go get my hair cut again next week! This time I'm going to Industry a few blocks away that comes highly recommended from a friend. Unfortunately, I'll have to pay double but I think it'll be worth it.",negative
"This is no doubt my favourite pampering place to go to ! I had had my hair done here in the past 3 years and every time it is unique and styled to the max ! I have people stop me on the street and ask me where do I get my hair done. I went from black to blonde and back again - all maintaining a healthy beautiful hair & cut ! Vanessa the owner, is a true artist and the staff is professional and fun.",positive
"I have been with LID since the beginning and even before - half of my 35 years I have seen Vanessa! I receive compliments on my hair colour and cut on a weekly basis and have never been anything but 100% satisfied with my hair, their service and their advice. Wishing them every single success and the accolades they certainly deserve.",positive
"I saw a woman crossing the street with most phenomenal hair cut and colour about 2 years ago, so I asked her what salon she goes to and she said ""Lid...It's the best."" I was looking to find a new stylist after being unsatisfied and with the salon I was going to, so I made an appointment. The location is incredibly easy to get to, being in the heart of Yorkville, and the best part of it is that it comes without ego or pretension. The space is warm and the people are easygoing and very inviting, not Snobville at all...I met with Mel, who I was immediately comfortable with, she was like a friend, who just happens to have a top shelf brain and vision for really great hair. She understands the actual chemistry and science behind color and the true art and lines of a cut. I am always impressed by her knowledge and eye. I appreciate the feeling you get from a person who is obviously educated and very good at what they do, as that can be hard to find. When I started seeing her, my hair was just above my shoulders, curly and full. I wanted to grow it out. My colour was dark brown, and I needed my roots done. The colour adjustment she did was perfect, she took the edge off the brown/black harshness that happens when you need touch ups on dark hair, and the cut was exact. As my hair grew out, Mel shaped it and cut it, so that it always looked longer as it was growing, and I guess the proper word for it would be, balanced. I never felt like it was getting top heavy or winging out. She explained to me how my hair had been cut in the past and how she is going to cut it this time to create the look I'm going for. I am one of those people who when I leave a salon, I need to feel that I am leaving with exactly what I wanted or else I can't get my mind off it, and every time I leave Lid I feel it is done right, the first time, no second guessing, no settling. I am very particular about that. For the last several years, my hair has been dark brown, and whenever I have tried to lighten it in the past in anyway, it has always looked brassy or unhealthy, but I always wanted it a bit lighter. So now, my hair has grown out to long past my shoulders, and I have lightened it a few shades, dabbled in the ombre look and have perfectly toned highlights throughout, and I love it. The colour is perfection, my skin tone is balanced, and my cut is exactly how I envisioned it to be as it grew out. I have had strangers compliment my hair and ask me what salon I go to, just like it started for me. I have witnessed all the stylists there, and am continuously impressed with their work. Salons and stylists are personal, and when you find the right one it clicks. Lid is my recommendation every time.",positive
"I was referred to Lid Salon from a friend of mine who had been going to one of their stylists for about a year prior and had always been extremely happy with their services. I booked an appointment with the same stylist and didn't have a problem getting an appointment. I did have to wait a week but they were great at accommodating a time that worked in my schedule and were very friendly on the phone( I had been told they were usually booked solid). anyways, I instantly liked the vibe there. Its not overly luxurious but it made up for that in charm and warmth. I was offered a drink within being there for two minutes and another stylist chatted with me while I waited for my appointment. I was getting my hair coloured and cut and am super specific about what i want, so i usually place a lot of trust in a stylist to actually figure it out because i just start referencing a bunch of famous people and hope that they can come up with some sort of hybrid hair do. Luckily, my stylist wanted to talk, was super current and seemed to have it figured out pretty quickly. Got my hair washed and got a massage by an assistant I think....she was super nice as well. I left not only liking the colour but changed my bangs a little, at her suggestion....which normally I would have been so nervous about, but she made me feel confident that they would look great...and they did. When i was done everyone there seemed interested in the result,which i have never experienced before. Other stylists mentioning how great it looked and so on. It made me feel more confident to leave then getting a lipstick touch-up like some other salons do on the way out. I had a great first experience at Lid and will definitely be returning.",positive
"Reading Julia's review, it is very similar to my experience. I went to Lid with a FabFind deal for highlights, wash, blowdry and cut. I had left 3 messages when calling during their opening hours, before someone finally called me back to book the appointment. Had I not already paid, I'd have heard the message bank once and called the next salon down the road instead. When I arrived for my appointment, the hairdresser briefly went through what I'd like done today. I was given a choice of 3 colours for highlights, other salons would give me a book of samples to flick through. None of the options were 100% what I was looking for, but I didn't ask to see other colours. At other salons I've always placed some trust in the colours advised by the hairdresser and was always happy with the result even if it wasn't what I had in mind. I guess the colours offered here were either a poor advisement, or a misinterpretation of what I said I wanted, because I wasn't happy with the colour I picked. I was offered tea or coffee while my hair was being coloured. The end result was the highlights having roots of 5-7mm on the day they were done, looking like they were done over a month ago. Overall I'm pretty disappointed with the quality of customer service, communication, and the final product. This is the first time I've left a salon thinking that my hair looked better beforehand. I wouldn't return, even for a discounted deal.",negative
"After letting it grow for months and months with nary a cut, my hair had become something of an wild, untamed mess. No longer wishing to risk being mistaken for Medusa, I decided that something had to be done. Always on the lookout for great salons and ways to pinch pennies, I ended up snagging a Fabfind deal for a wash, blowdry and cut for $35 at Lid back in May. I probably called 2 or 3 times and left a message that wasn't returned before I was able to make an appointment, which was slightly annoying. Their website states that their hours are 8am to ""closing"", whenever that is, but it seemed like any time I tried to call after 5pm nobody picked up so it's probably best to call in the morning or early afternoon. Apparently Lid is a very busy salon, and with the success of their Fabfind deal I actually couldn't get a Saturday appointment for several weeks. When the day finally arrived for my 3pm appointment with Angela, I showed up about 10 minutes early and she was able to get started with me right away. The salon itself is located on the second floor of a little building in Yorkville, up a narrow flight of stairs. The decor is pretty simplistic with little to mention in terms of ambiance, and I think the building used to be a house because the salon is divided into all these different rooms. They also do esthetics here so there are nail stations and a reflexology bed and the like. My appointment started off with a brief chat about what I wanted to do with my hair (just a trim with some layers) and then Angela proceeded to wash my hair and give me an invigorating scalp massage. I believe this salon uses Kevin Murphy products for the most part, which I love. Angela wasn't much of a chatter, which was fine by me, although I do wish that she had elicited some more feedback from me such as how I would prefer to have my hair styled after the cut. Overall, I'm satisfied with my haircut and I have no major complaints. However, the regular price for a cut, blowdry and style here ranges from $75 - $110. At that price point, I would expect a lot more than what I received. From my experience, I definitely wouldn't return here if I were paying full price, and I probably wouldn't come back even with a Fabfind offer. I've paid much less than $110 at salons that return your messages, give you reminder phone calls, offer you complimentary beverages and hand massages, and leave you feeling ""fabulous"" and not just ""fine"".",negative
"It is interesting how the reviews of this salon are either really bad (one star) or excellent (almost 5 stars). These ratings reflect the uneven quality and professional experience provided by the hairdressers. Basically you go there and you get that lucky ticket, or you don't. I had a horrible experience with one of the hairdressers. The guy coloured my your hair but I am not sure how much of a colour specialist he is. I am not sure he knew what he was doing. I left the place in shock. The manager was friendly and apologetic for the crappy service I received. I can only speak to My personal experience. To make matters more stressful the music was so loud I don't know how they can work all day listening to the endless bombing of the nauseating music. I would not return to this place.",negative
"Just received the worst hair cut of my life! I would have had better luck diving head-first into a lawn mower. I saw it coming a mile away. For starters, the woman responsible for this hatchet job looked absolutely MISERABLE cutting hair. Stoned? Hungover? Maybe...I gave her a photo booth picture I took of myself a while back for reference. Completely disregarded! Just started snip-snip-snipping away at my beautiful curls. Longer on the top and shorter on the sides turned into shorter all over in a matter of seconds. I look like I have an over grown brush cut with no hope in the world of styling. I was apprehensive about shutting down this operation because that's always embarrassing, so I suffered through it. Big mistake. Finally, when she carelessly lopped off my bangs far above the eyebrows, I lost it. I told her it looked like f*****g s***, to which she told me not to use profanity, stopped cutting, and made me leave. I didn't have to pay, but I still feel ripped off. I should have walked down to queen street and paid a crackhead 5 dollars to cut my hair with a pair of hedge clippers. Guaranteed better results. Every time I look in the mirror, I can't help but cringe at the sight of me. I look like 'simple jack' from the film 'tropic thunder'. Thank god hair grows back. 0 stars.",negative
"As someone who is SO picky with their hair and stylists, this is actually the only place in Toronto I'll go. Sophia is unreal with colour and seems to be the only stylist in the world that knows what a ""trim"" means instead of a cut. Plus this place is pretty cheap. I've sent so many friends to Sophia and everyone raves about her. 5++ stars",positive
"My stylist, Rose, reeked of cigarette smoke all through my cut. It was all I could do to keep from choking. I shall not return.",negative
"Terrible hairdressers with little to no experience! I came here hoping to get my hair trimmed and lighten. It was dark brown almost black and I wanted to get it to a medium brown. What I got was 4inches off my length and blonde, brassy, damaged streaks of blond on the inner front of my hair. Each side was a different color of blonde. She left the black completely dark and charged me full price. When I asked her why she didn't do the back she said it was more money and I would have to come back. The sign on the front says highlights 65 dollars not more. She did not listen to what I wanted at all. I paid an extra 30 dollars to blow-dry my hair and it was plain with no style. RIP Off! They offered to fix my hair for free and now I'm back to where I started dark brown almost black hair with some odd random reddish streaks. I overheard my hair dresser and the manager saying that she screwed it up again and the Manger just said don't worry I have your back. ??? Save your money! Do your own hair before coming here because you could probably do a better job yourself.",negative
"This was one of the worst hair experiences that I have ever had with dying and highlights. The service I had was terrible and the guy who did my hair rushed and did not even have the decency to take colour off my face and my ears. When I first walked in the door, they had a few people in seats getting their hair done but no one sitting down waiting. No one asked me what I would like for about half an hour. I also requested my hair to be styled and straightened, not cut. Once the guy finished dying my hair, he blowed dry ""straight"" my hair. I asked if he could use a flat iron to make it completely straight, not curved inwards, where he then insisted that flat irons were bad for the hair and he did not want to use it on my head. I understand this but as a paying customer, I like having my hair a certain way. He still did not flat iron my hair nor take the colour off my face. He said he had another customer and could not take the extra time and told me that the colour would come off in a few days. I paid the price (180$), and will never be a repeat customer, for this price i expected a much better service, and quality. My hair is pretty short (ear length) and I have been to places that do better service for cheaper prices. (I highly recommend trade secrets in Bloor west village)",negative
"I had my hair cut yesterday and was really happy with everyone there. I went in on a whim at around 2 ish - so I had no appointment, so they slipped me in for the soonest they had open which was 5:00 PM (on a Friday? That's pretty good). I had been weary about other salons because I once inquired with En Vogue and the guy there was absolutely rude and accused me of lying, when all I wanted was a clarification on something one of his employees had said. Way to treat any potential customers! Anyway, so I just wanted some cleaning up, trim the ends a bit and that's it. Maggie washed and blow dried my hair, she was absolutely amazing, I have never seen such a diligent worker. Also best blow dry of my life, she took her time, was really nice, and made my hair look great. Then Patricia took care of the cut, she gave me just a clean up and a slight trip as I didn't want a whole lot chopped off. She did a great job also, and gave me some clean up trims at the front. Overall very happy. I will definitely be going back and already recommended the spot to my cousin. Such pleasant staff!",positive
"I came for a colour correction and came out feeling like a new woman! Within minutes of leaving the store I have received several compliments! Jessica did an amazing job, from asking about my hair history, showing me different options, explaining next steps thoroughly, listening to my request of using cold water and asking if the temperature was to my liking. The place itself is very nice, good music, very comfortable washing stations. All the ladies are nice and hard working. I will definitely come back!",positive
"It's been about 2 weeks since I had my hair done, the fade has settled and I love my hair! I can't stop touching it and playing with it...it both looks and feels really good even after all that processing was done to it. Whatever Alicia did was magic! I made an appointment for a hair cut and a balayage through the online booking system. Most appointments appeared to be booked up about 2 weeks in advance of when I was looking but luckily Alicia had an opening. I was appreciative that the studio does some due diligence on new clients beforehand which was a few questions about hair history and current hair photos. They do this to make sure your hair isn't so over processed that any other work will destroy it, instead of turning you away at the studio. I had some correspondence with the studio to make sure I had booked the correct services for my hair. All of the communications were fast and helpful since I wasn't sure exactly what I needed. As for the actual experience, it couldn't have gone better. Alicia is listed as a new talent but rest assured she's only newer to the studio (as opposed to new at hair) and experienced. I had a goal in mind and showed her a picture of it and she let me know that it would probably take a couple of sessions to get my hair as light as I wanted. No problem, I'd rather take it slow than lose my hair to impatience. We started off with the haircut which I absolutely love. I was getting a lot of length off and there were no problems with the cut; no extra inches off or timidness about cutting it all off. Then came the colouring which was about a 6 hour ordeal. This is where Alicia's amazing personality really came in to play because she's really chill and easy to talk to which made the marathon go by a little faster. We had some help during the process with the salon assistants and Lisa also came by to check on how everything was going. It was really awesome to see that everyone was willing to pitch in and help you get your perfect hair. I'd definitely recommend this studio to anyone that's looking for Instagram-worthy hair. One other bonus is that this studio is surrounded between a Starbucks, a chocolatier, AND a macaron shop so you can set up for a perfect day of pampering. Enjoy ladies!",positive
"I've been looking for a salon to fix my hair for the past year. I've gotten numerous recommendations from friends/colleagues but nothing caught my eye until one of my colleagues recommended Lisa Dinh. I stalked their instagram and was in love with what I saw. I didn't have a preference for a stylist because they all seemed AMAZING. I booked the soonest weekend appointment I could get with any stylist. When the morning of the appointment came, I got a call saying my stylist was sick, however, Lisa and her assistant Rian would be available to do my hair. My hair was previously dyed brown and has since grown out a lot and it turned brassy/super orange. They both did an outstanding job and rescued my hair! Rian began with a consultation and assessed my hair. They really listen to what you want and will tell you what's achievable. I told them I wasn't comfortable going too light. I'm pretty low maintenance/lazy and I wanted something natural but with dimension. They did a colour correction, toned it, added lowlights, blowdried and styled it in 4 hours (it honestly went by so fast!) My total before tip was $339. Although Lisa did my hair with Rian, my appointment was with a new talent stylist and Lisa honoured that pricing. I was so happy with how my hair turned out and when Lisa showed me a picture of my hair, I was shocked and couldn't believe that it was really my hair! I've gotten so many compliments; I'm addicted and I can't wait to return in a couple of months and go even lighter! Atmosphere: It's sleek, modern, and busy in there. You can tell that the girls are like one big family. They joke, they laugh, and they have fun while maintaining professionalism and quality work. Lisa, as the owner, is also very hands on with the work - wiping down mirrors, sweeping hair etc. She's always checking up on the girls and clients just to see if everything is going well. It's great to see that in a business owner and you can tell she is truly passionate about her business.",positive
"I went in for a hair appointment not really knowing what to except, I have seen all the pics from their Instagram page and was confident I made the right choice to get my hair done here. I have previous gone to a different salon which always did a good job on my hair but due to the colour I wanted this time I wanted to try a salon I knew would get the job done. When I walked into the salon I was greeted by Lisa who is such a doll, she took my jacket for me and gave me a robe to protect my clothes. I had booked an appointment with Yorsiny who happens to be amazing at her job and goes above and beyond to make her clients happy. Upon starting the session I advance I wanted to go with a grey/silver tone but due the fact that my hair originally is black it may not be attainable because I would need to be super blonde. She advised me it may not be possible which I understood and just stated would like to go lighter either way. 5 hours in the chair and with help with Rian my hair turned out better then what I excepted, I was able to get the grey tone that I wanted and I am super in love with my hair colour now. Not only were the women working there amazing but the atmosphere and the environment of the salon is just very inviting, I will def be coming back in the future to have all my hair need meet from the beautiful and talented women from this salon.",positive
"Current update... been my go to salon for the past 2 years and that has NOT changed. My favorite hair stylists are still Olivia with the addition of Kathy now. Recently went in for an overdue appointment, had never tried fashion colour before and Kathy did not disappoint! Got a ton of compliments and I love it and would do it again.",positive
"I've been a long time customer of Lisa's studio and every penny spent here is worth it. Always book in advance so you have a spot! Since going here I've had Lisa, Olivia, Jessica, Aaron, Yorsiny and April assist/cut/dye my hair. I would recommend any members!",positive
Kathy Tran was great! Love my color. Everyone was really friendly and Kathy lightened my hair without damaging it. Really happy with how it turned out!,positive
"I have dark brown asian hair with medium-fine texture. It's all virgin and it goes down to my mid back. I booked with Jessica and we went with beige blonde babylights while leaving my roots natural. The process took 3.5 hours from beginning to end - foils, wash, tone, wash, blow dry and style. I am thrilled with the overall experience and outcome. I knew I'd go lighter but was still surprised at how light Jessica was able to get me! The cost of everything was $280 before tips. I expected this price - you get what you pay for: assurance and quality! Everyone was very friendly and Lisa is very personal and attentive, despite being the owner. She walked by and saw some colour on my face and wiped it off for me, asked me if I wanted a refill for my tea and more. Notes/recommendations: - shop for your shampoos (Jessica recommended: Loreal silver shampoo, Joico purple shampoo and Shimmer lights purple shampoo...but keep in mind I am not trying to maintain grey hair. If you're going grey, go with Fanola purple shampoo) before your appointment so that you're not scrambling afterwards. - Buy a wet brush! (the brand ""Wet brush Pro"" is amazing) And buy a detangler. I was quite surprised how tangled my hair became when it got wet, despite it being quite smooth when dry. - Buy your shampoos and brushes from Winners..they have an abundance of Joico products and they are the cheapest. - Maintaining your hair will be $$ and effort! Products alone could add up to another $100",positive
"I've been here three times and all three times I've had excellent experiences. The girls were really knowledgeable and knew what they were doing. Very pricey but then again, it is your hair and what you pay is what you get. The overall health of my hair would have been much worst at a cheaper salon (and after three appointments, my hair is still pretty healthy!). My hair also turned out exactly how I wanted during each session. I am so looking forward to my next visit!",positive
"Thank-you Samantha for doing an amazing job with my hair. Also, thank-you for being so kind and patient. I was a little late and I came sweating! But you approached my hair as if I wasn't sweating my soul out (it was really hot and I walked from Dupont station.. lol). I love my hair so much - I've only coloured my hair twice before at other salons and both times before I left feeling pretty disappointed.. BUT NOT THIS TIME AROUND. I LOVE MY HAIR SO MUCH. THANK-YOU SAMANTHA! YOU WERE AMAZING!!! I saw on facebook just now that Samantha will be leaving the salon soon which makes me sad because I was looking forwards to seeing her again to touch up my hair in the future. :( But as I was looking around the salon today, I'm sure I will be in great hands with the others working at LIsa DInh's. Everyone was so friendly and everyone's hair was amazinggggggg wow! :') thanks again for making me look so good!!!!!!",positive
"This was my first experience with Lisa's studio. I came across them on instagram and have been on the look out for a hair salon that was able to achieve an extremely cool toned ashy blonde/ almost silver tone on dark black hair which is often difficult to achieve. Every hair colourist who I found that I took a liking to their work was from California- That is until I came across Lisa's page. I looked at all of the staff members' pages and decided Olivia was my choice. I booked 4 months in advance and finally got my hair done earlier this week. I cannot be happier with my hair colour. I can say I've never walked out of a hair appointment thrilled-but that has changed. As expensive as this place this, I've found my new colourist. She spent 5 hours on my hair and was well attended to. If you're concerned about the price, all I can say is, there is a reason why you don't often see hair colour as beautifully done as this on the streets everyday. The way Olivia blended/ achieved the blonde and super ashy silver tones in my hair just from one session pleasantly surprised me. I showed Olivia a picture of the colour I wanted and she explained to me that I'd have to do a few more sessions to achieve it, which I understand. Although the balayage ombré I ended up with looks different from the picture I showed her- I'm 100% okay with that because they're artists and one artist will put their own unique spin on their piece of work, which is what she did and it looks fantastic. I also knew I wanted to purchase the right products to properly maintain the colour and expressed to Olivia that I was looking for products. She made sure to write down the products she'd recommends and didn't push to sell my the products in the studio which I appreciate. I ended up getting one of their purple shampoos and going to out and purchasing the recommended shampoo and conditioner that I can use on a more frequent basis. Before I went to my first appointment, I'd already booked my second because of the long wait list, which is okay with me. I'd ask seen Olivia's work and trusted her so I was pretty positive I'd be happy with the results. I received so many compliments on my hair. I couldn't be happier!",positive
"Wow.. Where do I even begin? I have never felt more horrified, upset, and belittled in my entire salon-going life. Ladies, please spend your hard earned money ELSEWHERE. I sat in the stylist, Jessica's chair for 5 hrs while both her and the SALON OWNER, LISA, not only made fun of my shampooing habits, but openly threw insulting jokes about my hair's reaction to the bleach for the entire time they were bleaching my hair. (3 hrs long...) Jessica never asked for my name or offered a glass of water for the entire visit. I closed my eyes for portions of the visit and instead of politely saying, ""excuse me"", she POKED me to get me to the rinsing station. The salon is dirty dusty, and dumpy- looks like they just gave up on cleaning after the grand opening. I finished my sandwich and was crinkling my garbage. The stylists noticed me looking around for a garbage can and never bothered to show me one. I ended up tossing it on the table myself. For a salon who is so friendly on social media, you sure are a bunch of miserable bullies who think too highly of yourselves. Honestly, you're just hair stylists, not Jesus walking on the Nile River. Take note, ladies: do not come unless you're the type that enjoys being insulted and treated like dirt.",negative
"Jess did such an amazing job, everything was perfect and she was the sweetest! Their team was also very helpful and friendly throughout the process. I was a little hesitant at first since I've always had trust issues with people working on my hair, but she ensured everything was what I wanted and the end result was exactly how I pictured it would be. Can't thank her enough for the beautiful job she's done, will definitely be going back :)",positive
Sam did a great job my in hair. She was super attentive and so were everyone else at the salon. They're like a little family and they're so excellent when it comes to customer service. I loved it so much. Everyone is so friendly and nice. I will be a lifetime customer from now on!!!' Highly recommend them. Lisa and her team are beyond awesome,positive
"I stumbled upon Lisa's instagram a couple years ago and booked my first session with her in December of 2015. My first session with her was in her at-home salon and let me tell you - she was humble and kind then, and she is still humble and kind now. Her hard work and passion really shows. You aren't JUST a client to her, you're more than that. I've had my hair done by Lisa, Olivia, and my previous 2 sessions have been with Jess. They all really value their clients and put in 110%. They take their time with you and are very honest with you (ex: number of sessions it may take to achieve your desired colour). It might take a couple hours to get your hair done but you truly get what you pay for (bring your laptop, theres free wifi). It's amazing looking at the progress Lisa has made with her studio, what started off with just her has now grown into a small team of talented hairstylists! I'm gonna be getting my hair done by them even when i'm an old lady with grey hairs and a walking stick :)",positive
"I'm going to start off my review by saying I literally have nothing but good things to say about this salon! I came with my best friend to get our hair done for our vacation. We both got balayage highlights and asked for low maintenance colouring. My natural hair is jet black and on top of that I dyed my hair with black box dye, which created more difficulty. I showed my stylist (Sam Mcgin) what I wanted to achieve but I said it was okay if it was not achievable, considering what I've done to my hair in the past. After a 5 hour session I walked out of that salon with the biggest smile on my face because Sam's work exceeded my expectations! I will definitely come back to Lisa Dinh's studio for future touch ups and colouring! Everyone there was welcoming and passionate about their work which was so nice to see! I'm not the type to spend too much money on my hair but for the service and results that I got from this salon, it was worth every dollar!!",positive
"I am so happy I stumbled across Lisa's instagram page back in 2014!! Since then I have visited her home and new studio I think 5 times total for colour/cut and I am so so so glad I went through my hair journey with them. They're friendly, helpful, and I never felt rushed during the consultation process. I first did a balayage highlights with Olivia when I still had years of brown box dye in my hair, and worked up my courage to do a full on blonde balayage ombre with Lisa before leaving to study abroad. I was really shocked at how light the blonde was, so Lisa offered to tone it darker within the week if I didn't like it (but I ended up loving it!) When I came back, I did a touch up and toned darker with Olivia and have had touch up toners/haircuts with Samantha in the past half year as I transition back to my natural brown-black roots. Aaron is also great at assisting! I truly feel that no matter who I was able to squeeze in an appointment with, they all displayed amazing attention to detail and I am always thankful they are patient enough to deal with my super thick hair lol. It's pretty awesome to see their team grow over the years and I'm confident that all future salon staff will meet your expectations to the best of their ability. If you have a style in mind, make sure you have done your research and bring in examples for reference of what you want your hair to look like, as well as less ""dramatic"" back-ups in case that level of bleaching etc. just isn't possible for your hair. If they decline to do your particular request, just know it's the best decision for your hair health at this point! A tiny drawback for me is just how busy they are - book way in advance if you want colouring services but if you're just looking for a drop-in cut this is probably not for you since pretty much all of the staff specialize in colouring.",positive
"Everythint about my experience at this salon was amazing. As someone with thick wavy hair, its always been a challenge to find someone to do my hair well. However, at lisadinhs this was not the case. From the moment I walked in, I was offered muffins, conversation and someone to take my coat away. As a sat in the chair, my colourist/stylist, who was Olivia, listened to what I wanted done (ash beige balayage highlights), she asked it I had any pictures and recreated the whole thing. She is a very sweet girl and it was very enjoyable to talk to her throughout the process. At the end, when she was styling my hair she also allowed me to show her a pic of the way I wanted it done (tousled beach waves) and without a doubt she was able to recreate that too. The final product was amazing. Olivia also explained how to maintain my ash hair and offered me multiple product choices that I could buy, which was very appreciated. Also- In the process of my hair session, despite the fact that I wasn't booked with Lisa, she greeted herself to me and kept asking me if everything was going alright/if I needed anything. I thought this was a very sweet and warming touch as she is the owner and was busy with another client but she still made the time to make sure my experience went well. Overall, I am so happy with my hair and the experience here. This was my first time here but I will definitely be coming back.",positive
"I had my hair cut and coloured by Samantha couple of weeks ago (Dec. 16). The Good: First of all, I loved how friendly the salon was. Everyone was welcoming. Samantha was also very nice and easy to talk to. Samantha did an AMAZING job with colouring my hair. I told her what I wanted (natural with some lighter brown highlights/balayage) and she did exactly that. She kept checking in to make sure that the lightening was going okay. She never complained about how much hair I had (I have lots of thick hair) and was very pleasant throughout the whole process. I have received many compliments when my hair is curled. The not as good: I wasn't as happy with my hair cut. I didn't realize how odd my hair looked from the back when it's straight till a week after my hair cut (when someone made a comment about it). I specifically requested for a hair cut that looked good straight or curled and right now, it only looks curled. Since she is the professional, I completely trusted her when she said it would look better more blunt and not thinned out so that I have more volume. And for most people that's probably true. But because I have straight and thick hair, my hair looks quite messy with the blunt cut. I will post a photo from the back. Also, my bangs are brighter in colour than the rest of my hair... I told her near the beginning that I like side swept bangs and also that I like having lighter colours to frame my face. I guess I should have clarified that that does noT include my bangs... Will I go back? Heck yes! I will recommend this place for balayage and hair colour! I still love the colour of my hair for the most part. But next time, I will likely get it cut somewhere else beforehand.",positive
"I really wanted to love this place after researching so many hair salons and their portfolios. When I got there, no one was around to greet me. After awkwardly sitting down, I waited for Olivia to come - I showed pictures of subtle balayage but she said I should go for something lighter. I insisted I did not want to look like the typical brunette blonde - anyway, at the end it looked like that. I still trusted her because she is the professional here. During the process, I felt she wasn't friendly and brushed my hair very roughly - to the point where my hair was elasticky and breaking. We all know that our hair's at its weakest when it's 1) wet and 2) after chemical processing. Lisa helped brushed out my hair as well but she was definitely gentle and patient with my hair, taking her time and not yanking out knots. In the end, I wasn't happy with my colour, so Olivia ended up putting a toner on for a bit and I left with happier colour but with broken hair. I know that this salon has a policy where you can go back and have them fix anything you want free if you're not satisfied, but I didn't want to risk getting my hair in even worse shape. Oops I almost forgot to mention, my hair went back to being light after 2 weeks...... I did not brush my hair for atleast 2 weeks, especially when it was wet, any slight tugging would rip the strands. To be honest, i was really scared. I had to do hair treatments every day for the next 3 weeks and lots of olaplex at another salon, and had them correct my hair colour as well. I regret to write this review and I know some ppl have their bad days at their job, but if you're passionate about your work, your mood shouldn't get in the way of quality work. I warned many friends from coming here thereafter and suggested the other salon which actually fixed my hair. ------------------ Thanks Lisa, I appreciate your feedback. During the consultation, I was asked when it was the last time I had my hair coloured. I get annual straightening perm done followed by hair colouring and highlights for many many years now. I did not mention the perm because I was i) not asked about it, and ii) it did not cross my mind that it would be an issue. Yes, it was a miscommunication, and I know these things can happen. Please understand that I didn't want to come back to fix my hair because I could not have taken another risk right before my wedding. I know you work hard at your shop and you want the best representation of it. I also really wanted to believe that because it puts me at stake. Regardless of what happened, thank you for your reply and kind concern.",negative
"After having a bad experience in another salon earlier in the year (note my other review LOL) my bf got me an appointment with Lisa Dinh! My hair before was over processed, banded and pretty brassy.. You can tell Lisa knows what she is doing and she warned me before starting that my hair was very damaged and we might now be able to achieve the look I wanted. Nonetheless, my hair actually reacted pretty well and we finished my hair in about 4-5 hours! My hair has no yellow what's so ever and it is BLENDED like a dream! Another thing I loved was that despite her having another client, she still constantly checked up on me to make sure I was okay and to see how the process was going. I am super happy with my hair and get compliments daily about it. Thanks Lisa!!",positive
"I had my hair done with Sam at the studio and it was a pretty awesome experience! Everyone is really friendly in the salon and even though I'm pretty shy, I ended up chatting with them :) my hair looks gorgeous and I can't thank Sam enough for the unicorn hair. (Dyed it a grey/pink mix) Sam was great - she asked me about my hair history and then went over how she'd be doing my hair. Not only that, she would explain each step as she started them and I really loved that. She offered me tea/water many a times which was sweet and even offered to help pick me up some food since I hadn't eaten that day :) One thing I particularly love about the studio was that it was really clean and designed very nicely. Not only that, the salon wasn't packed. Even though they are always booked up, they really care about their clients and try to ensure that quality is given for each one by ensuring they aren't booked to too many different people. I've been too many salons and half the time the stylist is working on 3 other girls/guys so this was really a big surprise! I love that everyone seems so down to earth :) Everyone also has really great looking hair their which is always a good sign I personally think! I kept staring at Lisa because her hair colour was just so pretty! Aaron assisted and he was really friendly as well! Styled my hair really nicely and the head massage was Overall, my experience was a really good one. I went in with high expectations and came out very satisfied. Normally I come out of the salon feeling disappointed but this was the one time I didn't :) I just wish I could snag appointments easier :( either way, don't hesitate to book an appointment!",positive
I had my hair recently dyed by Lisa and she did an amazing job. I always wanted the ashy blonde balayage and she recreated the exact colour I wanted in a picture I showed her. Lisa took the time to fix up the previous dyed job I had and gave me a brand new look. Her assistant Aaron was also very personable and gave a great hair wash with a massage. Thanks for everything!,positive
"It was my first time at the salon and I've been browsing on Instagram the work that is done at the salon. I've always wanted to come in and experience it myself, so I finally did and I was completely happy and satisfied. Jessica was truly amazing and talented for someone with one year of experience. I truly trusted her and with the results I got, I loved it! By far the best salon I've ever been to.",positive
"I've been anticipating a chance to have my hair done by Lisa for quite some time, but she was based in Mississauga when I discovered her work, but when she opened her salon in Toronto I was trilled! I just recently had my hair cut and coloured my Lisa her self and I could not be any more happier with how it turned out. I did have a different colour style that I intentionally wanted but i trusted Lisa to do what she does best and allow her to colour my hair how she felt would suit my hair and the colour treatments I had done before. The salon itself is easy to find and its very clean and classy. I would recommend any girl looking to have her hair done professionally to book with Lisa! She is very busy and always booked for months so you do have to keep in mind that your going to be booking for months ahead. She also brought her cute adorable puppy Toby to the salon! I enjoyed his presence and so did my boyfriend who came along with me. Follow her on Insta @lisadinhhairstudio to check out her work and salon! I admire her work and passion for what she does girl power!",positive
"Lisa Dinh Hair Studio does not disappoint! From the overall friendliness of girls at the salon & assistant, knowledgeable colorists, to the fantastic results, these girls are the best. I've gone twice, recommended them numerous times and will definitely be a returning customer!",positive
"My first time going to the studio and it was amazing! Lisa was the first to greet me and she was super nice and welcoming. The studio's beautiful and a great open space so you can see how they work with other clients. I was referred to this hair salon by a friend who had her balayage done by Olivia. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to schedule a balayage early because their schedule is fully booked! However, I was able to schedule a wash and style with Olivia. Chau, who handles all their appointments, was really quick in replying and was able to book me an appointment for a balayage for a later date. When I met Olivia, she asked me what I wanted for my hair. I explained that I really needed a haircut however it wasn't part of the booking. But Olivia made it happen! She was able to squeeze a haircut, wash and styling within 30 minutes. She's quick and amazing! She also asked me about my hair and past dye jobs so I felt that she really wanted to know what my hair's gone through After creeping on their Instagram and finally experiencing it first hand, I can understand now why it takes months to get a booking. It was well worth the wait!",positive
"After years of stalking Lisa on Instagram (@lisadinhhairstudio) and seeing her share her work/hair transformations online, I was finally able to have a hair transformation of my own! I've wanted to color my hair with Lisa for such long time so when I heard that she was opening her own salon in Toronto I was super excited! I immediately booked my appointment online around February and to my surprise Lisa was already booked for almost 3 months! I decided to wait it out and booked a balayage ombre session with her for early May ...and let me tell you SHE IS WORTH THE WAIT. Lisa was super nice and friendly upon my arrival to the salon. Before she started coloring my hair she asked me about my hair history (ie. previous dyes/box dyes) and what I wanted to do with my hair. She was really easy to talk to and thoroughly listened to what I wanted. To make it easier for her, I also showed her some pictures of the color I wanted! My main goal for the session was to get rid of my brassy ends and get it as light and ashy as possible. My general expectations for the session was quite low. My hair was quite damaged and I had Asian hair so I thought the lightest I would see my hair after the blow dry would be a nice caramel/brown ombre and that I would need a couple more sessions before I could achieve a nice ashy tone....but Lisa surprised me and exceeded my expectations!!! Lisa worked her magic and got me to beautiful ashy tones!! I was so pleased and happy with the results I couldn't believe my eyes!! The difference from the before and after is huge and I am ever so grateful for Lisa. The session took about 4 hours because I had shorter hair. Overall, I would definitely recommend Lisa. She is very professional and knows exactly what she is doing. I have received so many compliments on my hair and have told all my friends and family about her salon and they have looked into booking with her and the other stylists. Lisa is the best in Toronto and she will be the only one I trust with my hair. I will definitely be a long time client and be coming back :)",positive
"I've had my hair done by both Lisa and Olivia. They both do an amazing job, they work with you and if you have hair goals they help you achieve it, but are realistic. They never lie to you, and if they can't do something or it'll take multiple sessions they'll tell you. Which I think is great, because you need stylists who are honest with you. They ask new clients lots of questions on their hair history. Don't lie! Be honest! They can't give you what you want unless you tell them the truth! Check out their instagrams, you'll see the works of art they create. Lisa is also expanding and hiring more stylists. Anyone who Lisa hires will be amazing, so you can't go wrong with whoever you book with. You won't be disappointed. You can also get your brows and nails done by Janny. She's a miracle worker. One of the best and friendliest places to get your hair done in Toronto. You'll love it!",positive
"best hair salon everrr! i went to lisa before she opened up the salon and i gotta say that she's the best hair colorist i've ever been to. not only that, but she cares so much about her clients and the work she does is amazing! 10/10 will go back!",positive
"As others have stated Mary is the best! I moved here almost 9 years ago and spent the first 6 going from one FH salon to the next. Then...I found Mary!! Best cut I have ever had. She is patient and so nice to chat with. After she opened up her salon I found her again and absolutely love her. She now does my color and eyebrows in addition to cut and style and has been flawless. We did a semi ombré thing last time and not only did I love it, but received tons of compliments and Scottsdale friends asking for my colorist. I have to mention that I really like the home salon feel, not intimidating whatsoever, and her adorable dog Betty is so sweet. Writing this reminds me I am due for a cut.",positive
"I have a lot of hair. It's curly, and I am always skeptical to try someone new. Well, it was time. I've lived here for over a year, and I couldn't keep waiting to visit home for my long, overdue haircuts. Mary Hatch Peters has been a true blessing. She listens to what style you would like to achieve, and she takes her time to ensure it is done to perfection. I believe she is actually the best stylist I have ever had. I truly can't imagine being happier with anyone else. From start to finish, she exceeds five star service. I would highly recommend her whether you are new to town or just in need of a change. She is excellent.",positive
"I'd been going to my regular hair stylist in Scottsdale for many, many years - and after much soul searching, decided to make a change and find someone new, in Fountain Hills, where I live. Not only did Mary come VERY highly recommended by so many people I know and/or know of, but I had already used her styling services a couple months previously for a friend who was having some post-wedding pictures taken, as my gift to them. She made my friend look and feel gorgeous, so I already knew I'd be in good hands! She listened very carefully to what I wanted, made additional recommendations, spent a great deal of time with multiple steps...and not only did I walk out with the best cut and color that I've had in years, but we have a tangible plan as we continue to grow out what I had before and move towards what I really want! Her space is spotless, she is charming and thoughtful - and I always appreciate any place where my dog(s) is/are welcome! She is, quite simply...the best!",positive
"Mary's been my stylist for a little over two years and I couldn't be happier. She's thorough, knowledgable, and so much fun to banter with (an important quality when you spend hours in someone's chair!). She took my hair from dark brown to blonde with no damage. She's brilliant with cuts, as well. Whether you need a trim, a dramatic cut, or a change of color, she's the best stylist I've ever had. As Homer Simpson would say... 9 thumbs up!",positive
"Discovered Mary from one of my FB Groups - you know, you're looking for someone local and do that shout-out to your FB friends. Mary came highly recommended. I've been once and really did like her. It was a simple trim, but I was ready to (gasp) add bangs and she helped talk me through it. She's super nice and listened to me as I explained what I wanted, and showed her some photos. We talked through the pros and cons before I decided to go with it. She started me out with just a little bit and I went back a week later and added some more (at no charge). The space is clean. She's super nice. I'm a fan and have my follow up trim scheduled for next week!",positive
"I do very much love going here. I love going to Mikee, The Scottish Guy. He always gives me the best haircuts. He takes his time and listen to what i am looking for. His Hot Towel Shaves are great too. I also love seeing Anka, the owner as she always puts a smile on my face. Thanks Mankind for keeping looking great...",positive
"Michael ""The Scottish Guy"" is the best!!! He has been cutting my hair since November 2016 and I leave extremely happy every time.",positive
"This brings me no pleasure. I was a walk in, being in town and being long overdue for a shave and a haircut, I decided to treat myself. Everyone was very nice, and the shop looked fun. I noted the shave was a luxury service that was advertised at taking 45 minutes. I asked if we could cut some of the luxury time as I didn't want to spend and hour at the salon. They agreed. They assured me corners wouldn't be cut (pun intended), just that they wouldn't do every step of the spa like treatment. I would pay regular price, I assured them, of course. The gentlemen who cut my hair was well groomed, and smelled good and very nice. I'm sure no one wants to be that close to someone who smells bad or has bad breath. But here's the real issue. The services rendered were not only NOT worth the money they were charging, money I'd gladly pay for quality service. It was incompetent. The shave. The shave was the worst. My father is an old school barber, and a straight-razor shaves should take 15-20 minutes for a full beard, max. With all corners cut, this stylist still took 45 minutes, and the shave was not a shave. He wielded the blade and moved it like he didn't know what he was doing. He shaved in small, hesitant moves that were uncomfortable. And because I didn't have my glasses and didn't look into a close mirror after all was said and done, I didn't notice at the time that it was barely a shave. There was not a patch of skin that didnt have some growth on it and many patches of...ugh, look, suffice it to say I had to shave again. The haircut itself was much better being only sub par. Meaning that I had to walk him through a standard short back and sides, slightly longer on top, tighter in the back. A standard ""Mad Men"" style cut that should be easy for someone who knows what he's doing. I touched up some missed strands here and there myself, and will have to get another cut in a couple of weeks. So, avoid.",negative
"Walked in, very friendly atmosphere. Tried something new and got more. Shout out to Michael for giving me an awesome chop.",positive
"It's been a while since I started coming here. It has a lot of thumbs up! It has great atmosphere, the people are cool and kind and they do a great job. The waiting lounge is quite comfy, although I've never waited more than 15 minutes. With the haircut it includes a nice shampooing with hair and facial massage. They used to do also an amazing hand massage too, which included cold wax that left them feeling as fresh and new as a baby's one might feel... they don't do it anymore. My hair is done by my good friend Nia, who is great, cheerful and we always have an awesome conversation. I also do my pedi and manicure with Toni, who is great too. Besides the good job and exciting conversation she always has good anecdotes to tell me. The only down is the price is (waaaay) expensive. I would also advise on getting an appointment.",positive
"Mankind is awesome. I see Kyle there who is unreal. If you're a guy and are looking for someone who knows how to cut a good and trendy man's cut, you gotta go see him! Check out his instagram account @london_fades. He's a great dude and gives a 10/10 hair cut. Really puts in the time to give a meticulous fade and quality cut.",positive
"Finding a stylist that puts time and effort into your hair is rare these days. I have been to many grooming salons for men and I can say that Mankind is my place now. I travel 45mins from outside the GTA to get my hair cut just because they do it right. Ruth is awesome, she really pays attention to detail and she can tame my curly hair. I would highly recommend this place to all those that value their image.",positive
"Very negative experience. No respect for people's time. I left work early and took a cab to be on time for my appointment. Upon arrival, no one informed me of a delay. 10 minutes after my scheduled appointment I asked what was going on. I was told that there was a slight delay. I left 30 minutes later without a haircut, disappointed that no one had even alluded to it, nor apologized or tried to make things right. Very negative customer experience.",negative
God a giftcard and based on Yelp reviews got a haircut from Tash. She was very friendly and paid a lot of attention to details Overall a good experience,positive
I had been looking for somewhere to get a haircut and straight razor shave since moving to town a year ago. I tried a few others but they don't come close to Mankind. I get the Alpha Male package and straight razor shave with Loraine. The haircut is great - I even got comments at work - and the shave is baby smooth. Combined with the hand and scalp massages I always come out feeling great. Highly recommended.,positive
I decided to go to this place on a whim and I'm happy I did. Tash did an amazing job with my hair. I could tell that she put a lot of thought into it and my hair came out looking incredible! I was a little apprehensive about the extra spa treatment stuff but it was definitely worth it. It was so relaxing after a long day in class. All in all this place is definitely worth the extra cash. I plan on becoming a regular.,positive
"Simply worth every penny. It's a great space, the people were great, and it just seemed very organized and professional. $45 is steep for a simple cut, but it's not a simple cut. It's nice to be pampered a little bit, and the paraffin wax treatment, hand and arm massage and mini facial were quite relaxing. My stylist (Caleb), though not much of a conversationalist, was on another level skill-wise - he really knows how to shape men's hair. Highest praise.",positive
Great cut. Great service. I will definitely be a regular here. Justin was my barber - a great guy with haircutting talent to boot.,positive
"I hadn't heard about this salon until I received complimentary Alpha-male haircut package in a gift bag I received at an event. I was eager to try this place out as I had been getting $15 haircuts at another location that were rushed and never to my satisfaction. I registered for my appointment online and decided to book an appointment with 'Tash'. I'm very happy I did... Not only was she extremely friendly, but she was extremely detail oriented. The paraffin wax treatment, the facial, and the head massage were all perfect. She spent a lot of time on detailing the fade of my hair, and took her time with the cut. Time went by fast as she seemed to enjoy chatting with me, and made me feel very comfortable. After everything was done I was amazed by how great my hair looked. You know how sometimes you get a haircut and feel a little off because you look ""different"".. Tash was able to tailor my hairstyle so that worked with my face, and balanced all my features... I've been getting compliments every day since my haircut and I honestly would never have expected to feel this good from a haircut. It gets better too... They give you a complimentary neck trim after two weeks... I was spending about $20 every three weeks for a mediocre haircut.. Now I'll only have to get a haircut every 5-6 weeks considering how well my haircut is growing out. At the end of the day, I'm paying around the same as I would have been before, except I'm getting a extremely higher quality cut. Check out this salon... You'll be glad you did.",positive
"I have no problem paying more for higher quality goods and services. There's some things that are really worth a higher price. At Mankind, I paid about twice what I can pay for a really good haircut at a few other places in Toronto, outside the downtown core. So, what am I paying extra for at Mankind? They include a paraffin wax treatment, which is nice, but I probably wouldn't really feel like I need every time I get my hair cut. You get a warm towel face treatment. I don't know what else to call it. It's another inclusion that feels slightly pampering, but that I wouldn't say is a must-have for a haircut. I've come to appreciate the simpler experiences. Ultimately, I pay more at Mankind, and the last few times, haven't even come out with a haircut I was altogether happy with. And that's what I went in for in the first place...",negative
"This is an upscale, no-holds-barred haircuttery that's a little more hipster than jock, despite the masculine aura. But that's a good thing. For me the best part is a hairdresser who actually listens to what you want. They have a short but purposeful ""consultation"" before each cut, where you actively share your preferences. I'm kind of picky, but also quiet, and don't like making a fuss, so lazy hairdressers usually do whatever they like. Caleb is a nice, straight-faced Irish guy with terrific attention to detail and he asks lots of questions about what I want, which is great. I found the atmosphere a little stiff and the prices a little steep, but I'm happy to call myself a loyal customer now, based on the supreme service and quality.",positive
"Wow! I arrived here this morning at 1pm and they were busy so I booked an appointment for 3pm. 3pm - Walked in and they gave me some lotion for my hands then dipped it in wax While I was getting my hair shampoo'd, one of the ladies there gave a hand massage. After the shampoo, they give your head a massage and then a facial massage. Whatever they put on your face feels amazing and it's great to have someone massaging your face while the other is massaging your hands (don't know if this happens always or it was just good timing). Hair cut was amazing - I have longer hair for a guy and explained that most barber shops screw it up by making it too short. My hairdresser here (Caleb I think is his name) said that he has been cutting girls hair for 10 years so he's good with long hair. Overall excellent job on the haircut and exactly what I asked for!!! I also got my beard trimmed. This place is a little expensive compared to regular hair cutting spots that I'm used to in the city ($20) and I ended up paying $65 (cut, wash, and beard trim) and giving a 25% tip so it was $80. Well worth it!",positive
"Due to my profession I can find myself traveling for long periods of time. Sometimes a haircut is required while on the road. This place was right near the top of Yelps list of suggested Mens Salons. Upon entering, I was greeted with a smile, and as a walk in only had to wait about 15 minutes to get a cut. The front lounge was quite comfortable and there was an extremely large TV with sports on. When my stylist came to greet me and take me to her station, I began to describe the trim I was after. For some time now I have been looking for something new and really like input from the stylist about what they would suggest. A strong factor that does not give this Salon a 5 star rating is the fact they had absolutely not books of sample haircuts. This is the first time I have asked if they have a book of sample cuts and was told ""no we don't"". As a male, we only have a few real options for cuts, and seeing what you can be offered on a book seems like a pretty basic thing a salon for men should have. The cut that I left with was absolutely to my satisfaction, although it didn't offer that ""new look"" I've been searching for. If you are wanting something special changed about your hair or are looking for something extremely specific, make sure to show up with your own pictures. I was also impressed with the amount of detail the stylist paid to cleaning up any remaining hairs lingering around on my neck.",positive
"I'm writing this not as someone who has ever had a service from Mankind (obviously), but as someone who sends her man to the studio and has always been happy with the results. My fiancé is very low-maintenance, and for the first couple years of dating he would continue to visit the barber that he has been seeing for the large majority of his life whenever he was in need of a trim. When he made the move downtown to live with me, he realized it was going to get harder and harder to get out to Etobicoke to see a barber with limited weekend hours, and he would let his hair grow to unmanageable lengths while he tried to figure out a time that worked best for everyone. Enter Mankind. From the get-go, they made him feel super comfortable, even though the idea of going to a salon admittedly weirded him out. The vibe is comfortable and classy, with overside leather chairs, punchy artwork, and a large flat-screen TV in the waiting area. The music is quite loud, but the it keeps the energy up. We have never waited long for him to get in for an appointment, and each stylist he's seen (he's not picky) has made sure they're very clear on what he wants before they even begin anything. The first time around he turned down the parrafin wax treatment and the face toner, but quickly warmed up to the idea when he realized that yes, he could in fact do with a bit of pampering. When he leaves, he always looks so debonair and smells amazing. I have no idea what kind of product they use, but I couldn't stop smelling his hair and face after his last visit. I'm just so grateful to have found a place that he is comfortable with, is reasonably priced, and conveniently located near work. He will definitely be back, probably in less than 2 weeks for his complimentary touch-up. I only wish that $45 got me that many services when I get my hair done!",positive
"I have been to the Eglinton location twice now, the first time gets 5 stars, the more recent gets 1, so that averages a 3. Save you the story, but my cut near closing time was rushed, the stylist distracted, and confusion over the cost with not a hint of apology from the receptionist. I have been in touch with them since and they've agreed to make things right, so good on the owner for that. Really depends on your stylist I guess. The ""Alpha Male"" package comes to $50 and change, and in my opinion is a good value.",negative
"I REFUSE to give this butcher shop even a one star review but I had no choice because it wouldn't let me post review otherwise!!! ABSOLUTELY HORRENDOUS! I bought my husband a TeamBuy voucher for the 'alpha male with man hands (wash, cut, style, hot towel, head/hand massage, with paraffin and manicure'. The appointment was booked for 3:45 pm. First problem is that the Richmond St. W location is a cross between a gay Mexican nightclub and 'A Night at the Roxbury' movie. They were even literally playing the soundtrack to 'A Night at the Roxbury'. Second problem was, as I said my husband's appointment was booked for 3:45 pm and NO ONE TENDED TO HIM until AFTER 5:00 pm. How DARE you book someone and not provide the service for close to 1 1/2 hours AFTER their scheduled appointment! BAD BUSINESS PRACTICE! THIRD and MOST IMPORTANT - the MORON who was cutting his hair, the butcher - I mean barber, had the STUPIDITY and IGNORANCE to grab my husband's hair at the root on the TOP of his head and cut it COMPLETELY OFF! Not only did he not ask first but he then turned to my husband and asked ""if it was ok?!?!"". It seems this barber got his schooling on YouTube!! Note: my husband usually wears his hair on the top of his head at 3 inches in length. Not 1/4 of an inch. Needless to say after this jerk-off cut a HUGE chunk out there was NO solution other than for him to basically give my husband a military/police style hair cut/buzz cut!!! My husband was so humiliated and furious that as SOON as the hair butchering was done he left immediately without saying a word. He did not stay for any of the other services offered in the package. Let me tell you, if I was there and this A**hole did that to my husband in front of me, someone would be humilated and hurting more than my husband!! I am BEYOND livid with this CHOP SHOP and not only plan on speaking with the manager and owner, but I have filed a complaint with the BBB and TeamBuy! STAY AWAY FROM THIS BUTCHER SHOP!!!!!",negative
"This place is awesome. So i'm bald and don't have the need for a haircut. My problem is, I have bad bad feet, and after a trip to NY, or with wear and tear, my feet get bad and uncomfortable, and a pedicure fixes that. Except most places you go to, half ass it, and just do a cosmetic pedicure. It cost $30, but Emma who was taking care of me, spent an honest to god, hour and 20 minutes fixing my feet up. No extra charge, no complaints, no half ass job. The best pedicure I've had. Some girls I knew were jealous that they couldn't go there. The old school chair was cool too, and the service to make sure you're comfortable was top notch. This place is really different. +1 to the management and team there!",positive
"Amazing! That word sums it all up nicely. This was my first trip to any sort of male-oriented salon. Their description, ""Grooming studio for men"" is a nice tight way of saying ""Come hang out in our man cave and get your hair cut"". I didn't know what to expect walking into this place, but I was thoroughly blown away. The waiting area looks like the ultimate man's living room. The receptionist offered to take my jacket and make myself at home. There's a leather sofa, a coffee table with some manly magazines on it, a giant flat-screen TV playing sports with also a PS3 hoked up, and a bar. Yes a bar. That bar is used for them to offer you a drink from which is included in the ""Alpha Male"" service package. When it's your turn, the stylist takes you over to a chair and you have a quick consultation about what you'd like done. After that you're over to a station where you wash your hands and they do a paraffin wax hand dip. Next, the stylist will get you seated at the sink. You get a quick facial rub down and you're face is wrapped in a hot towel. While your face and hands are basking in the warmth you get your hair washed and scalp massaged. Once this is all complete it's on to the cut. The cut was the most attention my hair has ever gotten in my entire life. My hair is pretty short, so it mostly involves clippers to get it cut. I'm not sure how many different guards she used but she sure made sure everything was blended perfectly. Best haircut I've ever had. The Alpha Male service is $45 before tax and tip which is extremely reasonable in my opinion for everything you get. I highly recommend this place to any guy or ladies, this would make a great gift for a man in your life. Nov 30-day challenge 15/30",positive
"Easily my best experience with a salon to date. I have long curly hair, and quite commonly I find that stylists don't cut it accordingly. At Mankind, I enjoyed a fantastic cut tailored specifically to my hair type from Anisa, a stylist who specializes in curly hair. It's definitely my favourite cut I've ever had. On top of this, the experience was excellent. The additional services that come with the cut make it an actual experience, and the friendly and very intelligent staff made me feel comfortable even though it was my first time at their establishment. I highly recommend this to anyone looking for a change, and a great hair experience!",positive
"Here was a place I really enjoyed visiting for a number of reasons. For the most part, it's because of my hair stylist started working at this new ""Studio Grooming for Men"" I have been with her for over 7 years and, although there are only 2 other places she has worked, I felt the most at ease showing up at this place for the first time. They have an old meets new feel to the place without making you feel at home. What I got out of this place is a new idea that really works for people like me. By this I mean that I like the whole grooming part of getting a haircut which I'm not afraid to admit as long as it's from a place like Mankind. Now, I'm not quite sure if I'll use all their services, yet they offer a few extras that I enjoy such as a hand/wax treatment while you get your cut and a hot towel that is incredibly relaxing. Another nice touch is the drink they offer you on the way in. They have a 65"" screen TV which is hooked up to a Playstation which makes this place so chill. They also offer things like men's manicures ""The Man Hands"", massage table ""Feeling Kneady"" in a quiet room area but the coolest thing that I haven't seen since my grandfather used to take me to his barber is their straight blade shave. this place doesn't smell like chemical products nor is there a thousand people running around chaotically. One feature that I thought was great was the TV's at every grooming station so that you don't miss the game or whatever... There prices were all on their website so there were no surprises and I thought they were great value. A place to check out, for sure.",positive
"This is the worst place to get you hair coloured . So my mother in law goes to this place and it's quite close to where we live and one day I was nearby and I consulted with May I showed her a picture of balayage that I wanted to get done and she say say no problem you come I'll do it for you it will take 3-4 hours so I decided to get book an appointment and came by. I showed her picture the day off and asked her of possible outcomes that could happen so she chose a picture and said we'll do this. She coerced me into doing an oil treatment to so this whole duration I hadn't seen my hair even once after the bleaching toning and treatment . And I am a hair stylist too I noticed she didn't do the balayage technique on me instead did the slicing method so I though maybe it something I don't know about. The next thing you know she starts to dry my hair and it looks nothing like balayage, my highlight are coming straight from my root and they aren't blond the are orange and it looks nothing like the picture I showed her. She turned my hair green instead of ash blonde as you may notice. I am so disappointed and scarred and it's week away from my wedding I don't know what to do? I went to ask for a refund and she refused this is so unprofessional. She wanted me colour her hair again to to just refund me half my money can you imagine? You think I would trust her after she did something like that? So I told her to keep my money as charity and this was the most unprofessional job ever! Please don't ever trust an asian woman to do your hair ! I can't never trust another hair stylist ever aga",negative
"My stylist was in a hurry so she gave me an uneven cut. Although I did show her the picture and told her to not cut my hair short, she did the exact opposite. Also on top of getting a weird uneven haircut, I realized that she never used a shaver, just the trimmer to clean the hair on my neck and around my ears I guess I was supposed to guide them through all this. Will go to a different place next time.",negative
After having read great reviews for them on yelp. I decided to get my hair cut here ! They were really patient and took care of each and every details of the cut and did a great job. Thanks to their accuracy .,positive
"I went to May Hui's Hair Design yesterday evening calling in around 630 when they close at 7pm. May was so gracious and said she would take care of me. And did she ever!! May was ""aMAYzing. She patiently cut my hair and showed me ways of styling my hair after my haircut. She gave me ideas on colouring and what would best work for my hair. What a pleasant experience. When it comes to customer care, May was ""bangs"" on!",positive
"I've been going to this salon for the last 10 years. May is the only person I trust with my hair. Her cut and coloring technique is fantastic. She listens to what you want, and even makes suggestions as to what would work for you. Even though I've moved away from Mississauga, I visit this salon every time I'm in town. Joanna does haircuts for my brother and dad, who have also been at this same salon for years. Many times I've gone to May (after ruining my hair at other salons) and asked her to fix my hair. Without telling her what I want, she immediately knows what needs to be done, and does it in average and cheaper prices. They're really a great salon with excellent skill for the price. I highly recommend this salon to anyone in the Mississauga area. You will not be disappointed!",positive
"Woodbine mall Melonhead, i had the worst experience, besides them not knowing how to work with children, they were rough, and didnt get the job done properly.",negative
I called on a Saturday at 4pm for my one year old's first haircut - they accommodated us for 5:30pm and we were even a few minutes later than that. The place was empty of customers because we were the last clients but the staff remained and were very courteous. Our son needed a boyish haircut since he got curls and people kept thinking he's a girl. Our stylists name is Natalia and she did a fantastic job on him. He remained calm through the whole haircut but got upset with the trimmer because of the noise - still overall it went smoothly. They provided a first hair cut certificate with a picture The place is clean and have many fun seats to choose from and toys / tv shoes to distract. We were done in 20 mins. Based on previous reviews I think we happened to get lucky with this visit and stylist. They made sure we were happy with the visit and pictures taken and did not make us feel rushed.,positive
"I rate Melonhead ( Woodbine Centre) -0 score...Sept. 16, 2017...time: 12:30-1:30, it was the most horrible and disgusting exeperience we ever had with my 4 yr old daughter...we expected to be treated equal with other customers but they just let us wait definitely waste our time and effort and even our patience for ""NOTHING"" beware of these old lady wearing eyeglasses and the chubby one because they might give you hope and ended up nothing and going home disappointed and angry and the worst part they make my daughter go home UNHAPPY because they don't give her time to do what they were suppose to be doing in the first place...instead the lady who took our appointment just walk away for lunch and while one employee is still working with another customer the chubby one just stay at the register area and say nothing until I say we can't wait any longer coz we still have somewhere to go to and I expect that she should've said oh ""I'm sorry""about that but or try to say something but its not she never say a word until were no longer on her watch....My gosh!! Can you imagine they were very unprofessional...never ever recommed this location...ever!!!",negative
Don't bring your kids here. My daughter has wavy hair and we have given these guys 3 shots at doing a good job. No dice. Each time her hair is cut unevenly. I could do this at home so to pay almost $40 for a bad kids haircut - not worth it. I called and left a message telling them we were not happy and wanted to come get it fixed - they did not call back.,negative
It was a busy day and the staff are fighting and arguing in front of the customers. When I asked for a scissors only cut our stylist suggested that it would take too long. Appointments weren't booked correctly. Pretty much the worst experience we have had with mediocre haircuts as a end result. Consider somewhere else.,negative
"We came here a few weeks ago. They have pretty reasonable hours, but they close promptly at their posted closing time. I looked up this location on their website before I went, so I knew they didn't take any clients 20 minutes before closing. I took a chance and went anyway, they were accommodating, and cut my son's hair (we showed up just at that 20 minutes mark). I did witness an altercation with another potential client who called to say they were coming, but didn't actually show up until 7 minutes to closing, they were not able to accommodate him, and he didn't like that. So the cut is pretty true to their website, you need to be there with your child 20 minutes before otherwise you are better to come another day. Overall it was good.",negative
"Ugh it's taken me too long but here it is. Took my son for his first haircut and it was nothing short of AWFUL. He has curly hair which I mentioned when I booked the appointment and he came out with a bowl cut. I asked them to fix it and he ended up with a short bowl cut. To add insult to injury, it cost me as much as it would if I'd taken him to my high end salon. Never again.",negative
"Melonheads is 5-stars in several departments: friendly service, decor (brightly decorated salon with character chairs including Thomas), free photo and certificate for the first haircut, free hair accessory and glitter hairspray and most importantly to my little one - free lollipop at the end. However, the quality of the haircut is where it falls to 1-star. I know, they're toddlers and don't need perfectly coifed styles. I'm not one of *those* moms who will cry ""They ruined her hair, just ruined it!"". But I think the hair cut should still be quality - one that is not uneven and looks like I took a bowl to her head and trimmed around it. I had to do some of my own maintenance and trimming of longer pieces when we got home.",negative
"This was an absolute disaster. I hesitate to give this review, but the person who cut my son's hair on a Sunday should not be a hairdresser. It was chopped roughly and unevenly all over. It was impossible to see when it was wet but once dry it was unbelievable. I do not want to embarrass him by bringing him back to ask what happened. Please avoid.",negative
Super understanding and helpful with our seriously anti-haircut two year old! They did a great job even though he screamed and we had to wrestle him down :) Well worth the money.,positive
"I always take my son for his haircuts here. A couple of years ago, I was pretty nervous how his first-ever-haircut would go as he's a bit wild and was also a bit clingy to me when he was only 1 years old. It was EXCELLENT. The ladies at Melonhead are professionals with kids and there's lots of stuff to distract kids (i.e. great airplane/car seats, movies on tv, nice bright colours everywhere). Since then, we've always returned. My son actually asks if we can go for haircuts now! Highly recommended!",positive
"I took my son here yesterday for his first ever haircut. The space is nice and bright, lots of things around to keep the kids entertained and distracted. Unfortunately the haircut and customer service were both awful. Our ""stylist"", Veronika, took about two seconds to examine my son's long, curly hair before she started cutting. I had wanted it cleaned up but kept on the long side, what we ended up with is an awful, Dorothy Hamill type bowl cut. I told her she was taking too much length off and she didn't even pause or look up. Nor did she spend any time when she was finished to check her work to see how it looked. I was clearly unhappy with the cut, yet none of the five people behind the counter would make eye contact with us, let alone ask if we were satisfied. It was clear they didn't want to deal with the problem and wanted us out as quickly as possible. This was a disappointing experience in every way, and I am so sad when I look at my sweet son's ridiculous haircut! I wouldn't even think of going back there for a fix, that's how low the skill level was. Visit at your own risk.",negative
"This place is great for kids. We brought our son for his first haircut and it was awesome. I heard of horror stories about your child's first haircut but with the car, air plane, pony seats to entertain them he didn't say boo. The stylist cut his hair fast, she was very patient with him since he kept moving to look up at her. The haircut turned out great. We were very pleased. The staff are very nice and love children. We recommend this place if you have children, it's the place to go!",positive
"I have gotten my hair cut twice here and I am very pleased with the results! Both times I have gotten a haircut from Veronica who is very sweet and friendly and she does a fantastic job with what I want and she also gives input about what would be good whether it has to do with the type of cut, the length of the cut or what product to use afterwards. I would definitely recommend this to anyone.",positive
"This was my first time coming here as I just moved to chandler from out of state. Had a great experience. Staff is very friendly and nice to all the customers. Aimee cut my hair, she knew what she was doing and followed my instructions of what I wanted perfectly. The blade shave on the back of the neck and hot towel to follow is a great touch as well If you are looking for a new place for a hair cut this is the place to go!",positive
"I highly recommend you go see Aimee Solano here on McQeen in Gilbert...not only is she an expert hairstylist, she will make you feel like a million bucks after your neck massage, multiple hot towel treatments, and the best close shave you will ever get. Thank you Aimee for being so great at what you do!...David Sambell",positive
I've gotten my hair cut here twice so far. The customer service is phenomenal. Very clean and tidy establishment. Rachel has cut my hair on both occasions and is very professional and amicable. I'm extremely picky with my haircuts so MUGs will definitely be my permanent barbershop as long as she's there!,positive
"I have to admit I had a fantastic experience today and will recommend Men's Ultimate. Many things impressed me but what stood out is Becky's willingness to talk up everyone who works here. Made me feel very comfortable that should I need a haircut and she wasn't there, every one there does a great job. However, with that said, I will always try to book my appointment as she made the experience great. Friendly, professional, and easy to talk to. Plus, she does a great haircut. Five stars for sure.",positive
"Today,12/7/2017 I scheduled an appointment online for 10:15. This would of been the third time I would have had my hair cut at this location. I arrived at 10:00 knowing that I would have to wait from my previous two appointments. There were two customers in chairs with smocks on and only one girl cutting hair when I arrived. She did immediately greet me and said it wouldn't be long. The another girl arrived, came up front and then was to never be seen again. Now its 10:30 and between the girl cutting hair, answering the phone and texting on her personal phone that was constantly going off I knew my turn was nowhere near my appointment time. At 10:40, she finished one customer and asked me to come back another time as she tried to hand me a coupon. I refused the coupon because I will never come back again. Obviously M.U.G. has no respect for my time and has done nothing to improve their service to earn my business from the last time I was there. I am very disappointed because this location is less than a mile from my house and do believe they provide a better haircut than their close competitor Great Clips which is where I ended up going and was immediately greeted with a full staff of stylists and the same haircut. Sorry but I do believe that after three chances I have done my part to give you the opportunity to earn my business.",negative
Top notch service! I've been getting my hair cut here every two-three weeks for several months and have never had a bad cut. Becky is my go to and she always takes great care of me. Walk in appointments are accepted but I've always made appointments since it's a twenty five minute drive. Staff has been helpful with product information and they have a good selection of hair care and styling products.,positive
"Nicer place for guys to get their grooming. Cecilia did a great job with my hair, was friendly and a good conversationalist. I will be coming here again.",positive
"Finally one in Gilbert on Val Vista/Williams Field!! This barber shop is great! Kathrynn has been cutting my hair for last 3 months and never looked better. There is also a new Brew Pub going in next door so looks like I will be getting a haircut every 2 weeks now! FINALLY a place where you can set an appointment! I had to quit Sports Clips due to long wait regardless of when you would show up. My time is valuable and I do not like 1.5 hours to get a haircut! Anyway super stylish place, great chairs and personable stylists..what is not to like??",positive
"This was the first time ever coming to MUG. The Stylist Becky took great care of me and I had No complaints, No long wait times, and they really know how to cut hair. Prices are on point with competition and a much better Atmosphere, Stylists, and Quality. Will be back, Thanks",positive
"So,it's been a bit since my last review. I've had a constant person cutting my hair Dani. It's been great no complaints for two years. Unfortunately she's no longer a constant as she has moved on to bigger and better things. I made an appointment for a haircut 9:30 and I showed up 2 minutes early. There was a walk in that came in just ahead of me and he was taken back for a hair cut I wasn't even acknowledged!!! I walked out, and will never return I headed to another shop, and I will see how it goes at least they said hi when I walked in great start! I'm giving two stars only because the person called, however 45 minutes later I guess better late than never!! Perhaps good customer service is a dying thing, but it's the most important thing when you're in the people business it's how business grows novel concept I know?!!",negative
"Decided to try this place since it is pretty close to home. I got there to find it didn't open till 9. No problem. It's only 15 minutes and there is a Dutch bros next door. 9am rolls around so I go to get my cut and the door is still locked. I see at least 1 employee inside, so I figure she is setting up and will open the door in a minute or so. Well 10 minutes go by and it's still locked up. I decided to leave when I noticed other customers showing up only to be locked out. Bad first impression MUG.",negative
"I've been going here for more than a year. The service is great and the cut is always what I want. TV's, sports, guy movies...etc...",positive
I was referred here from a few of my co workers who had been going here and had nothing but awesome feedback. I always dreaded the inconsistent haircuts I'd get from other places so I decided to give this place a try. I've been coming here since August and Elisha has done an awesome job every time cutting my hair!,positive
"Sierra was great. Good haircut and great scalp, neck, and shoulder massage. I gave it 4 stars because the website makes this place seem much different. Online it seems like it would be a men's lounge kind of feel. it's close with the big chairs and nice fixtures, but the fluorescent lights and general appearance of disorganization somewhat kills it. They have cool looking hanging lights. Would be nicer if they used them, killed the fluorescence, and organized a bit. Would be even nicer if the back office wasn't disorganized and generally open for everyone to see",positive
I was in a rush and needed to get a haircut before going out of town. I wasnt able to get an appointment at the usual salons that I've frequented for the last few years so i decided to give MUG a shot. Since my first appointment I've yet to return to the fancy salons and stylists cause the girls at MUG have their s**t on lock! Best haircut I've recieved in years and at a fraction of the cost. My biggest gripe about stylists is I never know whats gonna look best so i bring in pics of things i like and ask for advice. Most stylists had nothing for me. The girls at MUG were able to help out a lot and with my new style my girlfriend says I look like such a rugged bad ass. Needless to say ive been returning ever since. Definitely recommend.,positive
"Second time going there and each time I went there I was disappointed. This SHOP just opened up near my home and I was happy to see something similar to V's Barbershop open up near me since I use to drive about 20 minutes to get to one. Few months later, I decided to stroll in for a haircut, lady took me in - it wasn't busy at all - in fact it was empty, I told her I wanted a haircut and she went along cutting my hair which felt like something I can get at Fantastics Sams or SuperCuts. I didn't feel at it was a special ""MENS"" Grooming place at all. After my haircut, I looked at it a few times and had to correct her on uneven sides and bulk hair leftover. I mean c'mon - you want us to pay big bucks and I have to correct your hair skills? The second visit, I figured I'd give them another shot but I'm usually that guy that ""you only get one shot to prove me you're good"" but since I'm a nice guy - I thought maybe I'd just get a shave/trim. One lady in there, nobody else in there and I have to make an appointment? I mean how long does it take to get a shave/trim ?? No where in their website says anything about making appointment so what gives? You really can't spare another 20-30 minutes to do a quick shave/trim? People make appointments all the time and they still wait to get seen so even if you were 10 minutes late for your appointment it wouldn't matter you just made the company money and probably an extra tip for taking me in as a walk - in? Does this place hire dummies or what? I'm not going back here again. V's Barbershop doesn't disappoint me, never has, and they are worth far more better tips then this wannabe place.",negative
"Pretty good haircut. More of a salon vs barber shop. They only shave the back of your neck and not trim anything past there. V's gives you the whole hot towel wrap, straight razor your neck, beard and behind your ears.",negative
"I went MUG about a year ago, and had no idea it was a full service trim. I really enjoyed the staff and the cut was great. We moved away due to work but now were back! They are quite busy so the best thing to do is man an appointment. The lady that cut my hair was Jaysmn and she did a fantastic job. I would highly recommend MUG.",positive
I have been going for several months now and it's a great place for a men's cut and shave. The staff is very polite and great at what they do. My son now goes there too and teenagers are hard to please when it comes to haircuts. The best is to make an appointment as they are busy on most days for walk ins but that is a sign of a good men's barber shop.,positive
"Elisha at MUG has styled my hair for the last year. I really appreciate the ease of scheduling (always scheduling at the last minute), the relaxed atmosphere, spotless stations and low pressure attitude. I don't go to MUG to make decisions about this or that, Elisha and her team just KNOW what I want. What I want is easy, no pressure, clean, relaxed and quiet...oh yeah, and a great style and fabulous Shiatzu! The Dutch Bros next door is just an added bonus. Keep it up gang!",positive
"I went in there on a Monday morning at 9:30 without an appointment and thought they were closed. There was just one girl working there who made me wait 5 minutes because she had to get her station ready. This was my first time going there and it was excited because the girl (Heather) had a tattoo of scissors and a comb other forearm. I figured anyone who marks there body for life with scissors and a comb must know hair cutting is their calling in life and I'm in for a great haircut. Aside from asking how my day was and what I wanted done to my hair, she didn't say a word to me. No one else was in the shop and it was very awkward. I've never had my haircut by anyone who was so silent. I think I shocked her that I didn't want a buzz cut because she seemed like she didn't know what she was doing with the scissors. She acted like it was her first time cutting hair. Then when she shaved the back of my neck with the straight edge razor, she shaved little spots at a time instead of shaving one long section at a time like a barber does. I was waiting for a camera crew to come out and say this was a joke and I was on tv that's how bizarre this was. When I got home I saw that she left pieces of hair covering my ears and missed spots on the sides. Who tattoos scissors and comb on their arm if they don't know how to use them?! I felt duped and won't go back to this shop again.",negative
"This place is great, have been going for almost two years. Have seen a fair amount of turnover in women working there, but they are always excellent and always professional. I always recommend them to anyone asking about men's grooming.",positive
Mug was a great place to work but it is time for me to move on. I am now at Fantastic Sam's off the Gilbert exit on the 202. I'll miss my regular clients...good bye n God bless.,positive
"I tried this salon recently, mainly because I drive past it and it didn't look too busy. I made an appointment for the following weekend morning and was able to sit down after she finished up with one guy. Good thing I made an appointment because six other guys walked in during my time there. It was $20 for a haircut, but that included a shampoo. They offer a full line of services and seem to have a strong focus on shaving and shaving products. I did not partake in that, but maybe next time. The haircut was quick (I dont have much hair), but looked great. I will definitely use this one again.",positive
"Awesome, no-gimmick hair salon/barber for men. Menu options include scissor cut, shave cut, beard/face shave, shampoo, etc. Had my first visit yesterday and I'm impressed. Got a haircut and shampoo & was in and out in 20 minutes. Wife actually complimented my new Doo' so I guess I have a new place and stylist. Her name is Renee by the way and she kicks ass at cutting hair.",positive
"Being new to AZ, I needed to find a new stylist. I received a ""welcome to the neighborhood"" coupon for a free haircut and style with a purchase of any skin treatment. I booked a Dermaplane facial with Noelle and a haircut/style. I didn't know which stylist I was getting, but hoped to have one of their master stylist cut my hair due to it being very fine. My facial with Noelle was amazing and the results were great. My face was so smooth and my foundation went on so much better! I'll definitely keep that up as she recommended. Next was my haircut and I was happy to have Lisa as my stylist. I told her I was possibly looking to go shorter but wasn't committed yet. She recommended a bob for now and if I decide to go shorter, it's something I can always do later. Lisa did a great job and even recommended an idea for color which I'm doing at my next appointment. Front desk staff were also great, attentive and helpful!",positive
"First time, last time customer here. I paid 190 to the salon and 20 in tip to my stylist. Not even sure what I ended up with actually. I was roped into at least 60 bucks worth of ""conditioning or gloss or whatever"". I wont drag my stylist but what gets me if her mission was to make my current set up ""easier to maintain"" why did it cost so much? I have never in my life paid over 200 for a cramped setting like that. And the stylist knew their prices are ridiculous because she even said, ""you can just get a touch-up next time"". Like who wants to get a fraction of their hair done? Overall, the prices are insane for the setting. I will head back to Scottsdale. I am getting my entire head highlighted/low lighted cut and styled for that price. I cant stand the partial work, its ghetto. And I refuse to line the pockets of salon owners that wanna cramp people in all awkward like.",negative
I had a bad haircut that needed some help. I read the reviews of JJ and decided to give her a try. She looked the situation over and started cutting. I love it! She is very skilled and listened to what I had in mind. I'll definitely be back when it's time for my next cut.,positive
"I was referred by a friend to Karinna at Michael Alexander Salon. I have long black hair that was previously bleached twice to try and get a purple color (to no avail-it ended up red or pink). Karinna was attentive to my needs and seemed to really care about the condition that my hair ended up in. She was excited to see the end result especially when my hair took the lightening way better than she hoped. My hair ended up a beautiful, bright violet (which she mixed with a bit of pink to even out the blue tones in it-so smart!) ombre and I love it! One issue I had was that Karinna offered to trim the dead ends off of my hair, to which I agreed to a 2 inch trim. I didn't realize that she was not going to preserve the layering in my hair and basically chopped off 2 inches and made my hair end very bluntly all at the same length. I didn't realize this until later when the curls she gave me started to loosen. When I called her about it she was gracious and offered to add in those layers for me at no extra charge (+tip of course!). She squeezed me in on a busy Saturday and even though she had to reschedule me at the last minute I still appreciated her working me in as a free appointment. She fixed the layers to a satisfactory level and made me a happy customer! My advice-Karinna is amazing at coloring so definitely go to her for that! In terms of cut, just make sure you are communicative about your wants and needs. Otherwise it may not turn out the way you want (not that it was Karinna's fault or anything-I never said anything about the layers so that's on me. I just asssumed she would keep them). But if you aren't happy with your hair she'll definitely make it right. As a reference, I paid $170 + tip for my bleaching and coloring. Thanks Karinna!",positive
"Best haircuts I have ever had. In my 40 years of getting haircuts, the ones I get here are the best. Normally a haircut is a haircut, but not here. You get a better cut. I use JJ, but I think they are all top shelf.",positive
JJ does my haircuts and Brazilian Treatments and she is the absolute best! I have been going to her for 9 years and I always get compliments on my hair cut. The salon is upbeat and friendly. I highly recommend Michael Alexander Salon.,positive
"CFF Clean Fast Friendly.This was my first visit to Micheal Alexander,wooooow Korrina T she did my hair i love it,thanks Korrina T for the best customer service,I am so happy that I decided to do my hair here,i will recommended to everyone.Absolutely 5 stars.",positive
"I went in on an ""Our Town"" coupon and got to sit in Julie (JJ's) chair. She did a great job with what I was looking for. The cut and style came out the way that I was expecting and she didn't bs me in telling me that she could give me the look I wanted when I knew I had some issues with my ends in the first place. I will definitely be coming back.",positive
"Wonderful place and amazing service. Beth did an excellent job on my eyelashes with the extension. She is also kind and friendly and listens to you. Everybody who works at the salon is professional and helpful. I'm so glad to find them, and I can't wait to go back to do the filling on my eyelashes. Thank you everybody for the kindness and care. Thank you Beth for making my eyes beautiful.",positive
It took me 6 years of bad highlights and underwhelming haircuts to find Beth at Michelle Alexander. She's a skilled artist with a ton of technical color experience including my favorite- balayage. I love that she has fresh ideas and is always ahead of the trends.,positive
One of the best salons I have ever been too. Awesome services. Very flexible schedules and hours. Very upscale for awesome prices. By far one of my favorite salons.,positive
Amazing amazing service!!! If your looking for a clean friendly experienced salon go here! The nail tech does an amazing job! I have gotten my eye lash extensions done here by Dana and they are amazing! Never been so pleased! Beth has been doing my hair and I love my ombré she does!!! Love love the services here they make me feel like family! Book your appt today!! :-),positive
"I decided to give this salon a go, but in the end I just wish I had gone another way. The Salon is small, but clean and the receptionist was very friendly. She correctly guessed who I was based on the time I walked in and the appointment that was scheduled which was nice, she let me know that she would inform my stylist that I was there. I sat myself down and not another word was said to me or another glance given for the next 20 minutes. I wasn't too upset about the wait time because I did arrive 15 minutes early. However, no offer of a magazine to read, water to drink, or coffee, etc. Eye contact seemed to be avoided at all costs. To be fair, there was some self serve coffee set out if I had wanted any, but I didn't. It was cool to me because I'm not much for eating and drinking while I get my hair done to begin with, but if you're going to try to be competitive with other high end salons in the valley (of which there are many), you're going to have to do far better than some 'serve yourself' gas station style coffee setup on the side. After 20 minutes of waiting my stylist came out and so it began. I felt that I was very clear in the style of cut that I wanted, even going so far as to show pictures of what I wanted, and then we discussed color. Then.. the cutting started.... Now, I went in for a pretty classic cut, something in the style of an A-Line, where I could tuck it to the side if I wanted. This should be a simple haircut for even the novice stylist. I don't know why I bothered to say anything in the first place - it was a cut that I could have gotten at Great Clips, if even that good. While all of this was going on, the entire staff seemed disinterested in being there at best. Most of them were doing 1 of 3 things, 1) Checking their cellphones and texting constantly, 2) Bitching about the atmosphere and the music there - I guess station changes are not allowed? or 3) Cleaning / sweeping or doing menial chores with scowls on their faces. Biting my tongue since it was already far too late in the process, I hoped that the whole bad cut would be redeemed in the color / styling portion of the experience. What I got for the color was even more shockingly bad than the damned cut itself! As many of you know, hair dye tends to DYE the skin it touches. By the time the stylist was finished slopping the dye on (and I don't use that term lightly), I had dye all over my forehead, ears, neck and face. Even worse, she didn't offer to wipe it off of my face at ALL!!! I shit you not - she dabbed around my ears, scrubbed around the hairline, and didn't even touch the dye that she smeared across my face that was visibly darkening!! Even then she still didn't wipe it off but tried to brush the side of the hair over it to cover it! To add insult to injury, the entire botched job ended up costing me FAR more for JUST the cut and color / highlights than what I have paid at previous high end salons. No product after that - why bother? I have gone to Dolce Salon, Mane Attraction Salon and various other Salons across the Valley over the years. Any ONE of them had far superior service, far superior staff, far superior environment, and far superior quality - PLUS I could get product to go with the new cut and style for less than what I paid to walk out of here for. Long story short? I walked out looking Shemp from the 3 Stooges with a black eye thanks to the dye smeared across my face. I did manage to scrub the dye off at home. My boyfriend ended up trimming the back in places she had 'missed'. Yeah.. awesome. And while the stylist was nice and friendly, I will not be going back there. Buyer beware.",negative
"I have been going to JJ at this salon for about a year since being on a search for a full service stylist (that I'm happy with) in the Phoenix area. JJ does a great cut, color and highlights and I receive multiple compliments from strangers regarding my color. The salon is run very efficiently-the receptionist always addresses me by name upon arrival, lets my stylist know I've arrived and immediately offers me a drink. I observe the work of other stylists when I'm there and find that every person who leaves the chair looks polished and happy with their hair. They also offer nail and skin care services although I haven't had personal experience with those, therefore can't comment on them. I'd compare it to any high end salon in the Phoenix/Scottsdale area. If you are looking for an excellent full service salon and you are within a 30 minute drive, this salon is worth checking out. They are right off I-17 and easy to get to. You won't be sorry.",positive
"I love the nail techs at Michael Alexander salon. I've been going to Kellie for years now and she is amazing! Nicole also does fabulous nails so you can't lose! Trust me, I'm very particular about my acrylic nails. The hair stylists all know me by name and are very friendly. It's a welcoming environment and everyone is friendly and helpful. I highly recommend this salon.",positive
"Their staff is extremely professional, fun and talented! I have used them for numerous occasions on top of my normal routine and they always come through and make me feel beautiful! I love the lash extensions that Tina does, Kellie does amazing nails and Cindy Maxwell does my hair color and brazillian blowout. Love them all!",positive
"I've been searching for a stylist since my usual stylist left almost a year ago from Anthem. I called in and got scheduled in with Lisa the same day. Lisa is great - not only did she fix some nasty ""oops"" cutting issues with my trying to find a person to do my hair, but she also redid my highlights so they look amazing. She does an awesome job and my highlights don't fade out to the straw-color they were notorious for fading too. I have found my stylist!",positive
"Today was my second experience with this salon and it was probably the worst customer service I have experienced in a salon, ever. I am not even going to go into all of it, but the worst of it was that the receptionist had to shampoo me and blow-dry my hair while the stylist fit in her friend. The stylist never even came to check how the color turned out. I left with damp, unstyled hair, needing toner and a cut (which I was scheduled for). I am just so surprised. I better find a new salon to fix this fast! Hello, this is AZ, there are tons of awesome salons! Do yourself a favor and skip this place - they won't care anyways.",negative
"Love Love Love this salon. Immediately when you walk into the door, you feel like you have known these people for a long time. They seem like all close friends. Good environment to relax and get your hair, makeup or nails done! (And don't forget the skin care they do here too). I will never go to another salon to get my hair cut/colored. They all do a fantastic job! I always walk out of there feeling like a million bucks but I'm not paying a fortune! Also, just recently, I had my entire wedding party get their makeup and hair done for my wedding there. We all got in to each stylist around the same time, so it was really quick. And my gosh, everyone looked amazing! And the makeup looks stunning. Not to mention the false eyelashes we all got. Very classy (super surprised too b/c it was my first time with fake eyelashes on). I live in Phoenix but will make the trip up to Anthem just for the service and quality!",positive
"Best blow dry ever! Michael knows colour, cut, extensions, styling and most importantly does the best blow dry in Scottsdale. I can never make my hair look even close. He will be honest and if you want to do something different with your hair, he will tell you if your type of hair will do that. With over 30 years experience he is not a young kid fresh out of beauty school that hopes for the best. He knows his stuff and obviously is the owner of the salon. Yes, the location is a prime spot in Old Town (right next to Teres) but is just a little cheaper in pricing than other salons. His salon is definitely a nicer business but he keeps it casual where it is not a snobby atmosphere. He does have a big clientele. If you need your hair done within the week he can typically fit you in. Call the business line. He usually is the person who answers and set an appointment. Guarantee if your loyalty is up for grabs then you should go to Michael V Salon and see what you think.",positive
"Kimberly is amazing! I am very picky wth my hair and normally wait till I go home to SD to get my hair done! But I was desperate for a trim and my hair needed some help bad! I have long balayaged/ombré hair. After doing some research, I decided to try Kimberly! She exceeded my expectations! I went in for a deep conditioning and haircut and it turned out so great! She listened to exactly what I wanted and cut my layers so well that it looked like I recolored my hair! The deep conditioning treatment was amazing...it made my hair feel and look like silk. The next day at work, I received sooo many compliments on how great my hair looked! So much so that my coworker ended up booking with Kimberly that same day for the following week! Finding the right hairstylist is tough, but I'm so thankful to have found Kimberly! Thanks so much, Kimberly! I will definitely be back!",positive
"I arrived in Scottsdale a couple of weeks ago for a business project. I'm from Los Angeles and I am VERY picky when it comes to my hair style (cut and color). I happened to notice a woman in line at a local store and asked her where she got her AMAZING hair cut? She said Michael V Salon and be sure to ask for Michael. Two days later I am sitting in Michael's chair at his salon. He provided a thorough consultation (reviewing my hair texture, current style, color, cut etc). Michael wanted to know what was working and wasn't including the products I used. By the way, he did NOT attempt to sell me any new products -- he thought what I was using was great (L'Oreal Kerastase line). I was beyond happy with the outcome. Truly my hair has NEVER looked so FANTASTIC! The haircut was done with full concentration and precision as was my hair color. He works with one client at a time and doesn't walk away until he has completed the service and you are happy. I HIGHLY recommend Michael and the Michael V Salon!!! Elizabeth S. Los Angeles, CA",positive
"KIMBERLY IS AMAZING!!! Not only is she well priced, she does an amazing job and gives suggestions on super affordable hair products! 10/10. Highly recommend Kimberly!",positive
"I miss getting my hair cut and highlighted by Michael! :( I had to move to the po-dunk backwards city of San Antonio two years ago and haven't been able to find anyone as good. More expensive-yes, but no where near the expertise, class and honesty of Michael. I'm writing this review because I just had a rotten experience here in San Antonio and decided if I was going to give them a review, I should give Michael one too! I hope to travel back to Scottsdale in January next year and am absolutely planning to make an appointment!",positive
"Kim is the worst. Super dishonest, doesn't do work well. Great salon, nice looking. But worst hair experience i have ever had.",negative
I've been going to Michael V.'s for over 17 years. Michael could probably give you the best cut & color with his eyes close. Worth every penny.,positive
"First visit to this salon was awesome!! My family and I have been going to Elizabeth for over three years now and every time has been a great experience. My son and wife see Elizabeth more often than I do...as you can tell from my pics...I have no hair! My wife is extremely picky and trendy and Elizabeth has been dedicated to keeping her (hair) happy. Elizabeth's prices for Color, Cuts and Brazilian Blowouts are more than reasonable and every month she sends us texts with promotions!! Elizabeth has been our family stylist for years but she has also become part of our family. If you're looking for a new stylist...someone who cares about how you look and not just how much money you put in her purse...check her out!!! Contact Elizabeth directly @ 623-234-0471 (yes, I asked her permission before blasting her # over Yelp!)",positive
"Elizabeth is an outstanding stylist! I came to her with orange hair, because my last dye job was horrendous and I attempted to fix it myself. I walked into the salon and she was the only stylist there and with a client. I was in tears. I only waited a moment before Elizabeth acknowledged me. She was kind, knowledgeable, professional and available to help me the following day. Its rare to find a hair stylist in Old Town Scottsdale that care as much as the stylists do in this salon. Color correction, cuts, Brazilian Blowouts, you name it, this lady does it! And it didn't cost me my first born either! Scottsdale precision and perfection without the Scottsdale cost. This salon has a cool unpretentious vibe as well...Its worth checking out!!",positive
"I went for the first time last month for a cut and highlights. Michael was very good at understanding what I wanted and most importantly, GAVE ME WHAT I WANTED! I paid just a little less than what I had been paying so I think I'll go back since I'm on a tighter budget these days like most of us ;) Hopefully he can keep his prices reasonable. I really don't get these stylists that charge like they're using real gold in your hair instead of $4 bleach products.",positive
"I have been going to Michael for at least a year now, and am a pretty satisfied customer. 1) great location at the corner of Indian School and Scottsdale Rd. 2) totally chill vibe for the primo location! Michael owns the salon and keeps the feel very grounded -- not pretentious or snooty at ALL. 3) great value: very reasonable prices for cut and color 4) flexible scheduling. The one heads up I must give is that Michael will DEFINITELY want to talk with you while you're there, so don't plan on any spaced out zen time. If you're reading a magazine, he'll be right over your shoulder asking what you are reading about. On the plus side, he is super intelligent and outspoken so it's fun to talk about politics or local issues with him -- he's very well rounded and has had a super interesting life.",positive
"A co-worker came in with a dope haircut, prompting me to ask where she got it. Cut to me having a minute off, and time to make the appointment. The owner and head stylist, Kelley, had the last appointment free in 90 minutes, so come on by. Excellent. It's a little shop tucked across from the Giant Eagle (don't park in their lot!), with a comfy waiting area. Kelley called me over for the consult and just got it immediately. Not only that but she was enthusiastically on board with what I wanted. I had had a bad cut from a different salon previously and told her all the ways I didn't want to hold onto that shape, as well as what I did want. An hour later my hair was all over the floor in a ring of the fallen, and my hair looked AMAZING. All the texture and layers and movement I missed was there again. Seriously a great haircut. And she even passed on her car mechanic's info (contextually - I needed on and she was talking about it). Really aces.",positive
???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????,positive
"I've had probably a dozen cuts at Mint by Kelsey. My hair is fine and straight and a good cut makes all the difference. Kelsey has given me a truly great cut every time. When I was ready to change styles, she helped me decide what would work for me, taking into consideration my hair type, time I was willing to spend on it (not much), what would be most flattering--and she hit it out of the park right away. She's also fun to talk to and a kind soul.",positive
"I've been getting my hair cut here by Kelsey. She does a great job every time. She listens to what I want, and gives helpful suggestions. I'm always happy with my cut, and it grows out beautifully in between. The salon itself is a cool space. Highly recommend!",positive
"Kelsey just gave me the best haircut of my life! I'm obsessed with my new hair, and I'm someone who usually doesn't care about my hair. I can go months and months without getting a cut and style. Kelsey is crazy talented, professional, courteous, and super nice too. I just moved to Pittsburgh from the Bay Area, CA and already found my new amazing stylist. Thanks Kelsey see you for my next cut!",positive
"I have been going to Mint for a few months now, and have been extremely pleased with everything about it. Kelley is my stylist, and she does both my hair and my daughter's hair. First off, she really listens to what you want to do, and gives suggestions and ideas based on the look you are going for. I've left the salon thrilled each time she has done my hair. And my daughter, who goes for the crazy, trendy colors, loves her look each time as well. And, Kelley does one of the best wavy blow-outs that I have ever had. The last one I had lasted from Saturday until Thursday in hot, humid weather...and she doesn't charge extra for it either. Kelley is also personable and funny, and makes the experience of sitting for a bit with color on your hair entertaining and fun. It also seems like what I pay for my services is really reasonable. I've gone to salons before where I have walked out after getting the same services with a much larger bill at the end.",positive
"I just had my haircut by Kelsey. I am a very very haircutting anxious Customer to put it gently, and I had not had my haircut in over a year because of a bad haircut experience previously. Kelsey took 6 inches off of my overgrown haircut, called me down off the ledge of doing my layers, and gave me an amazing haircut and took so much extra time to help me understand what was happening with my hair, and did an amazing amazing job. I can't recommend her highly enough. And this is coming from someone who is willing to pay $50 to get my haircut, and it was not $50 here, actually was inexpensive considering high-end haircuts. I had just heard about the salon from a total stranger who's haircut I just happen to like, got a same day appointment, and it is one of the best haircuts I've ever had. I can't say enough good things about it.",positive
"Mint is such a little gem! Kelley & her team are just lovely and fun. I've had my hair cut & dyed at Mint quite a few times and have been thrilled with my hair every time. It's not easy to find a good salon for cut & color work, but I'm so happy that I was referred to Mint by a friend of a friend. Beautiful, precision cuts + the decor is cool & fun. It just feels like an awesome, cozy and special place. In short, Mint rocks!",positive
"I needed a haircut badly, and figured a stylist in training couldn't go too wrong with it. Not only was Kelsey friendly and professional, but I got one of the best haircuts I've ever had for $5. This is definitely my new go-to place.",positive
"Kelley is amazing. I have been with Kelley for a good five or six years now and I don't think I could go to another stylist. She is an awesome colorist, and I always leave the salon feeling and looking great. Highly recommended.",positive
"Fantastic first experience at Mint Salon! I am more than impressed with Kelsey, their newest stylist. She had a great personality; very upbeat and friendly. Since she has not had a lot of experience, the process did take longer than usual, but it was well worth the wait! She has great attention to detail and made sure no hair was out of place before I walked out of that salon. Not only do they provide excellent service, it came at an amazing deal: $15 to shampoo, cut, and dry my hair (promotion for Kelsey to build experience). Thanks for taking good care of me today! This is definitely my new go-to salon in Pittsburgh!",positive
"VERY UNPROFESSIONAL SALON AND NO CUSTOMER SERVICE. I arrived a half hour early for my hair appointment and waited in my car down the street. I was Kelley's first appointment and when I tried to open the door it was locked only to find out the salon had moved. They never bothered to inform me of this or send me a flyer or email. I frantically tried to call two times in a row only to get their answering machine. ""When I did hear back from them I hurried to get to the new location. The girl said if it was anything after 15 minutes she would have to reschedule me. I proceeded to tell her I am within 5 minutes of their new location but she said it is too late. I told her I am late because nobody bothered to tell me they moved since my last appointment. She was very cold and uncaring that I had driven an hour away (from Westmoreland County). I asked to speak to the owner Kelley but she refused to let me talk to her. She said she was busy. How could she be busy when I was her first appointment? It was obvious to me the owner and the rest of the staff could care less about their customers. I have never been late for an appointment because I always pride myself to be early. After further conversation with my friends we will not be back.",negative
"I've been going to see Kelley for about 7 years now, well before she opened Mint. I've had a wide variety of hair styles over that span of time, from long to a bob to a pixie and back again (and in various colors,) and Kelley has nailed it every single time. Her staff is courteous, professional, and very friendly. I have and will continue to recommend her to people looking for a new stylist.",positive
I've been to mint for a cut twice now and I love it. I have thick curly/wavy hair that does whatever it wants. My first visit to mint was the first haircut I had since I moved to Pittsburgh and I was ready for a big chop. I was nervous and Danielle put me right at ease. 12 inches gone! It felt great. Then she washed and cut my hair. I never felt better. My new short hair was exactly what I wanted. My second visit I requested Danielle again and wanted to really give my new short hair a style and some lift. Danielle listened and made my hair look better than I thought possible! I love mint and will continue to schedule appointments there!,positive
"I loved my experience at Mint with Danielle! I'm new to Pittsburgh and wanted to find an affordable but good salon in Shadyside. Danielle listened to what I wanted and executed it perfectly! The salon was clean, the atmosphere relaxing. I recommend anyone and everyone to book an appointment with Kelly or Danielle. I'll be back!",positive
Kelly is amazing. I have a lot of curly hair and she is a magician with it. I always come out of the salon feeling like a rockstar.,positive
This place is insanely good. Jennifer is such a great stylist. She did my hair cut and suggested some highlight and the result was more than amazing. I've received so much compliments for my new hair cut and I can't recommend this salon more,positive
"Kelley-the owner-has been my stylist for years. I was so happy and excited when she opened her own salon because I knew that not only would she employ the best stylists, but that her place would look amazing! The salon is super unique-my favorite part is that they have a rotating art gallery with an opening every few months with food and wine! Back to the hair-Kelley always knows exactly what color to pick and I always love it. Sometimes I come in wanting a little change but not sure what, and I have always left extremely happy with what she does. I actually live in LA now and no other stylist can come close. Whenever I come back to Pittsburgh, Mint Salon and Gallery is my first stop!",positive
"Got a trim on Christmas Eve. Called upfront around 10 AM and was connected immediately. Daniel was very detailed and worked with my hair with great patience (I have very thick hair). I asked if I could keep the current length and thin out, and after the shampoo, cut (trim) and drying, she patiently worked on thinning out my hair. I thought all the questions she asked me were precise (where I wanted to part my hair, if I wanted to keep the length of my bang which was longer than the rest, etc.) and I'm happy with the outcome. This is my second haircut in the US... My first experience at a ""high-end"" salon was not good so I wasn't expecting to be satisfied, but such a pleasant surprise! Also, the conversation throughout was warm and pleasant. I'm the one who likes to watch the process instead of talking, plus the language difficulty as being a foreigner, doubles up making me more silent, but I enjoyed the conversation. Unfortunately, I'm not too happy with the shampoo (no capes or towels put on to avoid getting wet) therefore the 4 stars. (Maybe this is something I will be facing anywhere and everywhere.) The artworks on the wall are giving a nice unique taste.",positive
"I've been a client of Kelley's for about 10 years now. This salon really embodies what can describe Kelley as a stylist - fresh, unique and modern. I always have a hard time figuring out what I want to do with my hair. I love that Kelley gives me imput and really takes her time to make sure I'm getting exactly what I want ( even when I don't know what that is). You can really tell that this is her passion. She always picks the perfect color for me. And when I'm ready for a change, she always has something even more perfect already in mind. And the color really stays! I have to wash my hair every day & I can go six weeks with no problem! The other thing that makes me love this place even more is the rest of the staff. Everyone is so welcoming that you really feel like you're in a room with a bunch of friends. The energy in this place is just infectious! You can really tell when people truly enjoy working with each other, which makes for a comfortable, enjoyable & pleasant experience. And did I mention there's wine??",positive
"Look no further. You've just found your new go-to, #1, favorite salon! Mint has a hip, modern, comfortable, relaxed, fresh feel. You'll feel welcome as soon as u step foot in the door by the warm and friendly staff. My mom and I go every couple weeks. She loves the way Kelley styles her. She's never been able to find someone to style her hair exactly how she describes! She leaves with exactly what she wanted every time! Kelley is a professional, seasoned stylist blessed with a gift of making her clients look good!",positive
"If you have asian hair, go here. Brandy has really good scissor technique which is great for getting texture on what is considered difficult hair. She is leaps and bounds better than others in pittsburgh (or california or boston for that matter)",positive
"Love this salon and the stylists that work there. I live in Greensburg, Pa with plenty of hair salons around, but make the 45 min drive every few weeks to see Dani. She is extremely knowledgeable about color and is more then willing to try something new. If you are looking for a fresh look stop into Mint salon and ask for Dani! She won't disappoint!",positive
"I highly recommend Mint Salon & Gallery and Kelley specifically. She has been cutting my hair for about 8 years, and I have followed her to several salons. I have a bit of a complicated haircut, and she always does it perfectly. You will also love the decor of the salon, with vintage pieces and rotating art on the walls for purchase. Plus, you can enjoy a glass of wine or other beverage before your haircut. How many salons offer that?!",positive
"I love Mint Salon. You will not walk out disappointed. .The girls do a great job of keeping their clients looking modern, fresh, and hip. Fun atmosphere. Kelly is an artist...The only person who has ever given me a killer cute short haircut...goes into place almost on its own due to the precision of the cut....and she does a fab job on my b f's hair..guys trust me it's worth a few more bucks than a mall haircut, you can see the difference.",positive
"Dante Salon changed owners a few months ago and is now called Mint Salon. The new owner, Kelly, clearly has no customer service skills nor any regard for the satisfaction of her clients. I suspect she will be out of business very, very soon. I'm about to write a novel, but the summary is that there are plenty of other good salons in the area and Dante/Mint does NOT deserve your business!! Danielle is the one who attempted to color my hair. She failed miserably. I went in to see if I could get a color consultation appointment and I talked to Danielle about doing on ombre on my slightly-longer-than-shoulder-length hair. I know that ombre is typically done on darker, longer, more layered hair, but I have seen it look really nice on hair similar to mine. I have never had my hair colored before, so I asked lots of questions to make sure I was going to get exactly what I wanted. I explained to her why I wanted an ombre: I wanted some sort of color change, but don't want it to grow out noticeably, and ombre is just color on the ends of the hair, which is perfect. Danielle said that she just learned a new technique to ombre hair in a more subtle way, and we agreed that sounded like a good idea because of my hair length and color. I ended up with a weird mixture of chunky and stringy highlights that didn't quite touch my roots. It looked awful. Absolutely not an ombre by ANY means. But, since I'd never had my hair colored before, it took me a day or so to realize how botched it was. I called them and explained that I don't think I got what I asked for, and if I could come back in to have them fix it. The receptionist was really polite and sweet and told me to come back in and they would take care of it. Round two, I should not have trusted Danielle again. She put a color lifter on my ends and called it a day, only after charging me for the product and a crooked trim. It looked even worse. Again, I should have realized before I left, but I felt like I was under a lot of pressure. Danielle and Kelly consulted with each other within my earshot about how they -did- give me an ombre, and just in general made me feel like I was being a huge problem for them. I made sure to be extra polite but it didn't seem to matter. I ended up going to Nadia Salon on Walnut Street where Lee saved my hair. However, the damage that Danielle did was so extensive that he had to cut off a bunch of dead ends, fix the crooked trim, and apply color to my roots to cover the highlights--- all of these things could have been avoided if only Danielle had actually given me the hair I asked for, instead of defending herself and using me as a guinea pig for this so called ""new technique"". I went back to Mint/Dante and (politely, again) asked to speak with the owner. She was with a client, so I asked her if she would have time to speak with me today at all. She flat out said ""nope""! I understand that she was busy but that was so rude. It's a small place (same 4 stylists each time I was there) so I am positive she recognized me. Danielle was at the front desk and I told her that even though I came back to have my hair fixed, I am still not happy with it, and would like to know if I could get some sort of refund. She gave me Kelly's card and said I could email her. (I brought my boyfriend with me so that I wouldn't back down) He politely said that I have already spent a lot of time/money here, and I don't want emailing her to be another big ordeal. We were there to clear the air and talk with the owner before writing a bad review somewhere. Danielle said Kelly would be able to talk with us in 15 minutes. We waited 25 minutes while listening to them talk about how my hair looks worse now (it doesn't). After that, I left my email and told Kelly she could contact me to work something out. Then I got the f*** out of there. I'm sure other stylists there have done good work, and normally I would say that the stylist does not represent the whole of the salon, but Kelly was unbelievably rude. She is the owner of the salon and therefore she must own up to the work of her stylists. I would be willing to edit this review if she contacted me for a refund, but it really doesn't seem like that's her style. Please, please don't give them your money. Picture of my hair after the first visit: i.imgur.com/E853WIg.jpg i.imgur.com/2Z10s4Z.jpg That's supposed to be an ombre.. After she ""fixed it"": i.imgur.com/PMJL5KA.jpg i.imgur.com/G81QvMX.jpg",negative
"I made an appointment with a stylist, and she gave me a cute hair cut. I like the change of hair style so I'm giving a positive comment. The stylist is very careful. Besides, the location of the salon is really good. Bus could get there. People are nice.",positive
I lived in Los Angeles and have gone to many salons in Beverly Hills and paid top dollar. I was looking for something like that. I went here and let me say I am so happy about my hair!! I wanted a completely new look with bangs. I was very scared getting this done with a new hairdresser. But wow!! I am so happy with my hair! It looks exactly like the picture I brought in!! Haley was my hairdresser. She is down to earth and very nice!! I am defiantly going to be her regular!! This place has a great price!!!! Very affordable!! My hair looks better then what I paid in LA and I got it way cheaper!! I wish I could've tipped more!! I defiantly recommend coming here!!! And Haley is the best!!,positive
"I just got back from an appointment with Haley, and I am extremely happy with my cut! I've been wanting to get bangs for a while now and finally decided to, still with some hesitation. Haley was extremely helpful in helping me decide how to get them cut and suggesting what would look best. She also made sure to ask me as she was going if I liked how they looked. The rest of the cut looks amazing as well, I couldn't be happier! Plus, as a poor college student, the price for a cut with her is very reasonable.",positive
"My fiance and I moved to Pittsburgh in June. As every lady knows, finding a new stylist can be daunting. I initially just got a haircut to see if I felt comfortable at Dante, which Haley executed perfectly. A couple months later, my hair still looked great, but I figured I'd give color a try there as well. Brandy asked just the right questions to get me the effect I was going for. I got partial foil highlights, a cut, and a blowout. Their prices are extremely reasonable for the attention to detail you get at this salon. They have very high quality products as well, which left my hair smelling and looking great even the next day. Even the front desk is extremely friendly and helpful. Thanks Dante Salon, for making a girl feel at home!",positive
This lady sophia use to own Laguna day spa on eastern. She is a horrible person. She messed up my eyebrows. I cried after I left. I looked all overthe internet for a solution. I found another woman at a different place to remove. Sophia was rude she wouldn't give my money back. I went back and she was so crazy called the cops on me. I had my two children with me. She is horrible.,negative
"I was bribed with my refund to delete my review. I read on the yelp website that it is illegal to bribe to alter or delete my review. So here it goes, I first found Sophia from Groupon. I called other businesses, but she was the first to get back to me. I was planning Mother's Day and I didn't realize I should really look into her work and herself as a business. I didn't think much of it, because she was located inside of Canyon Falls Spa and Salon, where i have previously had hair extensions done and was an awesome job. I arrived at Canyon Falls, and Sophia was sleeping in her room. The receptionist texted and had to continuously call her and woke her up. I should have left and went with my gut feeling, since i had my 3 year-old with me. I showed her pictures of what i wanted. She rushed me through explaining it and kept saying yeah yeah i make it look good. And drew outlines, didn't measure and reassured they would be even and smaller than the outlines. Since this is her profession and i have had my eyebrows done twice before and came out wonderful, i thought she knew what she doing. 3 1/2 hours later, a mistake that i will live with constantly every day looking into the mirror at myself has been made. They weren't even at all. Not the shape i had requested. I decided to treat myself for mothers day, am now emotionally and physically scarred. I will let you be the judge. This isn't like a bad hair cut, this is my face! PERMANENT makeup on my face. I called her an hour later and Sophia told me that she will fix her mistake and i have to do a retouch $50 in a few weeks. I then went to 3 different estiticians and Dr. Smith, they all had the same terrible news: SHE MESSED UP MY FACE and they were in disbelief she was liscenced. She refused to give me a refund and hung up on me when i let her know the situation. A MONTH LATER, she called me and asked me to bring my laptop and meet her at BJ's Bar and she will bring a money order. I asked her to bring cash instead. I lost trust in her from everything that has happened. She then met me. 2 hours it took, to get my refund back. I had to get the bartender involved and be the mediator. Anyway, i decided to write this, in hopes to save other fellow women of making one of the biggest mistakes of their lives.",negative
I suggest anyone who is looking for permanent makeup or microblading do their research first. Sophia has been from salon to salon. With 1 star reviews at each place. Look at Laguna Spa.,negative
This is my first time microblading! My eyebrows came out better than I expected. I was there for a couple hours with Sophia. She took her time with me until they were perfect. She went over which style I wanted and everything. I would definitely recommend her anytime.,positive
"NO stars If I could! This woman Sophia ruined my eyebrows!!!!!!!!!! I have cried for days and I have went to consultations all over in hopes to find someone fixing Sophias HUGE mistakes. I'm truly traumatized and will NEVER, EVER let anyone touch my face again thanks to her. I am filing a formal complaint with the cosmetology licensing board bc I don't want someone else's precious brows get destroyed or ruined.. :( thanks to her she ruined natural shapes and plucked one side of eye brows to point where I have no hair ! She also said not one person will get microblading done right first time on customers and customers always have to come back for it to look perfect. Really? Bc alot of my friends have had microblading and done RIGHT FIRST TIME !!!. She basically gave me a hard time to give me my money back and kept saying she'll fix it. Sorry no I won't allow her to make even more and bigger mistakes thn she already did first time. Finally she got it in her head that I just wanted my money back and be done!!!",negative
"I went here last Friday for a quick polish change. I was able to get a seat right away because the rest of the world was at happy hour. Lassime, (wrong spelling?) my nail tech was super sweet and VERY precise with her work. I spent most of my time chatting and laughing with Tim and the rest of the team. The shop offers a lot of services so it can be a one stop shop. Overall, I had a nice experience and would recommend a friend to go here if you're in need of a last minute primping. P.S. they're open until 8!!!!!",positive
"Small hole in the wall (literally), not so clean, grungy, cheap nail salon. I tried this place 3 times because although my nails always sucked and broke EVERY time, the staff is really friendly and nice. I give up on this place because I'm sick of going in every 5 days for them to fix a broken nail or a nail that astonishingly just pops off. The purpose of paying for nails is to have pretty hands and flaunt them, but I always found myself hiding my nails because they always looked so bad :( every other place I go, I can always last 3 weeks without a fill and I never get broken nails! At this place, I got broken nails on the reg. I would have acrylic glopped on the sides and onto my nails, uneven nails, and smudgy polish. Horrible! The inside is not nice, they need to remodel and invest in some better nail products. I would never recommend this place.",negative
"I was not impressed with this place. I called because I wanted a last minute manicure and it was close by. The woman on the phone quoted me their special price of $25 for a gel manicure. The man doing my nails was nice, but it was weirdly quiet in there. No music or anything. I had a glitter overcoat on my nails and, while I appreciate that he was trying to get a lot of glitter on my nails, it turned out lumpy. He had to fix two nails and there was another lump I didn't bother asking him to fix. And the Polish is off the nail on a few fingers... When I went to pay, he said it was $35, not $25! When I said what I had been quoted he said that was fine. But, even though it said they take card, he asked me to go to the grocery store next door and get cash out. Which required me to buy something. Then they only have multiples of $10, so I paid him $30 (after I had already tipped him) and he didn't offer to give me change. I don't think I will be going to this place again.... I ended up paying as much as I would have at a higher end place anyways.",negative
"This place is NOT closed! As of July 8th, 2013 they are open! Mindy did my nails - they took a long time, but she did lots of detail and charged me a more than reasonable amount. She and Tim the Nail Man are definitely the go-to people there. Definitely recommend. Suggest any design - they can do it!",positive
"The good reviews surprise me...honestly. I popped in here because it's nearby my house and it's open late. I typically go to Pink Polish and eventually I'll learn to just KEEP going there! I had ""Tim the Nail Man"" as he calls himself. He was friendly enough and open to my design suggestions which is HUGE in my book. Hence, two stars. The only thing I didn't like as far as a nail tech goes was that he didn't wipe the shellac away from the edges of my nail. Once it hardened it actually went a little onto my skin which is weird and somewhat uncomfortable. As I said, the designs were cute - I told him what I wanted nail by nail and he was happy to do whatever I suggested. =) It's in the dark corner right by pranksters and a second hand store. I wouldn't personally call it cozy myself. The inside was not well-kept. There were a few gnats over by the pedi station so I just skipped that option all together. And while I was getting my nails done there was an ant on the towel under my hands. He brushed it away.....thank you? So, the two upsides. 1) The nail designs I requested turned out well. 2) They had 'My Best Friends Wedding' on the TV. For how friendly Tim was I wish that it as a little cleaner in there. Sanitary nail salons is IMPORTANT when they are poking you with tools. The tools were not pulled from those plastic bags you've seen so you don't know the cleanliness of those when the establishment itself was not clean. I will not be returning to this salon.",negative
"Love this place. Right down the street from my house and best thing they stay open until 8. Just like one of the other reviews said, they don't have a problem staying. I went in about 730pm to get a gel mani and gel pedi, the older lady took about an hour or so on my pedi, and even after was willing to do my mani. How sweet! Of course I told her I'd come back the next day, which yes I did. I love the guy, he is very friendly and loves talking. They are amazing with the massages!! Prices aren't bad, totally worth the services. And yes, they have tanning beds, eyebrow services, and do hair too. I definitely recommend this place!",positive
"Went in for acrylics on Friday and it was horrible! I've been getting acrylics for years and it has never been a problem to have them filed down...until this time. The tip of one finger was filed down so bad that it's blistered. (At least the nail tech put some antiseptic on it so it's not infected.) Also, when I put some lotion on my hands Tuesday a lot of my nails started getting sticky and filmy like they were going to disintegrate. NOT NORMAL! I removed mine today and found that my nails were finely filed, so it looks like they would have fallen off soon anyway. I'm not going back there again.",negative
"Terrible experience here. They cut up my foot when trying to remove a callus. Also, they told me they used shellac when it was really gelish. Wish I could recommend, but I wouldn't want anyone else to go through the same experience.",negative
"My natural nails were a mess so I decided to get acrylics. I looked on Yelp for a place close by, read the reviews and decided on Nail Tech Spa. My appointment was at 2:00. At 1:58 I called and said I would be a few minutes late, but I was close by. I arrived at 2:04 and was asked to sit and wait. 10 minutes later, I was told ""five more minutes"". I was finally seated in front of the nail tech at 2:45. I won't ""down"" rate the guy for this, though because he had run into an unexpected problem with the girl before me so it took longer than expected. My nail technician's name was Tim. I think he did a pretty good job. None of my nails have lifted so far (I just had them done yesterday). I didn't notice the variety of pre-painted nail tips hanging in cases on the wall until Tim had already stuck a few white ones on my fingers for a french manicure. Next time I have a new full set put on, I will try the pre-painted nails. I'll be back (mainly because I left my favorite water bottle there. I hope they saved it for me.)",positive
"AWESOME! This place is located in a nice cozy corner in the plaza on the SE corner of Thomas and Hayden. They do such a great job on your nails and they last forever! Not sure f they use some special serum to make them stay but-by god-it stays. Plus, they have a movie playing every time, not just muted TV so you can actually sit back and enjoy your service with some entertainment. I always end up watching something new as the owner goes to Blockbuster twice a week to have the newest releases there for everyone. Even cooler-they have tanning beds there, do waxing and eye brow shaping. This place is 'da bomb (and you know it's true because i never use that term ;) Hope this review helps put it on the map some more because they are so friendly and affordable. You'll love it.",positive
"I'm new to Ohio and needed an excellent hair salon I came across the reviews on yelp and they were not wrong about this place! I called this morning they got me in within a few hours and did a fantastic job! I will make sure I only use this hair salon! Jessica C is amazing !!! She treated me so well, was nice and listened to everything I said to make sure my hair turned out perfect! 5 stars from me!",positive
"I have been coming to NINA MICHELLE SALON for 14 years and more specifically to Mary Hora! No other stylist/hair artist is allowed to touch my crowning glory! Mary is a color specialist and stylist extraordinaire!!! Toni greets clients with a friendly smile. I always leave feeling pampered, relaxed and years younger! I do not hesitate to recommend this salon and Mary to you!",positive
"Very pricey for a cut and blow dry, but they use high end products and are thoughtful about the way they style your hair.",positive
Seriously impressed with Jessica. Wanted something new and she worked with me to develop a bunch of ideas that would actually be doable with my hair. Worth every penny and then some. Felt like a new man.,positive
I love Nina Michelle salon. My girl Dawn is the 'best' at making you feel beautiful & everyone there is amazing & welcoming.,positive
"Nina Michelle is the worst salon I've been to. The receptionists lost my appointment, the hair stylist damaged my hair with color and over charged me for a process I didn't ask for. Another hair stylist ignored what I asked for a cut and gave me the worst cut ever. Nina, the salon manager was negligent with even fixing any of these issues. Very unprofessional and greedy salon.",negative
"I have been to Kelly three times now. I have insanely thick hair and am trying to grow it out, and she takes such good care of me! In the past haircuts always took what seemed like hours, but she gets me in and out and it doesn't feel rushed at all. She does great work, and I highly recommend this place and Kelly to anyone in the area.",positive
"I had Dawn do a trim and bayalage treatment on my hair. I love it!! She provided a great consultation and knew what would look best. It is always nerve wracking going somewhere new for the first time, but I felt very comfortable. Wonderful salon, will be returning!",positive
If i could i wound give this place 0 stars. Its a dump. Pay a little extra and go get yourself a decent hair cut. Luis is either jabbering with walk in customers or his other workers during a cut. I give him instructions he does what he feels like anyway. Im leaving this place for good after coming here for a few months,negative
"I had a lousy haircut at this location by an older filipinos women, it was uneven and bad experience overall, worst haircut i've ever had.",negative
"The sign on the outside says ""Parkwood's Unisex Hairstylists"" so it is open to everyone. I've had haircuts from Kiko. Luis, Anna, and Olan. They all do excellent work. The cost is reasonable. Waiting is strange. There are no numbers. Some people are waiting for a specific barber and others are not. They know. You don't. So you might have 6 people waiting ahead of you and you could still be next. If it's a lot of younger guys waiting, they are most likely there for Kiko but not necessarily. There are usually women customers too. They tend to go to one of the two female barbers - excuse me- stylists.",positive
Great haircuts... humble barbers... welcoming environment... ask for Kiko or Luis but if the barber works there I'm sure you wouldn't be disappointed,positive
"Awesome place, great staff and excellent cut. I used to go to another place for years but switched over here after my first cut. They make you feel welcomed and Anna is awesome. Highly recommended!!!",positive
"Anna is my usual barber, she has amazing skills, but I think she's a little underestimated. I stopped paying 45 dollars + tip for haircuts ever since I found this place. Not only is she amazing at what she does she is no nonsense and does her job exactly how you want it. Terrific place! No more 45+ dollar haircuts when you get better service here. Give it a try!",positive
Great place. Friendly staff. Would recommend. This is CASH only. The food basics nearby offers cashback if you need to withdraw some :).,positive
"Loved my first visit, $15.50 a cut for men but the best part was the service, very professional and I felt just like at home. Switching my barber over here",positive
"Great place to get a very affordable men's haircut, complete with a professional straight blade and hot shaving cream finish!! Family run business for over 30 years.",positive
"I've had all but two haircuts in my life at Parkwoods Men's Hairstyling (30 years worth). This place is so much more than a barber shop to me; I have a really strong sentimental attachment to it. Anna and Lui (husband and wife/owners) are exceptional at what they do. Their attention to detail is impeccable, and their sense of humour and pleasant disposition makes getting my hair cut an enjoyable experience. Just to show you how nice these people are -- my older brother was extremely ill with a disease, and was unable to leave his house to get his hair cut. Anna went out of her way and came to him, and refused to take any money. That's the kind of people they are; pure class. I will continue to give them my business as long as they're open.",positive
"Disappointed. I tried this barber shop on the weight of one 'Yay! I'm a fan.' and one 'Woohoo! As good as it gets!' rating. The store is modest, old-fashioned and clean. The owner/staff are very friendly and seem eager to accommodate. The price is cheap. ($15.50 for my cut, including tax.) I called ahead to see if appointments were necessary (they're not) and if they could do a classic (old-fashioned) men's hair cut called a 'short back and sides'. I was assured that 'they all could do that'. Considering that I have had no luck finding a satisfactory execution of this seemingly easy to do cut, I showed up with a how-to diagram from an on-line catalogue of cuts and styles. The cut was just okay. It wasn't exactly was I was hoping for (and didn't match the schematic I provided), but I can certainly live with it. Marks deducted for needing to tidy up around one ear after getting home. Still need to decide if I'll go back and give them another shot or if I'll keep looking...",negative
"I tried this place after reading Jim's review. The place is nice, not too fancy and the service is great. I was very pleased with the hair-cut and for sure will go there again.",positive
"I've been getting my hair cut here for about 15 years, and I won't go anywhere else until my barber, Anna, retires. This is an old-school barber shop where you can get your hair cut for $15, with a shave for around $7 if you wish. The staff are very friendly and have been in the trade for a very long time. I highly recommend this place. It's a little hard to find if you don't know if it's there, as it's in the middle of Parkwoods Mall, which is an old-style Don Mills plaza, but it's worth stopping in, trust me.",positive
"Updating my review: I've been going here since my first review was posted and have always had no issues with the ladies who do the eyebrow threading. I went on a weekday (Wednesday) near closing time and oh god, a lady I've never had before took off a good chunk of both my brows for some unknown reason. I now have an ocean between my two eyebrows and I am so disappointed. (I hope it grows back quickly. Side note: immediately after this eyebrow disaster, I bought Full Brow Serum at Province Apothecary to grow back my newly created bald spots and it really has helped! So if my reality happens to you too, you're welcome.) I was noticing the threading took longer than usual and I thought, wow she must be putting a lot of effort into this! But no, not a good sign. I was still too non-confrontational and just said they look good and gave her a tip, but inside, I was weeping silently. WHY, WHY would someone think it's a good idea to remove like 2 cms of hair on the ends between the brows when there was no unibrow there before nor does it aesthetically look better to have such a wide space between two eyebrows??? I question whether she knew she effed up or she just has no visual comprehension of what looks good/bad and it's just a lack of skill as a previous reviewer mentioned. I would recommend the other ladies (which is why I left it at a 2 and not a 1) but not the one that wears a good amount of foundation. Nice person and all but wow, she must've realized that she took off way too much of my eyebrows that I look like a crazy person.",negative
"I've come here upon occasion over the past 5+ years. And each time I've walked away seriously disappointed. For some reason the staff here think they know what you want without ever asking you first. Which was why I would only come here when desperately in need of an eyebrow fix. And each time I would walk away with thin eyebrows (I naturally have thick and big eyebrows. I no longer go here for eyebrows, it's just not worth it. However, I had a specific recent incident I'd like to share with you about the staff at this location. I decided to get a full face without eyebrows done. What do you consider a full face? Because I consider it to be just that, my full face, without eyebrows. Apparently, the staff here feel otherwise. Or rather, they are highway burglars. Let me explain. I got myself those email coupons Perfect Threading offers, you sign up online. I set my appointment for 7pm (because apparently 7:15pm would have been late for them). I rushed over there after work on a Wednesday. I showed my coupon -- Wednesday's deal was something like 10% off, possibly with student ID. I was told that this coupon would not work for Full Face w/o Eyebrows since ""it's already discounted."" Uhmmm okay, the cost of this service is $26.55 (and up). So we get started. This lady does everything on my face below my nostrils. Then steps back as if she's done. I tell her to do between my brows and forehead area, and cheeks. She does. THEN SHE CHARGES ME FOR FULL FACE. Which is $30. The other staff member protested in Urdu/Hindi. She said ""but it's w/o eyebrows,"" to which my lady responded, ""I went up to her forehead. They did not think I could understand them. Excuse me?! I didn't fight it. I even tipped her. BUT I AM DONE WITH THIS PLACE. It is full of thieves who consistently take off more of your hair than you'd like. What is the point of having coupons if you won't accept them? What is the point of having prices if you're going to charge willy-nilly. Oh, by the way, there was no one there until I left at 7:15pm, the appointment time I initially wanted. It's not that paying over $30 was too much extra money. It's about the price you post, the deals you offer and not honouring either of those things. Moreover thinking you can charge me more because I don't understand what you're saying, because I don't look like you. Moreover, you're not even good at the service you're providing. You never ask what the customer actually wants, and do what you think is best. But what makes you an expert at knowing what's best for any particular person? I know these stores have almost a cult following due to prices and deals and the overall efficiency and timely service. However, you can find comparable pricing and better service elsewhere.",negative
Overcharged me - I was supposed to be charged $11 for the Wednesday Eyebrow & Upper Lip Threading not $15. Not happy about this. I was in a rush and didn't realize until I left that I was overcharged. I have been going to the Perfect Threading chain for a few years now and this was very disappointing. They were also distracted and talking to each other very loudly. They rushed the service. They left all the hair on my face and didn't give me gel. I would not recommend this location.,negative
"They thread eyebrows for men, which is good; some of these types of places refuse to do eyebrows for men, and some will only do it if you come in with a female friend. I walked in at a busy time and was served after 15 minutes, which wasn't too bad. The location is small and compact, from what I remember only have four chairs total. The person doing my eyebrows was friendly and efficient. The price was a little more than I expected, in scarborough I pay $7, I was charged $11.50.",positive
"I've been to this place twice since moving downtown, the people there are friendly and they offer a lot of services, such as man haircut for $9. I went there for threading and my first time was great I loved the shape of eyebrows, the girl removed all the tiny little hair away. I saw that they had a combo offer for Wednesday's $11 for eyebrows and upper lip and decided to give it a try. I think because they had so many people coming in for the combo my eyebrows were not at its greatest shape when I left. Overall a good place, but I would recommend to go during less busy days or hours.",positive
"I'm reviewing for Eyebrow threading only. But my experience doesn't let me want to try anything else there. I come to this location only because its very convenient but whenever I leave I regret it. It was no different this time. The eyebrow threading is very mediocre. Like the most ordinary job ever with a 50% chance of a screw up. I tried 3 different people (each time thinking it could be better by a different lady) but this wasn't the case. Yesterday my eyebrows looked completely different from each other and messed up. If i'm paying $10 I better be happy with it. I would not recommend this place. If you still want to take a chance on your looks, take it elsewhere. Atleast you'll have a better chance of having it done right.",negative
"Just came back from their eyebrow and upper lip threading combo for $11 and the lady who did it for me did an amazing job. She was quick, fast and professional. It was my first time threading and it was surprisingly more painful than I thought. However, due to the amazing results, this is going to be my go to method for facial hair removal. I will be back!",positive
"Don't come here. I had the ends of one of my eyebrows chopped up like by 1 mm. It looks awful and uneven while my other eyebrow is longer. She didn't thread the middle area in between my eyes. While getting my brows threaded I heard, the girl at the cash ask ""if this is your first time, here's a card, one free time after 10 times"". When I went up to pay, nobody offered me that. I had to say: it's my first time, do you have some sort of loyalty program? No lotion was applied afterwards. The chairs were dirty (I saw saliva spit on the edge of my reclining chair). It's a bunch of low class chatty Indian women working here with bad manners. Also, I came home and 2 hours later, a nice pimple popped up on the top of one of my brown The best place I've been to for threading is at Trade secrets at Eaton Centre downtown. I am never returning. Price: $9 before tax and tip.",negative
"Went for eyebrow threading, upper lip threading and underarm waxing just before my wedding. Mondays are 20% off waxing and Wednesday is a brow and lip special. They did a great job, were professional and had an appointment for the next day. My eyebrows look wonderful and I am very pleased. The whole thing took only a couple of minutes which was great, leaving me time to walk back up yonge street with a red and puffy face before lunch hour ended. No Frills but good service and excellent price.",positive
It hurts. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise. Threading is less destructive to your skin than waxing but it still hurts. I needed to get my eyebrows back in shape and happened to be wandering through the neighbourhood so I popped in. Nine bucks and ten minutes later my eyebrows are as good as new.,positive
"I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS PLACE GOT FIVE STARS. I typically go to the location at University & College, where there's a very sweet girl who does my eyebrows patiently, nicely, and does a good job. One day I decided to come to this location and I literally walked out with one and a half eyebrows. I don't know wtf was wrong with that lady - not only could I have done my eyebrows better myself but she also pretty much ruined them by trimming half of one off. When I pointed it out, she didn't even apologize and instead said I was being too picky. It's 2 weeks later and in case nobody knows eyebrows take a long time to grow in and my bangs still need to cover them and I nearly cried after walking out of this place. I'm not exaggerating about 1.5 eyebrows on my face - even my boyfriend noticed them and he's a guy. DO NOT GO TO THIS LOCATION. I would give it 0 stars if I could.",negative
I was paying $16.00 taxes included plus tip at a downtown salon until I found this place where I pay $9.05 ( taxes included) and really really love how the Asian lady works: fast and professional! I really recommend this place for threading eyebrows!,positive
"In the grand scheme of things, this is a fast, no frills, grooming hub. However, they are very good at what they do and usually have a daily special. I come here for my brows and have recently started to get bikini waxes. They use the pink cream wax- my favourite. There are 20% off waxing days, and on Wednesday an upper lip / eye brow threading combo deal. They also give a student discount. -- these are the specials that I utilize, I'm not sure what else they offer. There is a stamp card loyalty program. The reward is a free eyebrow threading. I usually drop in as I live down the street. Typically they are able to see me right away or after a ten minute wait. The longest I've ever had to wait was 30 minutes. But I ran some errands so it was no big deal. The spa is small and clean and the girls are fast and courteous. I have found that some will clean up my eyebrows, but I have to tell them I want my eyebrows shaped. Don't be shy, they will do it. Perfect threading is a great no fuss place for weekly maintenance.",positive
"I was looking for a affordable threading place downtown, and this is it. For $8 for eyebrow threading I got fast, professional service. My eyebrows look groomed, but still natural. A very convenient location, less than 2 minute from College station is another plus.",positive
"The newest location for this popular local threading salon chain is conveniently located in the heart of Toronto's Church & Wellesley Village. Close to the the College subway station, and across the street from the enormous Loblaw's at the Maple Leaf Centre, I was hyped that a threading salon opened in the area. The lack of a salon forced me to march over to the University Avenue location every now and then (schedule permitting) to get my brows back in order. Salon is small compared to the chain's other locations, but location is ideal. Great service, reliable threaders, and perfect results will now have me coming back more often as it is not too far from my home. I highly recommend threading over waxing due to the great shape your brows will look, but please be aware that it can be a painful experience for those with sensitive skin. Therefore, make sure to tell your stylist to take breaks every now and then so that you can regain your senses, especially when they're threading the bottom portion of the brow.",positive
"Terrible service! Unsanitary. Worst manicure/pedicure of my life! Along with horrible service! I walked In and she had the tools sitting on the table; I didn't see if they were sanitized or not. She had absolutely no idea what she was doing. She was rough despite my flinching, pushing my cuticles all over the place. At one point I pulled my foot back and yelled. She painted and repainted my toes several times because, again, she had no idea what she was doing. I was contemplating even doing the manicure but had to because I had a Groupon. I had to tell her to push my cuticles back before she started cutting. It seemed foreign to her. The nippers were going all over the place and I was afraid of her cutting SOMETHING off! She was painting my fingernails while they were suspended in midair (imagine that!) Without holding my fingers. I believe her name was mirna or something like that. Not that one person's name matters, they were all just the same because when I told someone how terrible and frightening the experience was, nothing was done about it. Don't even get me started on the checkout process when I told them I had a Groupon! I never went back to use my other manicure/pedicure deal! And needed to get the word out for others to save their money and time and potential loss of fingers/toes!",negative
"I had a positive experience with this salon when I went to redeem my Groupon. My technician was friendly and professional HOWEVER, my Groupon was for 2 manicures and pedicures services. I redeemed one and called back today to redeem my final session. The phone was answered by a less than friendly receptionist who asked me if I had any coupons for my service. I informed her of my Groupon that they should have in their file and how I would like to complete my second session. The receptionist respond ""the Groupons are Voided"". I asked, ""what do you mean they are voided I redeemed the deal before it expired and I still have one more session"". She responded, ""we voided them all"". Once again, I asked ""what do you mean it's voided?"" At that point she informed me the salon is under new management and they will not honor any of the previously sold Groupons. Beware if you have purchased any Groupon for this spa. You should probably contact Groupon and ask for a refund before it is too late. Due to my less than friendly interaction with the receptionist I will not be returning to this spa for services.",negative
Came in as a walk in.. was disappointed in the admosphere. You think with that kind of name it would be a spa type environment but its not. Asked for water like to of never got it. Got my hair colored loved it. Told her only minor trim. She cut my hair too short. Especially my bangs which I told her dad just fine. Love the color hate the cut. Great place for color would go back but not the cut.,negative
"I was getting married and looking for a place to get my nails done along with my bridesmaids the night before the wedding. I saw a Groupon for this place and called prior to purchasing to confirm they could fit us all in around the same time. I was told this wouldn't be a problem. I purchased the Groupon and called to make the appointment and was told there was no way they could fit us all in the night before because they only have 1 nail person after 4pm. This doesnt really make sense to me - not sure why they would cut back on staff once people get off work (this was on a Friday). I told them I had called the day before and they said it must have been a new person who gave me the wrong information. They then told me that some of us would have to book during the day and the other two could come at night. Although this was not ideal and I was not thrilled we made it work. My bridesmaid called the week before and then the day prior to confirm the appointments and they said we were all set. The day of the appointment, they called one of the girls and told them that they had double booked and couldn't fit her in at all that day. When we got there we told them that this was the second time that this had happened and that we were unable to come tomorrow due to the wedding. They managed to fit her in but seemed unhappy about it. The first group went during the day and the girls who did our nails all ""seemed"" nice. Then, the other two bridesmaids came later that night. The nail person was talking trash about us (not realizing the person she was talking trash to was also in the wedding party) saying that it was our fault they double booked and saying how she didnt like the nail colors the bridal party had chosen. My bridesmaid told her she was in the wedding as well and the nail person stopped talking pretty quickly but the damage was done. The moral of this story: Go here if you want bad service, a good chance of them lying to you and/or screwing up appointments, and then talking trash about you when you leave.",negative
I've had two great experiences at Pleasure Paradise in the past month or so. I first tested out the waters with Yvonne and had a lovely mani/pedi. I decided to go ahead and purchase a coupon to have my hair colored/cut/styled by Taryn. I can honestly say this is the first time I have walked out of a salon happy. Usually I walk out praying for my hair to grow faster or for the color to fade. Taryn was a master and did an amazing job. She was extremely friendly and I cannot wait to go back and see both her and Yvonne!,positive
"Hello, I had the pleasure of helping this team of great stylist in redesigning there new website and some promotional video's. These guys are defiantly one of the best salons out here in the west valley, expertise range in all areas when it comes to taking care of your body and making it look good! Defiantly a spot to visit and make it your salon you can call home!",positive
"I was surprised to not see more positive reviews and I am due for adding a new one, so here it is. My mom bought us a package deal for a massage, sparking apple cider lunch, manicure and pedicure. The place is very modern, clean and organized. They have changing rooms, lockers and showers. They even supply everything you need such as soap, body spray, hair dryer and even spray deoderent! First was the massages and don't be affraid to say more or less pressure. There is a waiting area with sofas where the light lunch is served along with sparking cider. I will say the only thing lacking was a tv, we wanted to watch the NASCAR race we were missing. After lunch along with a refill of sparking cider is the manicure/pedicure. It was nice to be in a place with newer pedicure chairs where all the buttons were in tact and working. If you go there, be sure to check out the manicure tables and cabinetry, interesting fact is that the owner's husband is a carpenter and made everything. It's very professional and upscale looking. I was impressed with the staff's knowledge and pride in her job to share. I would love to go back, I could use another ""spa day"" for some relaxation and for some reason the sparking cider tasted better there! **We used a Groupon deal and they were very friendly and we had no trouble at all. Owner (Jess) was very friendly as was rest of the staff.",positive
"Stay far away from this place, they can't color or cut hair, cost me 200. To fix what they screwed up. They have no idea what they are doing, my hair was falling out by the handful after it was fixed, they messed me up big time!!",negative
"I'm always complaining about the lack of customer service in Arizona, but if you go to Pleasure Paradise Salon you will NOT have any customer service complaints! Believe you me! I also had the best massage by Kimber. I'm always having neck / upper back pain because of stress & taking care of a young baby but Kimber gave my upper back so much attention that I finally found relief in my back. And everyone from was so nice! One stop shop for hair, body, & nail care!",positive
Pleasure Paradise is AWESOME! They are super clean & it is VERY nice inside. Their friendly staff & extensive selection of services are fantastic. The prices are very reasonable. Wanda & Greg are very talented. I will be recommending this salon to all my friends & family!,positive
"Absolutely terrible customer service. Whatever you do, do not buy a Groupon from this place. They will tell you that they have availability and schedule you. BUT when the owner (Jess) finds out that you booked with a Groupon he will call and say that you incorrectly booked their services and gives you dates two weeks away. The problem is that it was their employee who booked the reservation! Jess has to be the rudest small business owner I have ever dealt with. Not a good way to do business these days. I guess we will continue to frequent Dolce and get the experience we pay for. Note: the owner's wife called back and apologized for Jess's comments and tried to make accommodations. Unfortunately the damage was already done.",negative
"Great place for all kinds of services. All the stylists are very nice and accommodating. Huge on the inside and very clean. Greg did my spray tan and he was very professional and sweet. I would definitely recommend this salon for anything you need done. :) It is a little expensive, but overall, worth it.",positive
"Michelle is simply THE BEST. I have had other really good stylists before - I've lived in NYC and Montreal - but no one has been as good or as versatile or as open to trying new and interesting things with my curly hair, than her. She has never given me a bad haircut or colour. Ever. I get compliments all the time on my cuts. I completely trust her with my hair, which I have never done with anyone else after growing up in a small town in the 80s! Just last week I described a cut to her because I couldn't find the picture I wanted to show her, and she gave me exactly what I (poorly) described. Pretty crazy. I find most commercial salons exhausting, with tons of people rushing around and pounding music, all stressing me out. At Primped, you will have Michelle's complete attention - no minions to wash your hair - and a fantastic selection of her favourite music to keep you company. It is a calm and relaxing atmosphere, more like going over to your cool friend's house, rather than being in a dance club or a meat grinder. And have I mentioned that she's not just a brilliant stylist and colourist, but also a really great person? I couldn't recommend her more!",positive
"You know you have a great haircut when strangers tell you they love your hair!. No sooner did I get to Queen St W when a woman stopped me and asked me where I got it cut. Right around the corner, I said. Michelle has been cutting my hair for many years, .and it never gets stale. She is a terrific listener, who ""get's my style"" .Sometimes my ""bob"" is longer, or we choose a different cut on my bangs, Her studio uncluttered, and private.. Michelle also has a wonderful election of exotic teas. Happy, loyal customer Lydia Gorinas",positive
"I was looking online for someone new as I was tired of paying 150$ a cut at a salon in yorkville. The reviews are all great so I decided to go see her for a cut, when I went in my hair was past my shoulders midway to my breast. I had long layers my hair has body to it and it would air dry nicely like loose beachy waves. My hair was dry and I agreed to have the length shortened a bit to cut them out, I brought in pics to show exactly what I wanted so there would be no misunderstanding. To explain the length I would always put my hair in a messy bun on the top of my head as I have very thick hair. I was very specific that I don't like undercutting and stuff done to my hair as I like the thickness and big hair. The girl butchered my hair it is choppy short and completely uneven she also toned my hair and midway to the end is gray. When I wanted it be ombré / balayage she put highlights through the crown like in the 90s I was very specific and had pics.. I don't understand how she could have not got what I was explaining especially considering its the trend right now and u can see it in magazines and in the streets. When I left and saw myself in the mirror outside when I got into my car I started crying it looked so bad. I never post reviews especially negative ones but I'm supper pissed my hair looks like I have scissors to a kindergarten kid !! Beware the reviews below they have to be from her friends and not real clients I'm so angry everytime I look in the mirror I want to start crying ! I'm going to post pics so u can see what I mean",negative
Michelle has been doing my hair for five years. I just love her work. She is a genius with colour - so much so that people routinely see her work and think my (mouse brown) hair is naturally blonde. And I've had more compliments on my haircut since Michelle than in all the years before. I'm moving cities soon and will miss her a lot. Recommend!,positive
"Finding a really good hairdresser can be arduous. Luckily my search is over, because I found Michelle at Primped! I needed a major colour process done and was quite nervous about how it would turn out. I shouldn't have worried. Michelle is incredibly laid back and friendly, and her space is really welcoming and fun to be in. She stripped the existing black dye from my hair effortlessly and I emerged with a fabulous new red do, at a price that was much better than the others I had been quoted around town. A great fun experience, and I'm looking forward to my next visit. A++!",positive
"classic quote of the week via text: friend: where you at? me: toronto! friend: what the hell are you doing there? me: getttttting mah hurrrrrrr did friend:..... is that shanghainese ebonics? ah. to have not been raised in los angeles, what a travesty! Michelle Thompson is Toronto's best kept secret. And the only, ONLY reason i'm writing this is so that she'll get overbooked, and open up another location in los angeles. (pretty please?) going through random bouts of social ineptitude and overall bouts of disdain for the average clientele at hair salons (you know what i'm talking about), has precluded me from visiting any substantial hair salon. (in la at least). so through a series of freak accidents (i tried to trim my hair, and four inches later...yep. it happened, and i'm NEVER going near another pair of scissors again), my friend told me not to fret. his exact words: ""i've got the best hair stylist. she'll fix it. she'll make you gorgeous"". pause. ""....not that you're not gorgeous now."" second pause. Michelle's studio is a skip away from the nearest streetcar, so you can literally get off, and walk straight for the blue building. She came out to meet us (in the freezing weather that is Toronto in January), and my spidey senses were tingling. i liked her immediately. ok, it might've been the hot black boots, and her perfect hair. maybe..MAYBE. who doesn't need some eye candy in negative 7 degrees? walking into her studio is like walking in to the tardis from doctor who. the place keeps stretching and stretching. it's an absolute full salon, with all the amenities, and no douchebaggery. tunes are mellow and pumping in the back, and smokey, her lovely grey kitty makes eyes at me while i sit and get my hair detoxified and fixed. chatting with michelle was an absolute pleasure, and seeing the hairstyle come into its own was quite gratifying. With over 20 years of experience, she'll give you an objective opinion on what looks best on you, and though I would have never chosen the specific hairstyle I ended up with, i've gotten nothing but compliments. if you're into quality one on one time, with a person who's sole purpose there is to beautify you, i'd suggest you book her immediately. i can tell you now, no one's touching my hair unless it's Michelle... or Smokey. And to think, all it took was a 5 hour flight out of the country to get my first haircut. Book her. Now. Before I Kidnap Her.",positive
"I got a gift card from my Mother in law for Christmas to try this place out. I scheduled a Thai facial, Express mani with shellac, and a spa pedicure. When I got there i was taken back for my facial. she did the steam and wiped my face and then put a mask on and left the room. she was gone for a solid ten minutes, came back in did the same thing and then left the room again!!! In my experience with facials when you get the mask portion of the facial they do a massage, not here! She didn't do any extractions either, I actually didn't even see any equipment there to do them! They did the wrong facial as well, they ended up giving me a signature facial instead of the thai facial. Also, i didn't go in for my HOUR facial until 9:40 and she was done at 10:20. So i was not happy when i came i out from my facial and actually canceled my pedicure cause i didn't want to waste my money! When i got the manicure they informed me that they hadn't scheduled me for shellac ( even though i was very specific on the phone when i scheduled it) and said that the person that does that isn't available. I told them that was fine, i just wont get the manicure cause regular polish does not stay on my nails. Then all of a sudden they could do it? But now two days later i already have THREE chips and their color selection was very minimal. Instead of being a relaxing experience it was a frustrating and irritating one.",negative
Best massages ever. I drive from an hour away. The room is relaxing and the staff are professional. I've tried other places close to home and nothing measures up to the standards of Q's. I've been coming to this place for 6 years. I'd love for you to open one closer to Mansfield,positive
Owner does not care about good or sub par customer service. She is the reason I tell everyone who asks what a bad experience I've had there. She just doesn't care!!,negative
"The manicurist was rude- just making little digs about how she could tell I'd last clipped my toenails myself, etc- and when I requested a French manicure, she told me she couldn't do one. Could not!! Another manicurist in the room also informed me she couldn't.",negative
I recently went to Qs Spa for the first time I was amazed by the phoenominal customer service they do and all the services they offer! This is by far the premiere Spa in The Medina area and I highly reccomend it!,positive
I have been to q 's spa several of times for different services and have always been pleased. I have had scoliosis and back aches ever since grade school and coming to Q for massages is even better than the chiropractor. She uses great technique. I also used to get my nails and hair done here regularly before I moved and have always been more than pleased. Great customer service. Sad that I had to move because it's hard finding a new spas/salon in cities you are new to.,positive
I am a local golf professional and director of the Greg Jones Golf Academy. Often times my neck shoulders and back are in a lot of pain. I've tried many massage salons and have for the most part been very satisfied with the service and atmosphere. After going to Q's I will only be going there. I was very impressed with the atmosphere and service at Q's Spa. Top notch massage and just what I needed. Golfers needing relief from pain this was a great message and I would recommend them highly. Thank you Greg Jones,positive
"I hate to give this place only two stars, because every service I've ever had done there, aside from one shellac mani, has been wonderful. I've continued to return for hair cuts and highlights and have had several manis and pedis there as a part of different bridal parties. I've attended their ""birthday party"" open houses and have even recommended to a friend who was getting married and several of us from her bridal party went in for multiple services the day before her wedding. The reason behind the two stars is the business ethics - or lack there of! I've had a handful of bad experiences, and after my next scheduled appointment (because I don't want to cancel on my stylist and I like how she does my hair) I will no longer be returning to Q's. Once I had received a coupon in my email for a free haircut with any color...I got a partial highlight with two colors, and a cut, went to checkout and was told that because I wasn't a new customer they couldn't give me that coupon. No where on the coupon, at that time, did it state that I had to be a first time customer...now on every single one they send out it's stated right below the special. I told them that they should acknowledge the coupon because it was their mistake, but Q couldn't understand what I was trying to say and offered me 10% off instead. 10% off was about $11...vs the $35 I spent on the haircut...hmm... The final straw comes with my next and last appointment. In May when I visited with the bridal party Q told me to make sure I wrote my email address down because she wanted to offer me a special for the next time I was in for my hair as a thank you for bringing in so many people for services and exposing her business. Great, that's so nice! Well. I scheduled my appointment online and left a note about this asking she or Phil to call me to discuss so I would know what to expect when I went to checkout. I hate going to the register and being surprised by a HUGE, unexpected bill because there's nothing to do at that point but pay it. I didn't get a phone call, so I took it upon myself to call. I did, left a voice mail asking about it so that I could budget - we're talking about a difference of $75 vs $130+ which is a big deal to me. I get a call back and on my voicemail am again told that if I'm a first time customer I will get a free haircut with any color...great but um..I've been there at least 6 times... I called back, leaving another message, this time with full details, making sure to use terms like ""honor your word"" and ""brought in several girls for multiple services, you offered me a special as a thank you""...I immediately got a call back and had the chance to talk with Q - OH! she had forgotten that she'd marked a $15 off offer on my sheet. Okay great! So then I ask if I can use the $15 off, with the 10% off that I (and everyone else in their mailing list) received in my email. I was told that I couldn't do both together. Well, that stinks, especially because the services I get done actually leave the 10% off as a better deal than the $15 off she gave me as a thank you. Since I can't use them together I was told to ""use the 10% off for this trip and then save the $15 for my next""...basically her way to get me in the door again...that's not going to happen. If you want to thank someone, THANK them, give them a special that is actually a special, and stick to your word. I've had too many conversations that just go around and around and leave me confused and angry that I just give in, pay the money and leave...that's no way to feel after a day at the spa/salon. No thank you. I'll let my stylist know that I won't be returning so that if she leaves, like so many others, she can let me know what salon she ends up at.",negative
"Something hubby and I like to splurge on is massage, specifically couples massage. Just as it sounds, couples massages are body kneading treatments that happen while laying in side-by-side beds in the same dimly lit room. We have had massages outside on a sunny day and inside during a blizzard. I've lost count of how many spas we've been to in the three states we've lived in, but each one had its own flair. The first couples massage we ever booked was at a luxury hotel in Los Angeles. They had us wear disposable underwear (!?) and lay face down as our therapists worked our muscles like silly putty. Our masseuses were short, stocky, Asian women who, at one point, climbed on top of our backs and dug in to our shoulder blades with their knees (!?). A few days ago, we went to a spa in town called Q's Spa. It's owned by a lovely woman named Q, who is petite, yet gives a hardy massage (she gave me mine). We started our visit with a tour of the facility, then were shown to our room where we changed in to white terry cloth bathrobes and slippers. Before the massage, we had a second room all to ourselves, with a display of grapes and strawberries, crackers, wine, and assorted chocolates. The steam closet was only a few paces away, so we alternated between the snack table and the room set to 98 degrees with 3000 percent humidity. Aside from dodging the hot water dripping from the ceiling, it was pleasant. Take-your-breath-away-while-sweating-out-toxins pleasant. Our massages were the highlight of our visit. We each had our own therapist who did well to work out the kinks with their hands and elbows. While they kept their feet on the ground, their use of hot stones sent me to La La Land in no time. After every treatment like this, I am reminded of what butter must feel like slowly melting on top of a Belgian waffle dressed in vanilla cream resting on top of rainbows and cotton candy clouds.",positive
"UPDATE: as soon as I posted my previous review (the next morning), staff had contacted me to see if I would come in and give them an opportunity to fix it. I spoke with Jenna who was so sweet and understanding, really made me feel as though she wanted me to come back and be happy with my hair. Kimberly was the stylist who fixed my hair, she took her time looking at it and even got a second opinion from another stylist, I could tell she really cared that my hair worked out. She spent hours putting in fine highlights, which turned out beautifully and did a great job blending the highlights from before (pictures below). I am actually super excited about my hair now and will definitely be back. I would definitely give 5 stars for the second visit!",positive
"For the last four years I have been in search of a consistent, creative and talented hairdresser. I first heard about RedBloom Salon at a bachelorette party where I met two women who had amazing haircuts and they both had hair stylists from RedBloom. I later discovered that a friend has been seeing the owner for over twelve years but she informed me that he is no longer taking on new clients. When I called to make an appointment they were all quite booked up but I was determined to wait as it has been a struggle for me to find the perfect hairdresser. The salon is located in a shopping complex filled with upscale shops and the salon was no exception. Please note that their address does not work in a GPS so I recommend going ahead of time because it is easy to get lost if you are not familiar with the area like me. When I arrived I was offered tea or coffee while I waited and they had me change into a comfortable smock. My stylist was prompt, polite and very nice to talk to. When she asked what I wanted to have done I told her that she was the artist and asked for her suggestion. Without hesitation she layed out her game plan, then went to the back and priced out two options and brought the info back to me on a small white board for me to view. As I have long hair, my first option was approx $250 for a cut and highlights and second was cheeper but for fewer highlights. I went with the first as I was in dire need of a full makeover...and that is what I left with! Each stylists pricing differs depending on experience. My girl was a mid level rating so I expect that the price varies within the salon. Since then I have returned again to the same girl with the same amazing results. I have another appointment next week.....here are a couple of other things that I look forward to when I go: The ambiance is nice...music is not blaring and the decor is very modern with a slight industrial look. All of the stylist take their time washing your hair, with an amazing scalp massage...they also massage your hands and fingers with lotion! Afterwards she wrapped my hands in hot towels and put one over my eyes. After your haircut they take you to the front where they have a makeup booth set up...they refresh your makeup and then you are on your way. I noted two things on my visits that I also want to make note of. If you are short like me the hair washing station may be uncomfortable for you and or drip water down your back. The other thing is that they really need to choose a better quality coffee to serve as I could hardly choke it down! Other than those two things which are not that important I would recommend this place in a heartbeat.",positive
I switched over here because my hair dresser moved locations. Same great place but a huge bonus is free parking which I enjoy since I got tickets everytime I was parked at the other location.,positive
"I've been going to RedBloom in Bridgeland for about a year now. Until then I had always had trouble finding someone that could deal with my super straight, fine hair. I must admit I was a bit nervous to try them and didn't know what to expect when I first entered the salon and was given a robe to put on. But the experience has always been great! They give you a robe, offer you a drink, give a scalp/shoulder massage at the beginning of the appointment, and everyone is always very pleasant and helpful. I haven't seen anyone other than Christy R., but she's great and I can't say enough good things about her! She always takes a few minutes to sit and chat with me about what I want before she starts doing anything. And I've never gotten as many compliments about my hair as I have since seeing her. I'm going to keep seeing her and would highly recommend both her and the salon to anyone looking for a great hair experience!",positive
"I chose a senior stylist because I wanted to be sure that I would get a 'good cut'. I was super surprised at the low quality of my cut. I was not happy when the stylist could not style my bangs - at all. I had to leave the salon with my bangs sticking straight out from my forehead! As I was paying, there was another client who was leaving with 'party-ready' (It was the Christmas party season) hair - I was not. I had to go home and try and fix my bangs! Overall, the hairstyle had some layering, but the length was left too long providing me with an odd difference between the length and the first layer. A little mullet-like. Also, I felt the stylist was very quick cutting my hair and did not spend enough time on details. (I was there just over 30 mins. for $80) I had also provided a picture of me with my hair how I liked it and I had told the stylist it was important to me to have a 'good cut'. I had to go to two Christmas parties with this shoddy cut. I was pretty disappointed as this was the second time I had been to Redbloom in Bridgeland. The first time was with a junior stylist and again the cut was awful, but I thought that trying a senior stylist would solve the quality of cut problem. I thought I would try Redbloom again because I had mostly read really great reviews on Yelp. This appt. was 8 days before Christmas, so when I brought my disappointing style to RedBloom`s attention, they offered to squeeze me in, in the next week. Unfortunately, I had booked the appt. ahead of time knowing I would be getting busy prior to Christmas - I mean who isn`t? I was not able to make it back before Christmas and ended up cutting some of the length off myself so it was not so mullety. I mean who wants a mullet???",negative
"Colour me impressed (and pardon the pun). I had a great first experience at Redbloom. Right from the start at reception they were professional and friendly. It is a lovely salon without being stuck up and pretentious. It was clean and well maintained compared to many I've been to around 17th ave. They do all the usual stuff of a higher end salon PLUS nice added touches like hand massages. My stylist Jami was a great listener and offered some good ideas on how to tame my lion's mane of hair. And she delivered. I have thicker, wavy hair and in the past have had stylists run screaming but she patiently worked with my hair and gave me awesome highlights and a great cut that made the most of the beast that is my hair. She took her time, in a good way and I am very happy with the results. She helped me choose product that would help be maintain the beast without hard selling. And I found the cost of the cut, highlights AND product all together was cheaper than most other similar salons I've been to in Calgary. Score! While I still need to do the wash-it-and-do-it-myself test, I am confident that Redbloom is worthy of the 5 stars.",positive
I used to get my haircut at Diva downtown Calgary but I followed my hairstylist Nikki to Redbloom in Bridgeland. Nikki is the absolute best She is so warm and kind ...and of course gives the best haircut ever!!!! I recommend this salon as it very nice inside and everyone is attentive.,positive
"Seeing as MeghanH below referenced my experiences in her review, I felt I should put my own two cents out there.!! AWESOME! I am very loyal to a good stylist (or maybe Im too lazy to look for new ones), but I know a great one when I find one. I found one at Redbloom 3-4 years ago now and am still a huge fan. I have been getting my hair cut by Christie R for for ages and even followed her during a hiatious to another salon (thankfully she returned back to this location which is conviently 2 blocks from my house). Christie is so easy to chat with (be it movies, TV, old and new flames or me trying to decide on the color of the week) and does an amazingly consistant cut each and every time. Her colors/highlights also turn out perfect every time I have had to cover the ""arctic grey"". The salon atmosphere itself is FUN, easy going, not pretentious and the staff are extremely friendly and professional. Perks include the hot towels after a shampoo (niiiice after a long work day), hand massages while processing color and a shoulder massage while getting going.! The full experience is quite a treat and doesn't feel like a chore to squeeze in during a busy week. The fact it is an Aveda salon is also a huge draw seeing a Shampure is the best shampoo on the planet and the mens styling products have been a fav of mine for 10 years. At last count I had a partner, a sister, a mother and coworker all going to this location and everyone is a fan...so rest assured - you won't be disappointed. I also just noticed my last cut converting itself to ""hockey hair""..so I need to get an appointment lined up asap.",positive
"Finding a new stylist, or leaving your current stylist, as you know is a very complicated process. It's like breaking up with someone, without all the drunk texting. I enjoyed my previous stylist for the fundamentals but decided to buy a Groupon for Red Bloom based on my brother's experiences with it. There is plenty of parking around the Bridgeland shopping area, so you'll have no trouble there. RedBloom uses AVEDA products and the AVEDA techniques for styling and colouring. You are in for an absolute treat. Upon entering, a nice receiptionist always welcomes you and offers to take your coat. You change into a nice little robe and are always offered a drink. (Not sure if they serve alcoholic drinks or not) The waiting area is always nice and clean and you usually aren't waiting there for too long. I have been seeing Ashley, an intermediate stylist for about a year now. She is a sweet girl with great talent. RedBloom charges by the type of stylist: student, intermediate, advanced and Master. But I imagine anyone you get will be amazing given the way Aveda teaches their students. While your colour processes, the stylist provides hand massages using Aveda hand cream. So awesome. I feel Ashley always spends a lot of time styling my hair, and ensuring all roots are thoroughly covered. There have been a couple of times when I have requested something that has taken longer than my appointment allowed and Ashley was great to accommodate. There was even a time when we stayed past closing! When you are all done, they always offer to touch up your make up with some lip gloss and translucent powder. What is better than that for a night out? Nudding! The price is just below other high end salons I would say. I pay about 170$ for colour and cut. Maybe even less than that. I highly recommend this salon for men and for women. I've even recommended my mom! It's a family affair down at RedBloom Bridgeland. Which reminds me, I have to make an appointment, the tall men in my office are commenting on my gray hair again :S p.s. One time when getting my hair done, I saw a stylist shaving skull and crossbones into a young boy's head. It was probably the coolest cut I have ever seen on a child. Even for kids' cuts they are the coolest.",positive
"I've been to both of the Red Bloom Salons and I have been happy with both. I am busy and my schedule is erratic and it is difficult for me to make appointments too far in advance. I usually just call on the day that I have time and find out if there is any stylist open. The folks who answer the phone are helpful and if I can't get in with the stylist I have used in the past - they will make a suggestion. I usually know what I want done when I go it, but the odd time I will ask for a suggestion. The stylists are helpful and friendly - I get the feeling that they like where they work and it makes a huge difference in their service. The details are what make this salon my favourite: a head and shoulder massage before they start, and the offer of a hot towel at the end. Not one who usually likes being pampered - it is pretty hard to resist, and I am always happy I accepted when its done.",positive
"I've been going to RedBloom ever since I moved to Calgary a couple years ago and into the Bridgeland area. I've always had great service from reception to the stylists I've seen there. Only once have I had an issue and it was corrected on my next visit(saw a different stylist). I've always seen a senior stylist there each one I've seen I've appreciated the time they've taken to do a proper consultation plus each time I go in, another quick consultation to check in and see if I'm happy with my previous cut and if there is anything different that should be done or changed. I look forward to my next visit there. 7/30",positive
"I came home for Christmas and was in desperate need of a haircut for the holidays. I couldn't wait to get to my usual guy in Vancouver so I asked for some recommendations and heard that Billie at Redbloom was great. Billie was more than great - she's FANTASTIC! I always get a bob, which happens to be her favorite. Each time I get my hair cut I try to explain that I want the back shorter with lots of shape and volume. This was the first time I was told by a stylist there were two ways she could to the cut: one would keep more length (a request I have for growing my hair for my wedding) and one that would add a ton of volume to my fine hair but would be a bit shorter. I opted for the latter and it is AMAZING! It's what I always wanted but never articulated. I loved that Billie took the time to listen and gave me options. I love her passion for bobs! Plus she is super sweet and I got to eat a delicious cookie that she baked!",positive
"Stylish, modern and vibrant, an expensive treat for a bad hair day. Ultimately I go to Red Bloom for two reasons, my stylist (Brandy) and the environmentally friendly, high performance products of Aveda. Red Bloom is always aware of the latest and greatest trends and when you like to change your hair colour as often as I do, that's a great thing. Recommend a friend and receive $10.00 off of your next hair cut. A high-end salon that can guarantee perfect results at a cost.",positive
"Best eyebrow threading I've ever had! Tatianna takes her time and keeps my eyebrows perfect every single time. I am very picky and have had my eyebrows done for many years, she is the best!",positive
"Great haircut in CU. It's a bit pricey and they do take some time to get to you, but I think it's worth it. Other places in CU don't seem to take their time on your hair the same way Rkooa does. If you aren't sure on how you want your hair cut, they ask for details and help you work through it. They do ask that you download an app called Mahu and save your spot in line, but this makes sense since you don't want to be waiting at the shop for hours. They let you know when they're ready for you through the app! Everyone working there is really friendly too. I heard really good things about eyebrow threading as well!",positive
"Ladies, ask for Tatiana to get your eyebrows threaded! She is amazing!! Super nice & amazing at her job! I was nervous coming down to U of I trying to find a new eyebrow lady, but now I don't want my eyebrows done anywhere else! Be patient though. Perfection takes time, and Tatiana never disappoints!",positive
"Dennis is one of my go-to barbers for my fade. He makes sure to do it exactly as I ask and will let me look at different top lengths, and their scheduling app let's you come in without waiting",positive
"Please, do not frequent this establishment for a haircut. Notice that the only two reviews are for eyebrow threading. Let me give you a ""feel"" for this place. - The barbers are all African and frankly, they are a bit brusque and pushy. They had the Television on high the whole time and one of these guys just sat and stared at the TV the entire time. My barber would pause to watch the television while cutting my hair....and I mean pause 5-15 seconds. - They force everyone to sign into this stupid electronic system instead of just making people wait and it is a mess. If you do not have a smartphone or just don't feel like giving them your information, they make you feel uncomfortable. - They do not have the prices posted. Yes, this is getting to be like Africa.... My barber charged me 22$ for a haircut that he messed up on. I came back, and talked to Tatianna...I guess... and asked ""how much does a haircut cost here?"" I wanted to check the price prior to asking for a fix. She told me ""oh, it depends...you know, depends on the barber, what he feels like, what you work out with him?"" So, I ask her what the heck is going on here, what is the limit. She says ""oh, between 16 and 23 dollars."" My barber never asked me a thing, he just charged me the money. - The clientele is either African American, or people looking to get David Beckham style haircuts. They all probably love using their app so sign in to the waiting list, don't mind that their barber is watching a TV show while cutting their hair, and will continue to come back and waste over 20$ at a time. Definitely not a traditional, professional, high quality barber shop. - Of, and of course, no shaving your neck for 20$, no hairwash, not even putting down some aftershave lotion on the neck. Let me also add that my barber mad-handled my head, didn't say a word the whole time, and was basically surly. If you want to waste your money, experience some shady business, and maybe get a David Beckham cut, come to these guys....if you want a traditional cut, or even something affordable, go elsewhere.",negative
"This is where you go for a proper fade from a real barber. The guy has been cutting hair in Champaign for 10+ years so you can't go wrong. I wanted a traditional tapered fade and couldn't find that in Champaign but Ray took care of it. You can pay with a credit card also so that was convenient. The best way is to make an appointment and the best way to do that is to download their free app called Mehu. Its all self explanatory after that, but you'll be able to make the appt and then it will give you updates as your time slot approaches via the app also. Be sure to select Ray. What you see is pretty much what you get, you won't be dissapointed. I've included the links for the app below and also some pictures so you get an idea.

"I too, left several messages without a return call. I'm new to the area and met someone who is friend of Amy so I thought I would try this salon out. But after reading reviews on several sights, I'm glad I didn't go. I ended up going to Living Art and was extremely happy.....what a difference in professionalism.",negative
been twice to Amy and she really listens to what you want. I feel like I am not rushed and she isn't wanting to get me out of there. I texted her with follow up questions when I panicked it was too dark and she immediately got back to me and wanted to make sure I was happy. It's not super fancy salon but definitely relaxing and enjoyable.,positive
"Don't bother calling. They don't need any new business. I left a message first thing yesterday morning and it's 2 PM the next day and no one has called me. I could go on with what a terrible, terrible idea it is to have new clients call and leave a message for a particular stylist when their social media all the highlights one person in particular, so I don't know who else works there. But at least call me back and let me know that you are busy, so I can make an appointment elsewhere, if I did happen to ask for the stylist with the most clients since that was the only name I knew.",negative
"Loved my stylist, Amy! She really listened and asked questions to see exactly what I wanted for my hair. I definitely will be back!!",positive
"Want a disaster? Head on in! Amy should start by heading back to school...or perhaps hanging up her clippers. For a janky strip mall experience with shoddy expertise and uptown pricing, head to Salon 160.",negative
Tiffany did a great job with my hair! She made perfect recommendations and did quality coloring. I highly recommend this salon.,positive
"I've been going to Delores for almost four years - I don't trust anyone else with my hair! Not only is she funny and personable... she is an actual hair wizard! I'm someone who likes to change up my hair pretty much every season. Delores always nails the look I'm trying to achieve, and does so in a way that keeps my hair looking and feeling healthy! Another huge benefit of seeing Delores is the super easy booking process. You can book with her on styleseat.com, find dates/times that work for you and set up your card to make the payment/tip process seamless. Her rates are extremely affordable, especially considering the quality of her work. The salon is spacious, clean and full of great products. I can't say enough great things about Delores and Salon Lulu!",positive
"I have been a stylist at Salon Lulu for some time, and if you're a stylist looking for a home, look no further! Linda is amazing, kind and hard-working. We love her! The salon is clean and professional, you'd love it here. If you're someone looking for a new stylist, each stylist works individually scheduling their own appointments and can be found at the website luluhairsalon.com. Each stylist has their specialties and if you're looking for something specific just call and ask, we're happy to refer you to the best fit. I am a balayage/ cut / curly hair stylist and have included a few pictures of my work for you to check out. If you like, you can book appointments with me directly by texting 845.444.0963 or visit styleseat.com/deloresturnbow to view my schedule and pricing online. My Instagram @ddelorable for more pictures of my work Thanks for reading!",positive
"ASK FOR Delores! I wanted a red blend and needed a hair cut that let my hair grow out naturally and be low maintenance, so looked for a hair stylist for months! Found her and she did not disappoint ! Worth every penny and it still looks gorgeous!",positive
"I gave 1 star only because it wouldn't let me do no stars. This was a very bad experience for me! I was at the salon for 5 hours, and it cost me $192.00 for a color. Christine Davis was the stylist. I came in with a picture of what I wanted. When she was done my hair looked hideous. I was devastated. I called Christine the next day to find out what we could do. She was rude, and mean. I was depressed and couldn't leave my house for days. I have never written a review before, but I feel the need to try and help someone else from this experience.",negative
I found this on Yelp when driving through AZ. THey are the best and now I drive 10 hours to go to LULUs to get my hair hilighted!! They are def worth it!!,positive
"SHOUTOUT TO INDIA! WOOT WOOT! By far best experience, so professional, very high class. Cozy chairs and great comolimentery drinks. Great experience! Will definitely go back, she did bleach to evening out my fine straight brown hair and gave me tips that would fit within my budget. Thanks a million, definitely going back and very affordable too!=) Thanks Lulu!",positive
My family and I recently moved to Tempe from San Diego and I was needing a cut bad! I saw reviews for Jessica then looked up her Instagram and saw more of her work and really liked what I saw. I booked an appointment with her and yesterday she cut/highlighted my hair and I LOVE it! She checked often about the length I wanted and did a perfect blend between the 2 photos I showed her. She also is so kind and easy to talk to! I'm glad I found someone quickly to do my hair who is so professional and super sweet. Thanks Jessica!,positive
"I see Jessica here and she just does an absolutely amazing job on my hair. She's very responsive to requests and meticulous in her work. I've been seeing her for over a year now and I get constant compliments from friends and strangers on my hair. Definitely A+. The salon itself, just a heads up, doesn't seem to staff a receptionist? So all scheduling etc is done by the individual stylists. So just be aware when you come in and you don't immediately have someone there to greet you/man the phones etc.",positive
"Jessica McClean is a very talented hairstylist, knows what she is doing! I have been her client for 2 years now,she makes you feel relaxed and comfortable while getting your hair highlighted & cut. She uses great products, very up to date on current styles & trends. I am very happy with my hair, love the results every time! She is fantastic!!! Salon LuLu provides a relaxing environment,easy to find, plenty of parking. I highly recommend Jessica!",positive
"I discovered this salon about a year ago so decided to give it a try. Erin, the owner, is absolutely amazing. She listens to what I want, gives me suggestions, and in the end I love the results. I would recommend Erin to all my family and friends.",positive
"Cute, small, trendy salon. Clean with friendly staff. Jessica was awesome, trimming my hair exactly as I asked- we were totally on the same wavelength. I appreciate places that rent chairs to their stylists so they are paid what they are worth, and this place does it. No high pressure product sales.",positive
So happy to have found this salon with my favorite hair stylist Christine. I always can trust her with a great cuts and perfect color. Whether it's highlights low light or some combination the color always comes out just right. She also uses very high quality products so my hair feels fantastic. And suggests other products I can use at home to keep it that way. So the results my hair always looks healthy and fantastic!,positive
"First impressions are everything... I just walked in to see if they had walk-in availability. One staff member looked at me then looked right back at their phone and didn't say a word. Finally, someone greeted me. Mind you there was about 10 feet between me and that person. I then asked if they could squeeze me in for a trim and the one stylist that was asked responded that ""she had an appointment in 30 mins"" I had to reply and say ok so does that mean you don't have time?? It's like no one knows how to talk there... Either they are all too busy or they just don't know what customer service means, or both. They could have just earned a new client. Oh well...",negative
I love this salon! It's clean and relaxing. Jasmine is the best! She is full of energy and always makes my hair feel fabulous! She takes her time and makes sure I am completely happy before I leave. Jasmine is someone I would recommend to anyone who is looking for a stylist who is passionate about their work. She is honest and walks you through the process so you are aware of the stages and what's going on. She is so knowledgable and gives feedback on how to improve your hair and look your best! She is truly the BEST and she will be stuck with me and my hair forever!,positive
"The salon is decent not great, I was a walk in appointment and felt rushed out. There was color from the dye stained on my face ears and neck when I left because she didn't wipe it off while it was wet. She also didn't show me a sample of the dyed hair while I was picking a color, so that I could make sure it was what I wanted like salons normally do. I showed her a picture and she chose the color, which didn't turn out the same color or even close to it. I won't be going back.",negative
I love coming here! Lorraine has been doing my hair since September and I'm always pleased with the results. I came to her based on a referral when I was looking to change stylists. Lorraine knows what she's doing and strives to give you what you want. She's a sweetheart and lots of fun to talk to.,positive
I have been going to Salon Lulu since it opened. I absolutely love how clean it is and all the independent employees are super sweet and professional. I would recommend this salon to everyone. Jasmine has been doing my hair for years and she does a great job. I would recommend Erin also who is super sweet and does a great job doing hair.,positive
"Lorraine has been styling my hair for the last 6 years. I have literally followed her to multiple locations. I did try to find someone else closer to my side of town to color and cut my hair but I never left feeling like a movie star. So I went back to lorraine and decided it was worth the drive since I trust her with my life when it comes to my hair. She understands my hair like no else and makes sure she understands what I want done before she proceeds. If she ever has to cut more than 1 or 2 inches when you are asking for a trim, she will first let you know what is going on with your hair for her to suggest cutting more than necessary and then asks you if it is ok. She NEVER cuts off your hair without your consent. She is a wonderful stylist and everyone always asks who does my hair. I literally get compliments on my hair every day. I have red hair and an A line Bob. If you want to leave the salon feeling like a celebrity ask for Lorraine. She is the best!",positive
"I love this place! The first thing to note, is each chair is rented to different stylists so it's not a corporate set up like Ulta or other salons in the valley- it's like mini businesses within a business so pricing completely depends on who you are seeing. I have been going to DeDra for 5 or so years now and she is absolutely amazing. I get compliments on my hair almost on a daily basis; she really understands color, flattering cuts, and can explain why something may or may not work because of your hair type or texture, etc. Being that I have followed this one amazing stylist all over the Chandler area through the years, I feel like I have a pretty good idea of what salons have it, and which are lacking. Salon Lulu is super clean, updated and by no means has that gaudy decor that seems to be a running a muck (gotta love those places that have giant gold painted cherubs on the walls with fake ivy plants or massive chandeliers made of pink and black plastic beads so you feel like you're somewhere ""classy""). It's got a great vibe from the diverse group of stylists that are there and there is a fantastic lack of caddy and petty women. Everyone is super nice and helpful from my experiences and everyone seems to jive well together. I dig it!",positive
"I love Erin as a stylist, she has been doing my hair now for several years. She has always been very professional and courteous. I would follow her, wherever she sets up shop in the metro area. Just got my hair done today, and as always perfect cut and color. Love her!!!",positive
Beautiful updated salon. Comfortable atmosphere. Well trained stylists. I would trust anyone at Salon Lulu with my hair. They also have a nail tech and an esthetician.,positive
"They should rename this place Salon Lu-ser. I went in to have my bangs and ends trimmed. Unfortunately for me, I left with an uneven chop shop looking mess and six inches in length cut off. Between the abysmal stylist Lorraine and the argumentative salon manager Erin, I'm not sure what was more disappointing. I wanted a refund for several reasons; I hate my hair, I asked for a trim and left with lopsided bob and they wanted me to wait nearly two days to have it fixed. Not to mention, the one doing the fixing was supposed to be the stylist who whacked my hair off in the first place. No thank you Lorraine. No client should have to wait two days to have hair their fixed especially considering I paid Lorraine $36.00 for a haircut and I left looking like a mess. The salon manager Erin stated she would not be giving me a refund because she 'can't' and the stylist Lorraine states she can't give a refund because it's 'store policy'. Someone is lying. To quote the salon webpage directly, ""Come experience Salon Lulu; we guarantee you'll be satisfied with your appearance"". I was utterly dissatisfied with the appearance of my haircut"". Their complete lack of customer service skills is a direct reflection of poor business practices. NEVER AGAIN",negative
"Jade is an excellent haircutter. Knows lots about world politics and will talk your ear off about it if you let her (LOL) but also has a sensitive touch. She's a great listener. And knows when to hold them and knows when to fold them. She does a perfect Updo if your ever in a pinch, and could color the Sasquatch camouflage (if you know what I mean) and basically, what I mean, is she's the total package. She does it all. Great cuts, great colors, great times....great Scott! Go see Jade.",positive
"I had my hair styled at Salon Mila twice in the past four months by Jennifer, and was very happy with it. In fact it was the best haircut I have had in several years. My only complaint was that the owner was a little overly assertive in recommending other services I was not interested in. This made the visit uncomfortable and in my opinion was out of line.",negative
"Amazing service! Most of the staff and the owner are always friendly and remember me, they're pretty talkative, not really my thing, but I can deal with it. Only exception is one of the older receptionist girls always seems to be in a foul mood, esp towards me. I use my time there to relax. I get a Shampoo and Style for around $55, the price has been changed on me 4x, 1 high, lowered, 1 higher, 1 higher again. Always around $50 - $65 at one point I believe. I'm told my hair is very easy to work with and it takes about 45min but the receptionist insists on charging me more than the average quote. I've always gotten a brow wax here, was very good, good shaping and didn't hurt. They're got some nice products and a great boutique, it's for older women with a lot of time and money to spend, their sizes are also slightly above average, a bit larger, the shoes are for small feet... I find it ridiculous over priced but ::NELLY:: is the best stylist ever! She can work with short, long, damaged, healthy, curly, wavy, straight... Black, White, Hispanic, Asian...whatever hair! She's very helpful with you maintaining your own hair and suggesting services or products that actually with work for you! She does amazing color and cutting as well. She's a very creative stylists with a lot of techniques (hair, nails, brow) under her belt, throw anything at her for wedding, prom, date night - she loves it! * * * Nelly no longer works here, think there was price increases/pay uses. * * *",positive
"A familiar story...my hair stylist moved; I needed to find another...went for cut and color. The color turned out close to what I wanted, the cut was incomplete, and out of proportion. I waited a few days to see if it would settle in; it didn't. Ready to try to cut it myself, and with a window of 2 hours, I searched again. Salon Mila came up! (Wishing it had come up sooner!!) I called, and Lillian had time for me, right then! That often doesn't happen, with someone good, but then, I was hopeful they don't overbook, so I could get a future appt. Lillian and I had a great discussion of what to do, very candid, and she didn't start until we were clear on the outcome, as the cut I had left her not much to work with. This is an Aveda Salon, another huge plus. Lillian cut my hair with precision, checking carefully all over for symmetry, and working to preserve length as well as give shape. She achieved the definition and movement in my hair that I wanted, and the cut complements my bone structure. I have gotten so many compliments, everywhere I go!! That has not happened in several years!! And, it's a couple of weeks since the cut, and it has washed and dried, and started to grow out, keeping the shape and movement, without fuss. I am SO HAPPY! You will love this salon, you will love Lillian, if you are looking for precision cutting and styling that is easy and carefree, and products that are healthy and beneficial. Going for color with her next time! Bottom line, I feel like 'myself', like I look the way I see myself, not a standard Scottsdale or trendy haircut. Lillian, please don't leave!!!!",positive
"My friend and I came here for her 50th birthday to get our hair and make up done and we couldn't have been more thrilled with the results! Marlene and Kasey were absolutely brilliant and they worked wonders with our hair. We told them what we were looking to have any they did it better than we could have even imagined. Unfortunately, I'm not from Scottsdale but if I was, these girls would be my preferred stylists! Thank you so much, Kasey and Marlene!",positive
I have been going to Salon Mila for 12 years. I will never go anywhere else. My hair always looks amazing when I leave. The color and cut are always perfect! I feel glamorous and beautiful when I leave. First class salon! Beautiful surroundings! Always great service! They aim to please! Mila knows what it takes to make sure her customers feel welcome all the time! Thanks everyone!,positive
"Extremely overpriced for the services.....I've had much better colors and cuts at Rolf's at Gainey Village in Scottsdale, which is a MUCH higher end salon with more contemporary, educated stylists, for less $$. Of course, you're going to pay more because this salon is associated with The Boulders but the quality of the services and the overall condition of the salon are kind of borderline old.",negative
"If you color your hair I highly recommend seeing Marci at Salon Mila. I was in AZ on a business trip and stopped in the Golden Door Spa to have my hair Colored and cut. Marci did an amazing job. My hair was over processed and too blond from highlighting for too many years. In just a short time so was able to add low lights, brighten my highlights and turn my hair back to it's normal natural state... I LOVE IT. Every time I stop by thru Phoenix I'll be in to see Marci (not to mention I live in NYC where the best salons usually are). Don't wait...go see her!",positive
"I have been looking for a nice place to have my nails done in Downtown Pgh for a long time. Finally, I've found it. Nina (who is warm, friendly and personable) fit me in at the last minute and had my old gel polish off and full manicure done in 45 minutes. And my nails look beautiful - probably the best manicure I've ever had. I almost never review anything, but this place is worth it.",positive
"Went to the salon since its close to where I work. Also wanted to see how the quality of work was. It. Was. Great....! Had a basic manicure with Nina. She was efficient, knowledgable, kind, conversive and welcoming. I will definitely be back soon!",positive
i must thank Carol and the staff at Salon Nuvo for taking care of me with my broken nail emergency during my stay at a hotel on the north shore! I really appreciate how they accommodated me!,positive
"I've always had haircuts that were just ""well, good enough; it's not a disaster."" Then I went into Salon Nuvo on a whim and had Marjorie cut my hair. You could tell that she knew what she was doing and had good command of different cutting and layering techniques, making my hair look excellent. Best haircut ever. For once I came out of a salon really loving my hair and the way that it looked. She even recommend a hair product which doesn't make my hair shiny but still has a firm hold. Definitely coming back. Couldn't recommend Marjorie more!",positive
"When I was back visiting Pittsburgh, I decided I wanted to get my hair done at the salon I loved when I lived there. Well, my normal girl, Autumn was not available, no big deal, they hooked me up with Megan. She was awesome! Really listened to what I wanted done-which was just a maintenance cut, little off the ends, and fix my layers since I wanted to keep my length. Conversation was free flowing and never once felt forced. She paid attention to what I said I was doing that night (going out to dinner for my anniversary) and asked if she could style my hair for the night. I was excited she offered and even more excited with the final results. I have very tick, long, wavy hair and Megan was not afraid to have fun with it, even if it took longer than some other clients may. I'm glad I was able to get while I was in town. Thanks again! :)",positive
"Do you ever have those moments when, if you don't get your hair cut THAT DAY you're going to lose your mind? For someone who gets a haircut about twice per year, those moments happen about once every six months; one of which was last week. In that moment, any loyalty I had to my regular Shadyside salon went out the window in favor on instant gratification downtown. After asking around the office and checking Yelp reviews, balanced against who was available within the hour, I ended up with Meg at Salon Nuvo. From start to finish neither of ever shut up - in a good way. She took her time and after the last bang was trimmed, I was feeling pretty satisfied. My only concern was over the length of one of the layers and my bangs. Meg advised me to live with it through the weekend and come back for any necessary touch-ups, which I did today. I basically told her, ""I'm not sure how to explain what I want, so let's just do something else."" She did. I liked it. I'm happy. I'll be back.",positive
Really nice and friendly people! Also good prices. We got pedicures and there was a big variety of colors to choose from. The Saran Wrap they wrap your toes in after was weird and uncomfortable and they could probably get nicer pedicure chairs but I'd come back!!,positive
The salon is so dirty we left before I let them cut me hair. The sanitizers were old and half full. The scissors and combs were a mess. http://www.wellbuzz.com/dr-oz-beauty/dr-oz-pedicure-bacterial-infections-dry-pedicure-haircut-ringworm/,negative
"I traveled to Pittsburgh for a wedding and needed someone to do my hair and makeup. I was originally looking for someone that would travel to my hotel but I stumbled on this salon and saw all the great reviews. The salon ended up being a block from the Renaissance Hotel so I went ahead and booked an appointment. I saw all the great reviews for Autumn so I tried booking her for a haircut, updo, and makeup. Unfortunately she was booked so I settled for hair and makeup. I went straight to the salon from the airport and arrived about 15 minutes late. Autumn seemed a little stand offish at first but she quickly warmed up. She went ahead and offered to do all three services for me, even though we both knew that meant she would have to stay late. She asked me for pictures of what I was looking for and executed them perfectly. I really liked that we chatted the whole time but she never stopped working. She was extremely efficient. The hairstyle was elegant and trendy at the same time. The haircut fixed my bangs that were growing out funnily. The makeup was enought that it was noticeable, but didn't make me look like a drag queen. She did use some drugstore brands which made me a little nervous at first but for $27 she made me look amazing. The makeup stayed on all night. I have had my hair and makeup done by MarioDedivanovic's assistant (Kim Kardashian's make up artist) and I was more pleased by Autumn's work.",positive
I went there for Brazilian blowout . After spending around 400 bucks including tip my hair have not changed at all . They look even worse . They re-did it again to try to fix them but nothing happened. I have no complains about my stylist. She was very nice to me and looking in details but their procedure and product did not work . When I showed them results after second time after a wash they juts said thanks for stopping by. I wasted my money :(,negative
"I've been going to this salon on and off for 10 years. While I was going to Salon Nuvo I had long, thick, wavy hair with short bangs. My whole life I've had issues with finding the right stylist because I have a ridiculous amount of hair. I found Autumn through reviews for people with curly hair and they were right..Autumn is seriously gifted at cutting curly/thick hair. In the time I went to Autumn I got constant compliments on my hair. My long, out of control hair was finally in control. I didn't even have to blow dry with the cuts she gave me, she managed to work with my natural hair type to make it lay perfectly. I can't say enough about how awesome she is. Unfortunately it is really difficult for me to get Downtown which is the only negative thing about this salon..I had to switch to a salon near my house and no matter how much I pay noone can even compare to Autumn. Hopefully after reading this review a few people will get to experience Autumn's awesomeness since I can't anymore :(.",positive
"I have been going to Salon Nuvo for about two years now. Autumn does my hair and she is amazing. I have very fine, thinning hair and the cut is always flattering. And Autumn seems quite supportive of my desire to not color my very grey hair, which is something I have not had in other salons ... there has always been a push to do some sort of coloring treatment.",positive
Salon Nuvo has a wonderful and comfortable atmosphere. The staff is very friendly and professional. Terry Boden has been doing my hair for 7 years and she is AMAZING!! She has never failed to give me what I asked for. I always leave the chair 100% happy with the style and service that I was given. She keeps my hair healthy and beautiful; I get compliments on it all the time!,positive
"I started getting my bitten nails done here. the nail lady, Carol, does a fantastic job. Started with tips and now I have my own nails. I was shocked that my nails did not get destroyed under this tips, which has happened anywhere else I have gone. There is only one nail person, so you have to come while she is there, but I have never had any problem getting appointments. She has even stayed late on occasion to get me in.",positive
"Everyone at Salon Nuvo is a professional. Everyone is friendly and it's a really great salon. Chrissy has done my hair for almost 15 years (she moved to Salon Nuvo about 2 years ago) and I trust no one else to perm or color my hair. Chrissy understands chemicals and how to maintain healthy hair. She's a dedicated professional and has always been flexible - she let's me come in late to accommodate my work/school schedule. And everyone I've ever referred to her has been a happy customer :-) I'm pretty brutal on my hair (lots of heat and don't deep condition as often as I should, in addition to a fair amount of every day stresses)....If Chrissy didn't maintain and take care of my hair, I'd probably be bald by now! She keeps it trimmed, healthy, and growing!!! And she's super sweet....it's a delight to sit in her chair :-)",positive
I have been getting my hair done by Terry Boden for a looonnnggg time and she is one of the 3 people I have let cut my hair in my entire life!! I even take my four year old daughter to her when I can and she is amazing with her!!! I am very picky about my hair but put all my trust in her and am I glad I did!!! The salon is nice and the other ladies are all professional. I grew up in Pittsburgh and moved due to the military but everytime I am in town to visit I find Terry so she can work her magic on my hair. She really is a jack of all trades and I LOVE what she does for me!! I recommend anyone to give her a try....no matter what hair type!! You wont be dissapointed!!,positive
"The highest praise that I can give SALON NUVO - and very specifically, Terry, the stylist who does my braids on a regular basis - is that I am constantly stopped by strangers who like my hair and want to know who works on it. Whenever I've gotten my hair re-braided, her handiwork usually gets complimented within minutes of me exiting the building. My friends and family remain fascinated by the new patterns she twists my hair into...and I'm a guy, so I like the attention! ;^) Terry typically twists my hair initially, then finishes them off as three-part braids, so that they will hold longer. I personally like this look, because it appears more ""full"", and yet still has some life to it.. She's so good, no one ever guesses that I'm gradually thinning on top, and versatile enough that we've switched this look up from time to time. In professional settings, my hair is always stylish enough to merit compliments, never so ""busy"" that people do double-takes. Terry is really phenomenal. I can't boast enough about her! Her coworker Chris was previously my stylist for many years, and even though she no longer does my hair (braiding is Terry's province), I would recommend her in a heartbeat. These two stylists are experts with all textures of hair, and I've recommended them both for years and continue to do so. So, if you think you can handle getting compliments as soon as you leave the hair salon, go to SALON NUVO and ask for Terry (or Chris). You'll definitely get more than your money's worth and schedule a return appointment!",positive
"I have curly hair. Big curls, not tight ones, but definitely ringlets that can become Shirley Temple hair if I let it. It's always very difficult to find a hair stylist. Even as a child I seemed to go from one bad cut to another, by one poorly trained (in non-kinky curly hair) stylist or another. For the past 12 years or so I had resigned to cutting my own hair: at least I could look bad for free. Then someone with curly hair recommended I see Autumn at Salon Nuvo, and I've been beautifully coiffed ever since. She listens as I explain three hairstyles at once that I want bits and pieces of but don't really know what I can pull off, and the end result always somehow makes sense and looks fantastic. She also styled my sister (wavy hair), best friend (long straight hair), and my hair and makeup for my wedding and let me tell you, we were babes. In fact, some friends of mine looked dashing that night as well and it turns out they also went to her for their stylings. Autumn is an artist who can really see the best of your features and works your hair to make it frame your face perfectly. And, as mentioned, if there is something that you don't think is quite right, she's always willing to make adjustments after-the-fact, which takes a lot of stress out of the fear of post-hair-change regret. The Salon is professional, well-rounded, friendly, and afforable.",positive
"Nice people & nice location. Very experienced, which means they can make good recommendations. I felt I was in good hands. Location is very pleasant. The shop is clean, well-kept and feels upscale. Definitely going back, and encourage you to try it out!",positive
"I have gotten four haircuts from Autumn so far and they are the best that I have had in Pittsburgh -- and, I think, anywhere! I cannot recommend her highly enough. She is pleasant and easy to talk to and gives fantastic and cool haircuts. Also: her prices are very reasonable. I also have it on good authority that she gives great men's haircuts as well.",positive
I called for an appointment and had my haircut with Lilly. She was able to cut my hair dry and gave me a beautiful layered look. The price is unbeatable as well!,positive
"Got my hair cut with highlights and low lights by Van. She is amazing. She juggles multiple clients at the same time. She's funny and entertaining while being amazingly talented. It was my first visit and I went based on reviews from Yelp. I've already scheduled my next appointment and can't wait to go back. I'll be bringing my entire family. She's extremely busy, so make sure you make an appointment. Even if there's a wait, it is well worth it. Highly recommend.",positive
"I am so pleased with the service at Sassy Salon. Not only is Van a great hairstylist, she is a lovely person. I went for a hair treatment that didn't work in my hair and when I told Van, she asked me to come in so she can look at my hair. She did the treatment again and carried on a conversation with me while she did it. She was super sweet and insisted I didn't pay. I will remain a loyal client.",positive
"LOVE LOVE LOVE meemee!! She's awesome! Although I've only been to her a few times, she's never messed up my hair! She's friendly, funny and definitely knows what she's doing! The price for a haircut is a little steep, but totally worth it! :)",positive
Ok so Lilly is amazing! She just fixed a bad haircut that i got somewhere else!! She knew exactly what i wanted and needed! My hair feels soft and looks great! Can't say enough good things about my experience here.,positive
The stylist was very nice. She listened to what I wanted. When I left the salon my hair was styled with curls in the cutest way it has ever been styled by a salon. The next morning when I straightened my hair like usual I saw all the flaws. I asked for an inverted bob and there was no definition of invert in my hair. My hair was just cut straight. I asked for layers in the back and my layers look horrible! I am so depress with my hair I have just been tying it up. I feel like she messed up my hair so she styled it the way she did so I wouldn't see her mistake. If you are looking for a high end salon this is not the place to go to unless you just want a simple straight haircut. They wouldn't be able to do an inverted bob for you.,negative
I am very happy that I finally found a salon I love. Lilly is very awesome and she's always willing to do your vision and will tell you that it's possible and give you suggestions as well. She did the best ombré I could ask for that I constantly get complimented for. People even ask me where I get my hair done and I always send them to Lilly. I have loved having her as my hair dresser as I feel like I can send her anything and she can do it. Love this place.,positive
"I have to start this review off by saying that I've been coming to sassy salon for, wow, two years now. MeeMee is my hair stylist and by far the best one I've ever had. (No exaggerations) Two years ago I had just moved to Charlotte and knew nothing about the area, I just knew I was in a desperate need of a hair cut. I am extremely picky about who cuts my hair, because frankly I'm a picky person and I always have something to complain about. I looked all over midtown, most places I needed an appointment, they were booked, or wanted to charge me $70+ for JUST the hair cut (no wash or style included). So i looked in the south park area and the same thing. Since I was new to Charlotte I didn't realize these were more of the expensive areas but when I googled hair salons they came up... I had given and went back home. Googled salons near me and Sassy Salon came up, I thought the name was cute but wasn't sold until I saw the reviews. MeeMee had the most pleasant reviews (and Van, the owner but they said she was almost always booked). I walked in and asked for MeeMee and was able to get my hair cut on the spot. I explained to her exactly how I wanted it and everything that had ever went wrong of course. I couldn't have been more pleased. I tell absolutely EVEYONE who compliments my hair to go to her. She recently dyed my hair (my first time ever) it was stunning. And six months later my color is still as amazing as ever. I get constant compliments on my hair and I always, always, always recommend her. The best part about it, I always look as if I've received a $100+ hair cut and style but the whole process of wash, cut and style only costs me $30 (plus tip, AWAYS TIP HAIR STYLISTS!!). That's right--$30!. Don't let the fact that Sassy Salon is on independence. The salon is always super clean, extremely modern and could fit in with the best in south park and midtown. It's worth the drive. Worth the money. Worth everything. I promise you will leave feeling amazing and be highly satisfied. After two years I continue to go, and this will forever be my salon.",positive
Meemee is amazing! The only hair stylist that has truly gotten my hair right. She completely understands how to work with Asian hair. She dyed my hair to a brown color and it looks so natural and beautiful. I highly recommend her :-),positive
"I have been going to Sassy Salon ever since they first opened. Van, is the owner of this salon and she always does great color on my hair. She knows how to color Asian hair very well. She is great and never puts pressure on her customers to buy hair product. Even when I haven't showed up for awhile, she still treats me like a customer. She is very knowlegeable on coloring and highligting hairs. I just went to get my hair color last Sat, and Van did a great job on my hair. I had color and highlights done on my hair. I am very pleased with the results as always. There is another stylist there called MeeMee and she also does great job on haircuts. I would strongly recommend Van or MeeMee to do your hair. The price is reasonable here. I love the scalp message there. With color and highlights it costed me 110 and if this is done at the Ballantyne salon it would cost be double this price.",positive
"Never before have I walked out of a hair cut and felt so good. My stylist, MeeMee really took her time to listen to exactly what I wanted and gave me a cut that made me feel like a whole new person. She also waxed my eyebrows. I'm very, very particular about how they are done, and she got it right the very first time! I have (finally) found the salon that I will go back to and become a regular client. Two thumbs way, way up!",positive
"I love sassy salon! It's very reasonably priced and they have amazing stylist. They are so gentle with my hair, it feels like I'm getting a scalp massage ! I will definitely be back!",positive
"Good Location, Great Deal, Awesome Service Amazing Stylist! I'm extremely picky with my hair dressers, I've used the same girl for years, and having recently moved to Charlotte from New Orleans- I was on a mission. After my scheduled appointment with another salon was cancelled, I decided to call Sassy Salon based on the great Yelp reviews. I was not disappointed! Van was very sweet and was able to take me right way. The salon was nice, clean, and the girls really makes you feel at home. I really had fun chatting with Van and Mimi! Though I just came in for a trim, Van consulted with me on what I wanted, and cut/styled my hair to blend well with my existing ombré. Very skilled artist in her craft! Rates are affordable and location is easy to get to from Uptown! I plan on returning to Sassy Salon for my next appointment!!! Thanks Ladies!!",positive
"Make sure you go to Mimi(I think that's her name?) for the hair-cut. I went last week and Mimi was busy so I had another girl cut my hair and it was nice for 15 minutes until I came home and had a closer look. I don't know what kind of style she was going for but it turned out to be HORRIBLE! My hair was LONG, down to my lower back and I specifically said that I wanted to keep it long and just wanted a trim. Lo and behold, my hair is now just past my mid-back a little.. meaning 4-5 inches were off!? I also wanted to keep the angled style and I have 2 huge chunks of hair that was cut straight across on each side towards the front of my face and then all of a sudden the back portion is like 6 inches longer? I thought angled hair-cuts are suppose to go down evenly (think a straight point A to point B line), not cut and inverted (imagine resembling the tetris T)?! And last but not least of my rant- I also specifically said I wanted to GROW out my long layers in the back (meaning DON'T touch them) and yet, about 4 inches were taken off! Ugh! Now I have to deal with this mess and hold my hair up in a pony-tail for at least 6 months for this sh*t to grow back. Nonetheless, I am VERY disappointed and extremely annoyed since I've only had nothing but great results from Mimi. Next time, I will just BOOK a hair appt with Mimi- no more walk-ins. On a side note, any yelpers recommend any remedies for faster hair growth?! yes, it's THAT bad and yes, I'm THAT desperate!!!!!!!!!!",negative
I went to this salon thanks to Yelp. I was very pleased with the service and with the prices. I have searched for years for a decent hair stylist and hit the jackpot with Ricky! Everyone in the salon is friendly and the place is upbeat even when they are busy. It was the first time I got exactly what I asked for. Ricky did an amazing job and actually listened to what I had to say. I wanted something low maintenance and he showed me a quick way to style the hair that I can actually replicate at home. They also handle all ethnicities of hair!,positive
"I would never go here again. I don't know who's worse Mimi or the owner. My cut was horribly uneven and my ombre was even worse. I had more color on one side than the other. It looked like bad highlights. I had to go somewhere else to have them fix the cut and I had to color my entire hair black which was ruff because I have a sensitive scalp, hence getting my hair ombre. Everything just got worse as days went along and when I called to speak to the manager she acted like she didn't care and was too busy. I'm not going back to someone who messed up my hair in the first place for them to possible make it worse. I gave them a shot based on reviews and apparently I was wrong. I would have just preferred my money back because they provided a service that I did not receive.",negative
"This is the BEST salon! Ive lived in Charlotte 9yrs and feel like Ive FINALLY found a stylist that hears what I want in a style/cut. Meemee is awesome, I highly recommend her. The salon is in a wonderful plaza that is conveniently off of 74. Thank you for helping me feel confident! The cut/style I got today was fabulous and my husband agrees that I look like a whole new woman.",positive
"I had my hair cut and colored by the same stylists since I was 12! Since I've moved to Charlotte, I've been on a search for new stylists that I can depend on that were friendly, detail oriented, and reasonably priced. The staff at Sassy Salon surpass my expectations everytime. Van and her staff are a lifesaver!",positive
"First off let me start with the fact that I am extremely picky when it comes to my hair, and my salon. Since I have moved here from Florida I have found it nearly impossible to find somewhere with a comfortable atmosphere, great service, and most importantly great skills. I would recommend this salon to any & every one. Vann did my hair and changed it from dark brown to an awesome deep red. I am so in love ! I will not be searching any longer for a hair salon after finding this place.",positive
"Busy location but worth the wait :) Van did amazing on my full foil highlights and I am a very happy girl, she is a blessing!! :) highly recommend this place. Comfortable, great prices and great people.",positive
"I thought that my hair had no hope before I came Sassy Salon. It had been dyed and fried one too many times. I am new to Charlotte and was told that this was the salon to go to. MeeMee was amazing!!! She knew exactly what I wanted.I had the whole works--cut, color, and highlights. My hair felt so healthy and the cut and color was beautiful. I have been getting compliments everywhere that I go. I am so lucky to have found Sassy Salon and my new favorite Hair stylist!!",positive
"Service is great, fast service even for walk-in, last but not the least Meemee is a great hair stylist. She cut my hair just the way I wanted it.",positive
"I'm the aformentioned ""buddy"" Chris M. referred to..been going here for about 9 months and have always got a great cut for a great price. My cut is relatively simple: a #2 guard buzz up around all sides and clipped on top but you'd be amazed how many bad haircuts I've gotten with this simple cut...Van is the best and spends time after the buzzing going back and clipping and shaping it out...my mom was a lifetime hairdresser so I can tell if someone goes the extra mile to make it look right and she always does..I forgot to post on here before but i did give a couple FB shouts about this hidden gem of a shop",positive
"I would have never walked into any place called ""Sassy"" if it wasn't for Yelp, so thanks! I decided to check it out because I was fed up with Sports clips. All the stylists seem to be Asian, my silver white Jew-fro caused quite a stir, LOL! There was no wait, Mimi gave me a great scissor cut and was fun to chat with, plus it was cheap, so what's there not to like?",positive
"This is a great place to get a haircut! I went for the first time yesterday on a buddy's recommendation and I was extraordinarily pleased with the entire experience. Van is quite lovely and made me feel as welcome as if I'd been a customer for years. Just thinking about chatting with her and her staff makes me smile -- they are just so kind, friendly, and utterly charming. She is a master of the clippers; her movements were deft and nimble, but with patient attention to detail. Considering my limited guidance was ""Kind of short in the back, but not as much off the top,"" I'd say she has a real talent for the craft. Van trimmed and balanced everything into exactly what my hair should look like. I really, really liked the results. But I really, really, REALLY liked the shampoo and head massage that followed. A great cut and then a relaxing head massage?!?! Unbeatable, and only $15. I'd go back right now if I hadn't just gotten a haircut. Give the Sassy Salon a try -- you'll be glad you did.",positive
"I came to Charlotte solo in spring of 2012, without knowing anyone or anything. I was desperately looking for a quality hair salon at the time. I thank my lucky stars that I found Sassy Salon. The first thing I noticed when I walked in was the welcoming ambiance. The interior design of the salon is very elegant and soothing. On top of that, the staff is super friendly and they know how to make you feel like ""family"". Moving on to the ""skills that pay the bills"", Van really knows how to cut men's hair with style and she does it quickly and effortlessly. Then they top it off with a shampoo and head massage that will leave you sleepy. Probably the best haircutting experience I've ever had. I was hooked from day one. To the whole crew at Sassy Salon, you guys rock!!",positive
"Van and Nancy...... I love you! This place is the ONLY I will let mess with my hair. After living all throughout the US, I had never found an establishment that consistently provided both good customer service and a great haircut. Then arrives Sassy Salon and after 1 year- i have yet to go anywhere else. Great service, great people with tremedous skill. They make you feel at home and are quite genuine about it. Friendly, efficient, clean and an overall awesome atmosphere.",positive
"A friend of mine recommended sassy salon to me about a month ago. Van did not disappoint. While I still have love for modern salon and spa, I like going to different places and trying different stylists from time to time. And it's always fun when you find a stylist that you are comfortable with. This salon is clean and nice on the inside. Van and her staff are friendly and have lots of personality. Cracking jokes, good conversation. It's a nice environment. But most of all, everyone who has gotten a cut or color there has been pleased. That's key. It doesn't hurt that it's very reasonably priced either! Just make sure to make a reservation!",positive
"I am not a girlie girl by the standards of most. I will run through a creek bare footed and pick up a frog with my bare hands. I'm not a fashionista, and I would say I'm not even really that cool. I mean, I am cool, but that nerdy type of artsy cool. So after that senseless ramble above, what's my point, right? Well, although I may not be the most trendy gal around, I do have a crazy obsession with my hair. I grow it out, cut it off, color it blonde, go back to brown, add red, highlights, color, layers etc. I can't get enough. Sassy Salon is a small little place in a strip mall that looks a bit deceiving as you drive by. I can honestly tell you, I would have never just wandered into this place by chance. I have NO idea how I even came across the place originally, but I can tell you why I go there now. I work for a company that makes us stay pretty conservative with our hair styles and color. Being an artsy fartsy type, I cannot stand that and I get bored pretty easily. A gal I work with came in with a cutting edge style and color that stuck out, even in a conservative work place, but was still considered acceptable. I asked her where she went, and Sassy Salon is the place she recommended. I drove over for the first time, and told Van what I wanted, or at least an idea of it. She saw the pictures that I wasn't allowed to do at work, and came up with the low key versions to still help me not feel plain. She and Song are so personable and friendly, and I enjoy going to get my hair done here. First, she listens to what you truly want, and my hair always looks great. Second... OH MY GOD, the scalp massage. It is AMAZINGGGGGGGG.... I wasn't even expecting that the first time I'd gone. When she took me over to the bowl to rinse my hair, this amazing relaxing massage started and I thought I was going to have to be carried out of the place from sheer relaxation. I'm just glad I didn't pass out and start drooling on myself. Wow... I'd go there and pay them JUST for the scalp massage!!! They do accept walk ins, but she is in high demand, so it's not always easy to get a walk in. I'd say to get an appointment, makes it easier on you and the salon. I always feel great when I leave, and the best part is the price. I usually get a highlight, low light, cut and scalp massage for around $80. I highly recommend this place, but if you drool all over yourself, then don't say I didn't warn you!! :)",positive
"This is such a great addition to the Super G plaza. Or at least that is what I am calling it. Sassy is owned by Van, a kind and very sassy stylist. I send my international students from Asia here for hair cuts, the guys and the gals. I just got a straight perm and trim here for $65, and she told me to drop by in between visits for free touch ups on my bangs since my hair grows back so quickly. You can't beat that.",positive
Sharlina is a total pro!! She has a passion for being a stylist and takes her time to learn what's important to you about your hair/look. She is very helpful in offering suggestions and she totally delivers on the look!,positive
Sharlina is an expert. Able to transform color to exactly what's desired and keep it looking natural and healthy. Love my hair! She is patient and veryyy detail oriented. And she takes the time to listen.,positive
I can not say enough about Sharlina! She is amazing! She made me feel like a new person! The color choice and style she suggested for me are perfect. She is so talented! I would recommend everyone to go to her - even if you have a hair stylist - just try her once and you will be won over!,positive
"Sharlina is hands down the best stylist I've ever visited (London, New York, Chicago, Detroit). I get compliments on my hair all the time - her balayage color is impeccable. Sitting in her chair always makes me feel pampered, and is guaranteed for a good laugh and chat.",positive
"I have never colored my hair before so I was taking a leap of faith and stepping out of my comfort zone. From the moment I met Sharlina, I knew I could trust her 100%. Her knowledge of coloring and cutting, along with her professionalism was beyond my expectations. She is so detail-oriented and does not let anything go missed. She takes her time to make sure everything is executed perfectlyZ She believes in her work and puts everything into it to make her clients happy. I received a cut, balayage and glaze on my hair and it turned out WAY better than I could imagine! I will definitely be coming back to Sharlina for all my coloring needs and recommending her to friends.",positive
"Sharlina is the best! She is always willing to discuss my latest hair change, while still focusing on the overall end goal and helping me articulate what I want. Sharlina is so friendly and she has a very cozy space. It took me awhile to find a new stylist when I moved here, and I'm so glad I met her!",positive
"Ben delivers good ol' fashion service! I had a wonderful mani & pedi. No nickel and diming...what you ask for you get, rather than trying to Upsell you on everything! I love this place!",positive
Absolutely AMAZING! Ben and his team are so wonderful and such great customer service. I love there work and i make the 20 minute drive to go to there shop when i have one right around the corner from me. I will keep on sending people to this location! :),positive
"I took the Saver's parking lot to the Pet Hotel & noticed a sandwich board that said salon, nails, massage, etc. Yes!! II needed to get my nails done today - I'll see if they do acrylics & take walk-ins. I got right in! Found out about all their services, got an acrylic mani/pedi, my legs. & facial hair waxed, it was greatnext time Im going to get a massage & try eyelash extensions. They are very nice, gentle, & did a fine job. Glad to find a reasonable nice place!",positive
"This is a new, gorgeous, clean full service salon. Nails, hair, lashes, laser, Botox, etc. Ben is the salon owner and absolutely amazing at nails. I broke a nail that was done in LA and he was able to color match my holographic nails with short notice and make me feel whole again! The customer service is exceptional and I will definitely be back for their nail and lash services!",positive
"This place is amazing!! We love to come in and spend quality time together. The staff are all very nice and polite and do good work. BEN, the owner, is awesome!! I recommend this business to anyone looking for any nail or spa or hair appointments!! They will open the new skin care salon at the end of October!!! FIRST CLASS SPA AND SERVICE!!!!!",positive
Customer service is great and the overall quality of their work is phenomenal. They have a good selection of products to choose from and have a coffee bar with snacks to enjoy while you wait. This is def. my new pampering spot!,positive
First timer: Ben the owner is a very interesting man and his wife Diem did exactly what I wanted to to repair my acrylic fingernails and two toenails. Will definitely return.,positive
"This was the most amazing nail salon visit I have ever experienced! Great place owned by a married couple and they just took over the business and revamped the place. Best gel nails I have ever gotten done and I've been trying to find a great nail place for 15 years! The treatment you get is top notch! I won't go anywhere else- they really take their time - it's not rushed at all, I love it! Also they are open on Sunday from 11-5 only nail place within distance that is open Sundays!",positive
"Wow, I wish I lived closer! On vacation, found this place on yelp and loved it!!!! The facility is very clean and professional. When we arrived we were greeted with a cold bottle of water, and sat quickly. I got the #1 pedicure and got a phenomenal foot/leg massage, great paint job and to top it off a neck and back massage. If I had more time I'd try out one of the massage rooms, they are beautiful. I highly recommend this place!",positive
"AMAZING PEDICURE!!! This is the best pedicure I've ever gotten, they even use a hot stone and really massage your legs (I almost fell asleep it was so relaxing:) definitely coming back!!! They just got new owners so that is why there is such a lack of reviews!(:",positive
"I will never go anywhere else again!! This salon is amazing! I was referred to them by a friend who raved about their services and pricing, so I went today after work to check it out. First of all, they have a grand opening promo special that is $15 dollars for a full spa pedicure, full set, or gel manicure. The pedicure was wonderful! They did such fantastic job, the massage was to die for and they gave me hot stones after the massage. I also got a full set from Diem and she did such an amazing job!!!! She did the exact shape I wanted and gave me a beautiful ombré with pink and sparkles. They couldn't have been more friendly and pleasant. My nails came out perfectly and the price can not be beat! Everyone needs to check this place out! They truly deserve the business. I got the full treatment and couldn't be more satisfied!",positive
"A fantastic full service salon. Under new ownership, this salon has a clean relaxing atmosphere. The prices are very competitive. My wife and I had a pedicure which was wonderful. They even painted our 4 year old daughters nails. We will definitely be back.",positive
"Great service! Their team of staff took good care of my mom, aunt, and I. It's nice going to a salon that cares about quality over quantity. They took their time to make sure all of our mani pedis were done to perfection. I will definitely will be coming back when I'm in town!",positive
"I came to this place for a Groupon Deal a Spa Pedicure and a Gel Manicure on Saturday. The staff was very friendly and welcoming. They are reasonably priced even without the Groupon Deals. However, when I got my pedicure and manicure the lady barley scribed my hands and my feet. Not only that, but my Gel Manicure began coming off! Even though she put three coats on my nails there was not enough time for the gel to be dried.",positive
"Very disappointed in my nails after a week, they were peeling after just four days. That has never happened to me with gel nails. My cuticles were not soaked and barley removed with something that looked like tweezers, and no cuticle remover was ever put on my toes or fingers. I hate that I paid for the Groupon, for what I have to show now. The woman who did my service was very nice though, per personality gets two stars as does the cleanliness of the shop.",negative
"I got a gel manicure and spa pedicure with Andi, and she did AMAZING! she did an ombré glitter on my fingers & absolutely nailed it. i purchased a Groupon originally but have gone back since and paid full price! totally worth it!",positive
"My original hair stylist quit and so I was scheduled an appointment with a different stylist. Which is fine. I show up to my 9:00am appointment and the stylist - Katie I think- hasn't showed up to work yet, the gentleman at the didn't desk calls her and says she is on her way and that she will be there in about 15-20 minutes and would comp my service due to the inconvenience. Very nice of him to do so. I show up 35 minutes later and the girl still isn't there. So I left and said I wouldn't be coming back. I feel bad for management, it was obvious they felt bad, but this appointment was scheduled for a week before my wedding. Super inconvenient and the last thing I need to worry about at this time. Wouldn't recommend this salon, what a joke.",negative
Katie is awesome. She did such a thorough job on my hair. I would totally keep going there if I wasn't moving. Gave me such great advice and was great to talk to. I got full highlights on red hair and turned out PERFECT. So grateful. Everyone else at this salon seemed very friendly as well :),positive
"Need More Stars! Whenever I am looking to find a new service provider, I look for a Groupon, right? I hit the Jackpot this time with Jennifer (Jen)!!! I have been growing my hair out from a pixie and was so sick of the ""in betweens."" I was ready to give up and chop it off but Jen convinced me to be patient and that I was almost through the rough part. She took out some of the bulk ( I have a TON of hair) and told me next appointment I should be where I need to be for the style I wanted. She didn't touch the length, just lightened the load a bit, lol.. It looked great and felt much better. 5 weeks later, I went again and got the best haircut of my life!! To my delight, she cut my hair dry, again, so that she could see how my crazy hairline grows and how to cut WITH the cowlicks so that I wouldn't have to fight them. The result was a haircut that literally falls into place AND it's so versatile that I can blow it straight or let it air dry wavy. Thank you, Jen. I am so glad I found you!",positive
"I came across this place via Groupon for a 90 minute massage. While looking at their website I noticed they had $40 hair cuts which I thought was pretty reasonable these days. So I decided to make an appt. To which they offered me a Groupon deal of $20! I'm always a little nervous going somewhere new to get my hair cut, especially since I wanted something more than just a trim. Katie was who I got and she was SO great! For one, it can always be a little awkward if the person can't hold a conversation. We chatted most the entire time and it wasn't awkward at all. I gave her an idea and showed a picture of what I wanted. She asked me hair related questions throughout (leaving me with longer layers since I have to wear mine up at work). I felt like she knew exactly what I wanted without me really having to say anything! I'm so happy to say I found someone who I will continue going back to! The receptionist at the front desk was also wonderful! Very attentive and kind.",positive
"I've had a great couple of haircuts with Brianna ..she is very friendly and pays attention to what you want, going to a new stylist can be stressful but she will put you at ease. I have loved my haircuts and will continue to go to her because of the attention to detail and great customer service! I gladly recommend Brianna to anyone looking for a great haircut!",positive
"What a great experience with all our services! Love my lashes by Amanda & massage by Tuan! My daughters hair for prom came out amazing with full highlights, cut and up-do...thank you Katie! Everyone was very professional and accommodating. We'll be back!",positive
"This is a hidden gem in Scottsdale. Let's be honest there really are a lot of places to go in the Scottsdale area, but very few that treat you like an old friend. Shona Salon & Spa is that rare exception. The staff is friendly and they were totally willing to accommodate me needing a haircut at the last minute. The salon itself is very clean..smells like a spa you would find at a ""fancy"" resort..and is well laid out. Bri did my haircut. She was VERY personable and asked a lot of questions, which I like. She made sure that I was happy every step of the way and the shampoo was AMAZING. I don't know about you, but that is always my favorite part. She made sure the water was just the right temperature, the products she used smelled GREAT and the massage of my scalp was so relaxing. After returning to her station she used more GREAT smelling product and styled me up. I got a peek at the spa side. Very quiet, relaxing and again the WONDERFUL smells. I also found out if you happen to book an appointment after 5pm you get a discount..so that's nice. Overall a GREAT experience. I would love to try the spa side of things to see how it compares to other places I have been. I know their prices are VERY reasonable..so that is also a draw. Definitely worth checking out!",positive
"They had a special where you buy a 100 dollar gift card for only 50 bucks, great deal. Even though they were super booked, they were able to get me in early on Saturday. Bri did my hair and she did an amazing job, my hair is super damaged and fine and she was still able to lighten it without frying my hair. She massaged my head while washing my hair, I almost fell asleep because it was so nice and relaxing. After she dried it, my hair looked and felt so healthy and soft. Bri even recommended products to me without being pushy about it. I ended up picking out something to help reduce the damage in my hair, it was 15 percent off products too! Even more off if you bought more than one. The bill wasn't bad at all, very reasonable for a high end salon. The two front desk ladies were very sweet and helpful too. Janet is one of them and she rocks! Will definitely be back :)",positive
I got my hair cut for the first time at Shona salon and spa 1/7/16 right when I walked in I was greeted by the nicest front desk lady Janet and was offered water while I had to fill out a paper which was great! She was so nice and friendly! Then I had Ashley D cut my hair very friendly and did a PERFECT job exactly what I imagined probably better! Completely satisfied and will Defiantly be back for other services! Highly recommend!,positive
"So found this great deal in Groupon and was excited to come for a massage! I booked a same day appointment which was nice because they had a cancellation. The spa area was really nice and relaxing so the setting is good despite being in a strip mall. The staff were friendly and helpful, the rooms were clean, hence the two stars. Now for the actual service.. My masseuse either did not know what he was doing it was totally checked out for that day because he didn't even try to work a single knot out of my back or shoulders (the two areas I asked specifically asked to focus on). It was like a back rub not a massage. Additionally, i asked him to make it warmer in the room, I don't think He did. Then when he briefly massaged my feet they were freezing, I said ""sorry my feet are cold"" hoping he'd get my hint, but instead he said ""oh that's okay"". Usually I would get a nice toasty blanket or something, but not today. Also I've had a lot of massages, but never did a masseuse actually pour oil directly onto my skin - I could literally feel the drops sliding down my arms haha I can't help but laugh at this point because what's a girl to do! The whole thing left a bit to be desired. Not sure if I got a bad masseuse or what but I don't think I'll be back. So disappointed!",negative
"Place: bright, big and clean! Staff: nice, friendly, clean lol Seriously a nice warm welcoming solan. The staff takes times to listen to your needs and wants and makes them happen. It's clean and greatly priced will definitely go there again and I can't wait to do so!",positive
"Really impressed with the new spa. Friendly staff and very easy to book an appointment with their masseuse Julie. Had the 90 minute deep tissue massage called the ""Stress Fix"". Definitely will be back again!",positive
"I tried Shona Spa for an afternoon of pampering with an Aveda Glow & Go Facial and a Rosemary Mint Awakening Body Wrap. Amanda was my aesthetician - so professional! I love that they have genuine Aveda products, they smell AMAZING! The Facial was excellent, but the Body Wrap - whoa - it made me the good kind of tingly all over, and if that wasn't enough they have this kind of shower with multiple heads that moves OVER YOU as you are lying down - a ton of warm water pours on top of you and rinses you off. I never experienced getting a shower lying down - it was super relaxing and luxurious. I can't wait to return!",positive
"The spa staff was amazing, :) they listened to me and were really flexible with my schedule. The pricing is way better than the other spa's i've been to in Scottsdale. Recently received a waxing service, hair cut and color. It was fast amazing! I'll definitely be going back!",positive
Gabby is amazing! I'm transitioning to my natural salt and pepper hair color and she's helping!! I'm so happy with my results! My hair looks great and I feel so much better about my journey with her helping me along the way. I've gotten so many compliments on how natural it looks.,positive
Going to get my hair cut by Gabby today. Can't wait! She always does an amazing job. I travel 80 miles round trip just to have her do my hair. Tells you how fantastic she is. The salon itself is so beautiful.,positive
"I'm a little particular of my hair and I trust the stylists here and they have a great location, cool decor and great people! I will continue to go here as long as I live here",positive
"I love this place! Relaxing, beautifully decorated décor throughout the building. The staff is very friendly and accommodating. Alexsis did my hair (shampoo, cut, and style), and she was phenomenal. She listened to what I wanted and made suggestions to create a great style for me. Definitely going back for my next cut. I highly recommend Solstice!",positive
"I was in a pinch for time and decided to take a chance on a newer stylist. Well lucky me!!! Paige at Solace Salon did an amazing job on my cut and highlights!!! She suggested that I go a little lighter and a little shorter than normal. I honestly feel like those two suggestions helped me look younger and I feel sassier. I really appreciate her attention to detail. I have a ton of fine baby hair and she made sure to get them, I have had a problem with that in the past. Anyway, love it and no one would know that I am not a natural blonde, I will definitely be back!!!",positive
"Casey was my aesthetician today - she is amazing; I didn't even have to think about whether I wanted to book a follow up appointment. And soonest. My services were: Pure Results Facial with the Get Carded Mini Eye Lift and Lymphatic Drainage Face Detox added on. I feel amazing, the price is reasonable and I felt instantly comfortable as soon as I walked in. Added bonus: while Casey was very informative about the products she used, and why, there was absolutely no pressure to purchase products at the end of the session. I will gladly consult her in the future for my skincare needs, though I felt relieved and appreciative there was no hard sell at the end.",positive
"They allow for you to make online appointments, which I find very convenient. A representative called me the next morning and scheduled me for the morning of December 31st. I saw Dana, who was excellent. I got an all over color and cut. She asked a lot of questions and made sure she knew what I wanted before doing anything. I really enjoyed talking with her as well. The two hours or so just flew by. I would definitely go to this salon again.",positive
"Need your hair cut? Go see the ladies at Solace. I usually see Elena and she is the BEST. I have followed her from salon to salon for years, and even while living in DC I would make a point to make an appointment with her when I was in the area. I have thick, coarse hair and she knows just what to do with it. She cuts the length wet and then styles it dry, so that she knows exactly how it will lay. Not only do you look like a million bucks when you walk out, but it even looks good as it grows out. Elena is an absolute perfectionist and takes time to make sure your hair is perfect. I have also seen Becky and she is fabulous too! She is very skilled and knew exactly how to work with my hair. Becky also dry finished my hair, which I feel makes a big difference for my hair type. I am very particular about my hair and I wholehearted recommend these ladies.",positive
A great product to purchase at solace for medium length to long hair .... sea salt spray from davines .... love love love this stuff,positive
So I bought the groupon for a massage for both my gf and myself and we called and made an appointment with them. This was my first time coming here by my gf has come here many times before. So for my first experience it was great! Everyone was polite and he massages were amazing it was a great day for both of us to just relax in the spa also I loved the waterfall showers We will be coming back soon for another great spa day,positive
I'm an athlete and love great massages. So couch this review knowing this. I asked for a sports massage and got a massage from someone who appeared to be a newbie. Pressure was so soft and you could tell her hands hadn't developed the necessary strength required for a deep massage. For $165 I had higher expectations. To make matters worse I was charged a 20% convenience fee before I even received the service. Since when is tipping 20% expected before a service?? What if the service sucks? I think expecting a tip is a very bad practice.,negative
The spa is wonderful. The decor is lovely and relaxing. Nina was a great esthetician. I had the Vitamin C facial with her and my skin looks and feels AMAZING! I had been on a road trip that ended in Vegas and my skin was felling not its best. When I walked out there I was glowing. She knew the right essential oils to use to calm my skin down. I was relaxed and felt great. The spa attendant was very sweet and took care of me well too. I will definitely be going back next time we are in town.,positive
So here's the deal.. Sunday-Thursday is 30% off for locals. It's not worth it full price! A spa pass is $45 for the day with no services. There is no discount on the spa pass so my way around it is get a $45 dollar manicure with the local discount it's $31.50 plus gratuity then hang out all day. At least u get a mani and spa pass for less than just the pass. My manicure sucked but my sisters turned out nice. The facility is nice and clean. I think I'd request who my sister got next time I come alone so then it would make it even better. Update: I was offered a redo manicure the day after I posted this! I requested Danielle because my sister went to her! I'm very pleased and added that 5th star for customer service and a great mani and conversation with Danielle:),positive
"I have to give mixed reviews about this place. First, the massage was amazing, although the woman had no personality. It was a great massage! I was irritated because when I left and went to take care of my bill, that is when the problems occurred. I had a gift certificate I received for a bday present. I have the receptionist my gift card- I was told my gift card was only worth--- amount . I told them my gift certificate stated good for one 80 minute massage. The woman preceded to tell me that they proves went up and now my gift certificate is not worth the entire amount if an 80 minute massage. Wth!? No where in the gift certificate did it state it wouldn't be worth the entire amount ever nor did it have an expiration date. Then they ended up put a 40$ service fee added on top... ended up paying $70 more on top of the gift certificate that was already over 120$. This was ridiculous and I will never return back to this establishment...ever! Beware- do not buy a gift certificate here ever!!!!",negative
I had a prenatal massage with Evelyn yesterday. It was my first prenatal massage. I was 21 weeks and I did not know what to expect. Evelyn was such a sweetheart! She's so soft spoken that sometimes it's hard to hear her but she's so polite and accommodating. She throughly explained the massage to me to make sure I knew exactly what to expect during this prenatal massage. She started off very gentle and didn't put much pressure on back. I had to ask for more pressure. I normally love deep tissue massages and hate Swedish massage because it's too soft. She was more than understanding and made adjustments as requested. She explained that most first time pregnant women are often afraid of too much pressure on their back/ belly so she always start off soft and adjust as needed. I had my massage on my side. I expected the typical donut type tables for the preggo belly but she explained that it was better to start on my side as this was my first prenatal massage. I'm glad I listened. The scalp and neck part of the massage was incredible! The massage itself was excellent! I felt so much better! So relaxing and my muscles feel much less tight. One thing worth mentioning was the lack of aroma therapy. Most spas smell amazing the minute you walk in. They usually had scented candles to set the mood for relaxation. I was expecting that but that wasn't the case here! It was really odd. It didn't have that spa smell during my visit and I kept thinking I should take deeper breaths to inhale the lavender scent but there was nothing there. Whomp whomp! The spa was very clean. The dressing room was spotless. There was someone there cleaning it at all times. The receptionist was super nice and friendly. I would def come again!,positive
"EXCELLENT SALON AND SPA SERVICES WIT DANIELLE AND KRISTIN Love the staff and services at Spa Aquae. My two favorite staff members are Danielle in the salon and Kristin in the spa. Have been going to Danielle for a couple years now and she does an amazing job with my cut, color and pedis. We hit it off as well from the start ... warm, friendly and incredibly knowledgeable. I'm a newer client of Kristin's and was instantly a fan. She's not only a wealth of knowledge about skin and nutrition but has such a kind and warm personality as well. I have had two custom facials done and my skin is evolving already. Both have done not only do such an excellent job with what but are just two amazing women that I look forward not only to being pampered by, but who enrich my life. As for the rest of the staff ... super helpful and friendly. The facility relaxing and clean. I highly recommend!!!",positive
"I absolutely loved our visit to Spa Aquae this weekend. The staff was amazing and impressed my mother and I with their customer service and professionalism. The spa was clean, very lavish and met all of our standards. I received the blueberry detox facial and loved my esthetician Kristen. Best facial I've received at a spa. Receiving a peel with extractions and not leaving the spa red was very impressive. With her massage techniques I was able to be so relaxed and have the firmest results. Thank you Kristen, I'm glowing. A very big thank you to the spa manager Dean for helping accommodate an appointment for me last minute and with my mother's appointment as well. We truly feel you went above and beyond. We can't wait to be back!",positive
"I was excited to be staying at this Marriott location and decided to take advantage of the spa for a couple of services during that time. I decided on a Quench Pedicure followed by a Coconut Sugar Glow (80 minute with massage). First impressions: I decided to head down about an hour or so before my treatments to enjoy the spa a bit beforehand. I checked in and was taken in to get my shoes and robe and place my things in a locker. I checked out the spa area and decided to read my book in the area near the cold/hot dunk pools. The fruit infused water they had on hand was very refreshing and I relaxed and read for a bit. Unfortunately the weekend I was in Vegas was the rainiest/coldest they had had in awhile so I did not get to try the pool area outside (though I really wanted to!) One thing I noticed that didn't go away, if anything was more noticeable, was that there was a stale smoke smell in the spa. The casino is right out the doors and obviously the ventilation system is not the best since it was apparent even within the confines of Spa Aquae. Pedicure: My pedicurist was very sweet and we had a lovely conversation. She wasn't as thorough with my feet as I would have liked, but they looked pretty when she was finished. One thing I did notice (and it ended up being a problem) is that they don't really have an area/equipment to stick your feet to dry the toes. She fanned at my toes with a set of salon flip flops but they weren't completely dry for my next treatment in 15 minutes. The problem came when I laid face down on the massage table, my big toes ended up getting smudged big time (which I didn't notice until I was getting redressed in the locker room). For the price, that was disappointing. Sugar Glow/Massage: This service was amazing and worth every penny. My skin felt so soft afterwards and the massage done at the end confirmed my new identity as butter. The facilities were dimly lit and the table comfortable. The shower that I had to use to rinse off the sugar could definitely use an update (broken tiles, etc). I would have this service completed again in the future as it was a nice alternative to a traditional massage. Overall experience: Am I happy I had some ""me"" time at the spa? Of course. Would I return to this location and pay the prices listed? (I had a discount with the group I was with): No. I would research and find another spa in town. The stale smoky smell that permeated the spa areas was also troublesome because let's face it, it's the last thing you want lingering in the air when you're trying to relax.",negative
"This place is a hidden gem! I was looking for a place to do some yoga classes here in Summerlin. They offer a deal where you can pay for six classes for $90. Since this was pretty good pricing, I decided to go. The big surprise was that you can use the spa amenities all day for that price! They have a gym, sauna, indoor heated pool, indoor hot tub, and a beautiful outdoor heated pool with spa jets. The yoga classes are held in a room with large windows overlooking the heated pool. They provide a robe, towels, water, and fresh fruit all free of charge. They also offer the other spot amenities make massages for an additional charge. This is definitely a great deal if you would like to take yoga classes, since most yoga places do not have the additional amenities.",positive
This update is way over due!! Last month I had my nails done by Brenda and she was so awesome and the only reason I'm giving 5 stars. Still disappointed that this spa doesn't offer a better color selection for the prices and still no glitter or fun things to add to nails. But Brenda was so sweet and very easy to converse with!,positive
"Most importantly VERY CLEAN SPA! Even after a bit of a flood this place is still one of the best spas in the country. Friendly staff, great amenities, very well managed. Very relaxing place to get away form the strip. Book treatments in advance as they tend to be busy on weekends. It is a great hotel property as well. Everyone I have encountered here right down to the valets are excellent. Thank you Mark for your help!",positive
"This is the second time I have been here and I have to say the second time was less than desirable. The first time was amazing, very attentive staff. The facility was in great shape. A few years later and this place is run down. The women's side showers were out of order, ALL OF THEM! we were escorted to a shower to use that was a quarter of the size of my hotel room shower up stairs, away from everything. Someone should really come in and renovate. Replace broken tiles, fix plumbing, etc. get this place back to where it should be.",negative
The first time I had a service at this spa I was underwhelmed. Half of the women's side is out of order or doesn't work well. Most of the areas are too bright and nosy. The whole thing is in desperate need of an update! I walked in and was greeted by four attendants who were all smashed behind an awkward table. I was taken to my locker that is not private in the slightest. The attendant walked me around to show me the facilities telling me certain things were broken. The place was virtually empty on a Sunday. Normally when I go to a spa the music is quieter and the lights are dimmed. Not here. The tiles are not straight and the grout is missing in many places throughout. The chairs are super uncomfortable and look like outdoor furniture. The steam room should just be called a warm room because there was almost no steam. I went outside and enjoyed the pool but noticed most of their 'water therapy' spots were broken. The grout in the pool and spa outside are missing. There are holes in the sides of the pool. The robe they give you is paper thin and not at all plush like most spa robes. If you get your feet wet and put them into the flip flops you will fall over. They called me back for my body wrap and I was taken to a very nice quiet comfortable room (what the rest of the facility should be like). The wrap was wonderful. I would go back if the rest of the facility wasn't so drab and old.,negative
"This spa was so relaxing, the staff takes care of you every step of the way. Everything was clean and smelled nice, from the changing area to the massage room. I got an 80 minutes sports massage, my masseuse found and destroyed all my knots and sore areas. The steam room was soothing and the sauna was clean and big. I would go again.",positive
Great adult spa. Services are top notch but it Is very $$$$... Gym is nice for a workout. Mens spa is clean and attendants are quick to serve. Price brings a 5* down to a 4* otherwise it's flawless,positive
"Massage and facial: four stars. Facilities: two stars. Overall rating: three stars. On the one hand, the technicians are wonderful and the services are really good, if not a little overpriced. On the other hand, the facilities are tired, in my view. I had treatments here about six years ago and the facilities sparkled. Today, I would say there is too much deferred maintenance including filthy plunge pools (e.g., cloudy with hair and band aids floating in them rather than Crystal clear water), moldy grout (mold in the desert!), and cracked tiles. It also doesn't help that the scent of cigarette smoke from the casino drifts into the upstairs relaxation/waiting room. If you want good bodywork or a facial from nice people, then go for it. But, at this time I do not recommend the facilities if you want a relaxing time in a comfortable environment; this isn't it.",negative
I paid for a 55 minute pedicure and it was only 45 minutes. I could have used the extra few minutes on my massage or calluses. To be honest the chop shop I go to does a better job for half the price. The ambiance is nice though. The salon has a clever way of automatically putting 20 percent towards their tip so if you don't believe your service is worth this much you have to tell them to make an adjustment.,negative
"This place like the entire hotel is in need of an update. Half the spa facilities are broken and usable like the hot tub, steam room and mineral baths. They had water and tea available but no hot water, the hot water cooler was broken. Service was nice and friendly.",negative
"First time here and first time at JW Marriott. Amazing first visit and I will be back. Friendly staff, super clean facility! I have been to many spas and this time I tried the desert stone massage. Sincerely I loved it way better than a Swedish massage! I fell in love! The waterfall showers are an experience itself. It wasn't busy which makes it more relaxing. There is a private pool outside the gym portion, steam rooms, saunas, an indoor pool and hot tub just in the woman's side. Honestly for the price, you must treat yourself to a desert stone massage.

"I really enjoy this spa and I love it even more when they are having the locals discount. I have tried many of the services, but my favorite is still the 55 minute Swedish massage and 55 min Desert facial. It is really nice in spring and summer to have lunch at the private spa pool. They offer healthy choices that are delicious. The spa outdoor pool is really nice with all the different out coves. They used to have a really nice selection of fruit and juices. This has gone downhill a little bit, but still a great place to go.",positive
"My hubby and I booked a couples massage for our last getaway before the baby comes. It was my hubby's first massage ever and now he is hooked. The women were very accomidating and professional! They have special pillows that allow for pregnant women to lay on their bellies for their massage and that was amazing! I was worried as to how relaxed I would get if I had to stay sitting up or just on my back the whole time. The indoor womens area was very clean and pretty quiet. The indoor pools are cool, lukewarm, and hot. The lukewarm is perfect for a good mommy to be soak as it isn't much warmer than room temp. Thier is a sauna, steam room, waterfall showers, and normal showers with soap, shampoo, conditioner and lotion in the stall. The only downside to this place is that if you are getting a couples treatment, there is no inside waiting area to be with your mate. The only places you can relax is at the private spa outdoor pool or the gym area. The only other place you meet is the waiting room for your treatment. I really wanted to be close to my hubby before our treatment where we could hang out and talk in a comfy area. not just the quiet room or super loud gym. The private pool outside was very nice, although the small pool was closed. Aromatherepy or hydrotherapy pool perhaps? The water was super cold and no one was in the pool. Was a bummer since being pregnant, I can't use the hot tub. There are no umbrellas for the afternoon sun.",positive
"The Hot Water Shower issue in the Men's Spa has Finally Been Addressed. Excellent Massages (Ask For Ron for an Amazing Deep Tissue Massage and Locals Discount if you are a Nevada Resident) Dated but Spotless Facilities, however for a $ 45.00 Entry fee do not expect a free Juice bar, Just water and Apples is All. The Hot Water was out for ages and I'm happy to report that you can finally get a Hot Shower. They still have second rate robes and towels when compared to the Qua Spa, however a Spa where there are never huge Crowds (I understand the East Coast Crowd keeps it busy from 6 - 9 AM) makes the place enjoyable. Still a High Price for a Good but not Superior Spa..",positive
"If this wasn't part of the Marriott, it would have 2 stars. But since I am a loyal Marriott customer and know they CAN offer an amazing spa experience, I bumped them up. However, I wouldn't say this one is ""awesome"". First, before we even arrived, I was a little unsure about the atmosphere based on all the pictures on the web. The photos looked more like America's Next Top Model Challenges, that just happened to be set in the spa. The ridiculous poses on the pedicure chairs and plenty of pictures of glamour shots of the girls didn't help me get a feel for the actual spa facilities. We stopped in anyways to hang out and schedule a couple of services - since our experience at other spa's have been amazing, we figured this was a safe bet. On my first visit in over the course of my stay, check-in was a touch painful and involved 2 people to complete: the one very helpful guy and the girl that just stared back at me from behind the desk. It was awkward. She then escorted me to the locker room. And that was were it ended. The locker room attendant proved to be a hit or miss deal - on this particular time she was behind the counter, but many other times during my multiple visits, the desk was empty. I received no real tour of the facilities except for standing in the middle of the room, pointing in the direction of things. I can only tell you for sure that they offer bathrooms, a hot tub and sauna. Those are all the things I found. The facility itself was clean and nice. The locker room is a shared space for getting naked, getting dressed, grooming and...eating? There is a kitchen in the middle of it - which does nothing for me. I think it is a little gross actually. They offer a gym which seemed to be pretty good except for the first 3 treadmills I tried didn't work. While a tad small, they do offer a private pool for the spa guests, which is much nicer than the family circus pool in the main area. However, it is by a walkway so that you are completely on display and with no umbrellas, there is no escaping the sun all day. One thing that stood out compared to other experience, was the lack of pool service. No one came by to take a drink order, clear away used towels or uneaten food, or even do a general picking up. Ii certainly didn't notice any leftover food and used towels lying about in the photos! This was the case throughout the 3 days we were at the spa. It definitely kills the ambiance - especially if you are paying for services or paid to just hang out. We also ran into a snafu and poor service when trying to order lunch. As for the services, I can't complain at all. You have to try pretty hard to make a massage terrible. And the facial was one of the best yet. So at least Aquae Sulis can deliver on the spa treatments...which they do well, so there is hope! They just need to spend less time on the glamour shots and more time on actually creating a glamorous experience. And getting rid of someone's unfinished lunch that has been sitting next to me all day.",negative
"My wonderful husband treated me to a spa day for my birthday and I was thrilled with the package that he selected for me. I started the day with a Coconut Cream Body Scrub and massage. Quinn performed my scrub and massage and it was wonderful. I prefer to have a male masseuse as women tend to overcompensate and rub too hard. Quinn did a great job and worked out all the knots in my back. Ahhh. Next, I had a Custom Concept facial. I hate that I can't remember the woman's name who performed this service, but she had an amazing Russian accent. My pores have never been so squeaky clean and the face and scalp massage was wonderful. After having been scrubbed, massaged, and polished, I headed down to the salon for a pedicure. I had the Paradise Pedicure and it was very nice. My toes look perfect and Jessica did a great job smoothing out all my rough edges. :) I received a full grand tour of the spa and did also use the gym which had a wide variety of machines and free weights. Everything was in good working order and I was very pleased with the service and the spa treatment. I would definitely go back!",positive
"The massage was wonderful but the check in to the spa is the real let down. As another reviewer noted, it was unprofessional. You go through two check-ins, yet they never give you a tour of the spa like other spas do. A quick walk through of the facilities would be appreciated for the amount of money you pay. I almost missed the waterfall showers but luckily I didn't. They were so unusual I used them twice. Nothing like heavy water falling on your aching muscles, pooling at your feet. Hubby booked me for a spa sampler, an 80 minute treatment of body, scalp and foot massage. I added on a facial. I'd give 5 stars alone to Mitch for the massage treatment. He was professional and courteous, providing the right amount of pressure and making me feel completely relaxed. I usually don't get a male massage therapist but in the future I'd want to clone him. The facial was OK. My skin gets super dry in the desert, so it was necessary but expensive. On par with other hotel spa services, but the facial felt standard, nothing special. The gym was spacious and quiet. They had an ample number of cardio machines and decent weights. I think they tack on an extra $25 or $35 fee if you are just using the gym without a spa treatment (not including waxing), the higher fee if you aren't a hotel guest. Definitely do yourself a favor and book a massage with Mitch, then give yourself at least 1.5 hours to work out and use the dry sauna, steam room, cold and warm pools, and those wonderful waterfall showers.",negative
"Is it possible to give zero stars? If so, I would. My friend and I had comped day passes to check out the spa, and decided if we liked it, we would stay and get a massage and pedicure. We left after 10 minutes. First of all, check in was completely unprofessional. The locker facility at my LVAC location is nicer than the women's changing room here. The outdoor hydrotherapy pool was closed, there were 2 bugs in the steam room, the showers out by the plunge pools were closed, and about 6 of the workout machines were out of order. We got of there quickly and decided to go to Red Rock next week, which is one of my favorites. I'll let you know how it goes, but ANYTHING would be better than Aquae Sulis.",negative
"Came here with my sister after a bachelorette party weekend. Our feet were abused, our bodies ravaged from late nights of dancing/walking/carrying intoxicated friends out of clubs... on top of that, work had also taken its toll. From what my sister told me, she said her massage was all sorts of amazing. For myself, let's just say i asked what my masseuse was doing the following day/week(can i take you home with me, please??) it was everything I hoped for it to be. My sister and i had a great time. We stayed in here for several hours, simply because we refused to leave... it was very tranquil and comfortable. I wouldn't mind making visits here a ritual. I definitely plan on dropping by whenever I'm in town.",positive
"I have been going to Aqua Sulis Spa for about a year now and have had my hair and nails done about 5 or 6 times. Every experience has been nothing short of fantastic. The service is always exceptional, i feel right at home, and have met some really great friends. I learned during my more recent visit that anytime one receives service they then receive an all day access to all the amenities the spa has to offer. (this includes gym, pool, spa, sauna, steam room, showers) my girlfriend and i spent a good 3 hours working out, relaxing by the pool, taking a dip when the 110 degree weather got a little too unbearable, enjoyed the steam room, as well as the sauna, and even used the shower which included shampoo, conditioner, shower gel, and shaving cream. to use the gym, pool, etc costs one $20 a day. a membership is $150 a month. i am seriously considering purchasing a membership, as everything that i need to get in a great workout is there and it is 10x's nicer and enjoyable than a 24 hour fitness or LVAC.",positive
"I've been to this spa multiple times and have throughly enjoyed the experience. The facilities are very nice w/ fresh fruit, juices, and water to enjoy as you please. Television w/ couches and magazines to relax. Cold towels w/ fresh slices of cucumber await outside the steam rooms. Cold and Hot dip jacuzzi's. Co-ed workout and outdoor pool area. The staff is also very attentive and keeps everything in order. The one downside about this place is the fact you have to walk through a very loud casino to get to it.",positive
Johnna is an amazing masseuse! She is very concerned about providing you a massage you are happy with. She asks if the pressure is good and she is very professional. One of the best massages I have ever had. I would definitely recommend Johnna!,positive
"I went to Spa in the Hollow for a Brazilian wax. The first time I ever got a wax I went to Capristo Salon. Spa in the Hollow was definitely not up to the caliber of Capristo. The towels that were on the table I laid on we're severly stained. They looked like they had been washed but because the towels were white you could still see old stains. It was pretty gross looking. Patty was really nice. She was pleasant throughout the appointment and made me feel comfortable. The waxing job wasn't horrible, but it wasn't great either. I still have multiple stray hairs and I've been dealing with wax residue all day. There are so may stray hairs, I'll probably have to go over it with a razor. The only reason I would go back is because you can't really beat the groupon price. At Capristo you'll pay $70 for the same thing. If you can afford Capristo, it's most definitely a better experience, but if you're strapped for cash Spa in the Hollow will get most of the job done.",negative
I think Lisa gives the best facial in the area! Extermly knowledgeable and helpful. Beth the lady on the desk is the most professional and sweetest lady! I would go back for services.,positive
"A really nice, well maintained day spa. They offer basically everything and my first experience here was a pre-natal massage. HEAVENLY. My husband also got a massage at the same time and said he's never felt better afterwards. Every massage he has had since then (it's been a year...kinda late on this review) has paled in comparison and he still talks about this place. The brazilians are also quick and she makes them bearable by distracting you with conversation and humor. The first time I came here I missed the entrance, so just slow down and watch out for it.",positive
"Had a pedicure here today and the pedicure itself was good and the lady who preformed the service was very nice and conscientious. Here's my issue... The spa itself is in drastic need of a makeover. Lavender walls, peeling wall paper, an occasional black ant on the floor. I don't know the atmosphere reminded me of old school Pittsburgh. Honestly, it was kinda a turnoff. I probably won't be back.",negative
"Husband came here for a haircut, and said it was the best service he's ever received. I later referred my boss when she was in search for a new haircut location for her son, and her son refuses to go anywhere else now! Andi is phenomenal, and her team is as well! I come in for products and they are all knowledgeable on what they all offer and what is the best product for any circumstance. I recommend this place like it's my side job to everyone I meet.",positive
"I have been here two times before and my experiences were quite good, until few days ago i went in again and had a nightmare. I did my hair with this specific stylist before (couldn't remember her name) but she is not there when i visited. So i made a decision that will probably make my regret for a month, i chose the first available stylist. I dont know if she just started this career or whatever, she did not seem to know how to cut one's hair. All she can do is using the cutter and adaptors with different hair length settings. And no, i do not think she can use a pair of scissors. I wanted a round shaped top, yet since she was using a cutter with adaptor of the same length, my hair came out to be square shaped! Sorry i forgot to mention, she did use the scissors, but what i got on top of my head is something you will find after your dog bites it. All in all, i'm not saying all stylists here are like her, but be careful who is doing you hair. Just a friendly reminder guys.",negative
The girls are very nice! Maddie is my favorite and love the MVP! I think that it it the best value and definitely worth it with the steam towels and massage. Their products they use are also very good and smell great.,positive
"To start with I never would have considered such a place for a hair cut as I have always been a customer for traditional male barbers. I was given a free coupon. Much to my delite, they honored it completely with no pressure, no upsales, no extra fees. 100% actually free. I thought it was an excellent, relaxing experience. Im picky about my man look. I requested a small list of special needs. The stylist, Anna, listened carefully and executed perfectly the hair cut i wanted. I was quite pleased and would highly recommend this business and herself personally to anyone. Great job Anna!",positive
"I've been in here 3 times and had 3 separate stylists. Each one does a fantastic job and will work with you in every way they can to make sure your haircut is perfect. The staff is friendly and personable. I've been to Great Clips, Master-Cuts, and BoRicks, and this is the ONLY place that has done a good job for the price. I highly recommend them to men and women like myself who like to keep their hair on the shorter side. I also like how they don't try and shove products down your throat or try and gussy up your hair to give off the illusion that it looks well cut when it isn't. They do it right the first time and are more than willing to make sure it looks clean and well presented. Thanks Ladies!! :)",positive
AJ rocks. I love SportClips. Every month it's a new adventure of fun and hair care. Everything about these folks is first class. I highly recommend. His should have been for the Old Farm Shop location on Kirby so go there as the location on Neil is not as good.,positive
"I do not even trust this place to fix the abomination on my head. They rubbed all sorts of shit products they were hard selling into my hair, and despite giving them the exact same description of what I wanted that I've given to Supercuts for years, I've never in my life looked more like a douche bag. It took all of 5 minutes of driving away before the Nevada summer sun dried my hair enough to see this bloody abortion on my scalp. I would rather shave bald than continue with this nightmare. I will be paying the $17 to visit mothersucking Supercuts, the walmart of hair cutting to fix this garbage. Just in case it's not the place and just the barber, don't bother with the hour wait for Ashlea. I have a fistful of cards to give my friends free haircuts, in case I ever want to lose my friends. Nope nope nope nope nope! And the only way to even get in the wait list is putting in your phone number, so I look fucking forward to obnoxious calls and texts requesting my business in 4 weeks ""to keep my style"". The word style used 3 or 4 times. I cannot stress this enough, this lowrent excuse for a building could be replaced by a flowbee operated by yourself while drunk and in a room with no mirrors. Fuck sports clips.",negative
"My son decided that it was time to stop rocking his Slip Knot locks and join the ranks of his new hero Harrison Ford, under one condition. That condition is his hair cut must be done professionally. I heard about this location and they had the Golden Knights game and playing too. We went in and signed in on the computer there is not a human to sign the customer in; so score one for technology. The store was very neat and had a huge flat screen with the Knights game playing too. When he was called she asked if we had ever been here prior and informed me that since we are new that he gets his hair washed for free. Yeah. The stylist looked at the image of Mr Ford on the phone and went to work. I waited for Connor in the waiting area and wow what a transformation from long hair rocker to sophisticated gentleman. Not that the rocker look is out it is not for him anymore. The stylist was so professional and gentle too. She was very quick and had such a pleasant attitude. She paid great attention to detail on how he wanted the back area of his hair. She took direction very well too on making sure the new length that Connor wanted. She was very skilled with the scissors and razor. He could not of been happier with his new look.",positive
"Both my husband and youngest son got their hair cuts here. Very friendly staff, nice atmosphere and both my guys left looking handsome as ever. Tiffany is the best, she was really patient with my 19 month old.",positive
"My husband has been here twice and he's not pleased, last time they messed it up where they had to fix an cut more hair then he asked.",negative
This change of my review is solely on one stylist that intervened with my last visit at this barber shop! I'm not sure what her name is but she's short and has blonde hair and works at the front station to the left! This same stylist cut my son's hair when he use to shave it bald and she left a bunch of long hairs all over his whole head that I had to trim with my clippers when I got home! So the next time we came in he had let his hair growth out and wanted a gentleman cut and it was done amazingly by another stylist in a station to the right with long black hair! So this go round I spoke with her and she told me she would cut my son's hair after the client she was working on! Then the blonde chick who messed my son's hair up last time came and called my son's name and I told her that we were waiting for the other girl and she told me that the other girl was to busy and that she was the only one available! So I expressed to her that she did not do a good job last time she cut my son's hair so to please make sure that she does a good job and she ensured me that she would! To say the least when we got home we were very unsatisfied and here are some images to show why! I'm no expert in the hair business but I know this is not how you fade a haircut! A fade means that you can't see a hairline all the way around your head as if you had a bowl cut!,negative
"I took my 2 year old here for a haircut. The cut looks great, but he was not thrilled about the experience. He's been getting regular haircuts by two other stylists since he was 10 months old. He's not new to the haircut experience. I took him in walk-in style as I was assured on the phone little ones and boys was their specialty. The stylist insisted that he sit alone on the chair even after he made it very clear it was not going to happen. After she compromised, she began by very abrasively spaying him down, and myself, with the spray bottle. She then abrasively told my two year old he needed to stay still. I considered leaving then, but I thought I'd see how my son handled it all. She continued to be abrasive with my little one, but he seemed to take it in stride. Like I said, his hair looks great, but I'm not sure if he's going to let me take him back as his words to me upon leaving were, ""no haircut momma""",negative
"I'm from out of town, been on the road for a month needed a hair cut. Read reviews on Yelp and someone recommend Kobe to cut hair. Was not disappointed . She did an excellent job. She doesn't work weekends. But if in town would go back to her!!!!",positive
"Kobe F is the best stylist I've ever had cut my hair, period. Went about 3 on a Thursday, so no wait. She asked what I wanted! (I've had stylists pick up a comb and scissors before they've said ""Hi"") My head is loaded with cowlicks - think Alfalfa but in weird spots, so I'm growing it out ( again, after a hipster barber in the Chicago 'burbs tried to make me look like I stepped out of 1939). All I asked for was a trim - and that's all I got! My beard had been cut (and not cut) in all the wrong places last time (see above) so I wanted to switch to chin straps blended with a long goatee to hide the fact that my cheeks are sliding off my cheekbones. She free-handed the clippers to shape me up. Quite simply, Kobe made me look awesome! And she recommended a beard oil that really softened my beard. I liked the haircut & beard work so well, I bought It!",positive
This place blows. A short blonde with big lips messed up my boyfriends hair so bad. He asked for some extra gel and she was a snob about it. I think maybe she forgot that were paying her for our service. Not the other way around. Learn manners.,negative
"I don't like the attitude of the people working here. We came in Saturday around 12 to get my boyfriend a hair cut. They were understandably busy and said it would be a 30-40 minute wait. No problem. He signed in and then we went to some of the surrounding stores to pass the time. When we came back 20ish minutes later and asked how long, they said 25-30 more minutes. They were pretty rude about it too. We left and decided not to come back.",negative
"Excellent option for the sports fan to stay occupied and makes the experience more enjoyable. Love the MVP - scalp massage, hot towels, shoulder massage and affordable. Better yet I don't need an appointment since time is usually the issue. However, every hair cut comes down to the person doing it. I have had some great ones here and some that they might have needed a little more mentoring. If you find a person you like that gives you consistent results that could be good. However, I do notice some turnover which is normal at other locations as well. Parking is also a pain. Go early in the morning!",positive
Its cool and all but this girl didn't really trim around my ear well at all ... and I'm not one much to complain ... :'/ Won't be back becase of this ... I did better job cutting my own hair ... sad truth .... feel some what jipped ... But nice concept. .. on there vibe ...,negative
"I have been going to this place for a few years now. Very nice staff, clean place, the options are nice. It is good to have a more masculine place to get a hair cut that is not a 100 year old barber. Only reason it is not a 5 is because there is often a wait and the parking lot is not great (especially now that Panera is taking 2 of their 4 only spots up front) To Joel: Put a shirt on man! This is the Internet!",positive
So I waited 20 minutes for a cut with only a couple people ahead of me. At the 20 min mark myself and approximate 4 or 5 others waiting for a cut . Staff was fast to tell people coming in that it's a half hour wait. They were friendly but taking too much time explaining hair products to people and trying to sell the products when they had customers waiting . I probably use them again in a pinch only because they take cards and not cash only.,negative
This is my first time here and I had Christina who is the manager for my stylist. She i awesome at engaging in conversation and such a joy to be around and compared to all the other hair places I go to this place is beyond worth it!!! Thank you guys so much for such an awesome experience. You've earned a new client!,positive
I tried this place out when I moved out here to henderson because I didn't want to travel far to go to my previous shop. First off they don't do razor fades or use a razor for anything at all. The only thing they can offer is a double zero. The ladies were nice and the VIP service is good. But they over charge for the type of haircuts they give.,negative
Just went to sports clips for the first time it was awesome head and shoulder massage Kobe was great! if you haven't been to a sports clip it's a great place to go comfortable atmosphere for a man and sports playing more could you want. Never had a hairstylist spent so much time trim in my ears neckline around my ears it's a true manicure of the the head!! Is Arnold would say I'll be back,positive
Today was my first experience having my hair cut here and I must say not only are the ladies beautiful but they do a great job. Thank you Barbie,positive

"My little sister been bringing her son's to this place for past 6 months, and now her husband is raving about one of the stylist. Good grief, can this place be really this good? Well, my hair was starting to look like drummer from a 1980's heavy metal band, and I had no time today to get to my regular stylist, so I finally took a chance with this place. Unfortunately, the person I was told to see wasn't there, but this mop top had get chopped, so gave them my name, and said it is my first time here. They were a little busy, but they told me it will be a 15 minutes wait. No biggie, because the place is set up for a guy, and all the flat screens are tuned in to ESPN. Sadly, ESPN was only talking about the Manti Teo hoax, so I ran out of there to Costco, and came back in 15 minutes. Guess what, they kept their word, and I walked right into the barber chair, and there was a couple of guys waiting on the benches. I was told to ask for kobi, but she wasn't there today, so I got a new stylist named Rogene. I was a little baffled about her name at first, but what the heck, she had a cool haircut herself, and told her to do something with that mess on my head. Since it's the wintertime, I'll usually let the stylist do what they want, because I need more hair because it cold, but at the same time I'm watching how a new stylist will do my hair. Rogene was very quick, detailed, and did one heck of a job! I didn't do the neck massage, but their tea tree oil shampoo was one of the best I tried, and the hair wax at the end was a great final touch. Did my little sister advice come through for me, yup.....I almost forgot, I get a complimentary neck shave in the next two week. Darn it, they might trap me from going back to my favorite place because of that. Great job Sport Clips.",positive
"I drive past another Sports Clips to go to this one and it's worth it. Everyone is always friendly, the lines aren't too bad and the store is always clean. Ask for Kellie. She is the best. I am sure the other girls are very good, but Kellie is awesome.",positive
"After doing the movies and the mall I had to stop and get a script which was right next door to this place so I asked my bf if he wanted to try them out. We came in and it seemed like a cool place, clean and well lit etc. I personally thought the girl that took our info was super bitchy and rude but aside that he said it was ok (which is what the 3 stars is for, had it been me...1 star for sure, I mean this chick asks us for my bf's name 3x so she can enter it into the system (after we tell her we've never been there AND asked their prices) before she will even tell us a price?! Wtf! So yeah, nothing to write home about. He also noted they are NOT a barber shop....they can't shape or line him up the way he wanted so yeah...keep your hot towel and shitty service and I will keep my money. Update: 7/27/2010 - Star rating is now at a 1 (was at a 3). So he decided to go back (it was close and he didn't want to wait to go to his regular place) and again, horrible service - this time we waited 35min before they called the guy who came in 20min after us and then we are sitting there while the ""ladies"" that work their figure out who's name they got wrong....finally he gets his cut ane he said he does NOT like that place and is never going back - period.",negative

Thank you Indigo for doing such an amazing job with our 3yr old. She was very patient and talked to my son through the whole process made him feel so comfortable so he was able to sit still the whole time. A usual 1 half hr process only took 20min with her.,positive
It was great going in to sports clips and having to listen to Jennifer snap her gum for a solid 30 minutes while in the waiting area!! (Sarcastic) So unprofessional as a hairdresser representing Sportsclips!,negative
It was a late Saturday there were two stylists on duty. Nobody at the front desk and I walked in and sat down. One yelled out to me to sign in and have a seat. The guy in the chair was getting a VIP so I imagine they couldnt stop to assist a new customer. After 25 mins (they must of been a really special VIP) I was seated told them what I wanted. They said they understood and started quickly. Im no stylist but it felt like they were hurrying. My hair looked like it as well. When she finally stopped. I said thank you but could we actually try this again and slow down the scissors as they arent evenly trimming the hair. She changed scissors and took some more off at a good slow pace and my hair turned out fairly good. I know we are out west and our sporting options are limited in the evening but every TV had NASCAR. If they had sprung for a sports package I was listening to Baseball on my phone in the Lobby and would have prefered to watch that than the roundie rounders. I like this franchise in Omaha but not a good overall experience here in Vegas.,negative
"This is my first time to this Sport Clips, and let me tell you for a $22 it is top notch, $22 gets you a cut, shampoo and condition, steam towel for your face and a light neck massage, it was my first time so for the basic haircut i originally wanted, i got the M.V.P. which is what its called for free. And also it is more guy oriented with a big tv in the waiting area and tv in the cutting room as well.",positive
"I walked in and no one was there; rather, she was off outside and came in angry. It was a Saturday, so there was plenty of college games on; the only good thing in a sea of bad times. My stylist just sort of glared at me when I said I needed a quarter-inch trim, then proceeded to work in silence while I watched a Florida game. Which was good. I then ended up looking like a balding six-year-old. Not good. I paid my $17 (she sold the MVP in the way a person would try to advertise cholera, I avoided it) and got out. At least my hair's regrowing...",negative
"This is more of a 3.5 star rating but I'll boost it to 4 since I'm in a good mood. Despite popular belief(probably due to the 5 year old photo), I actually do cut my hair occasionally (whenever I don't buzzcut it). The problem with me is that I am picky when it comes to finding a good hair salon since I visit them so infrequently. I always irk at the thought of going to the same ole Supercuts on rainbow near Cheyanne and having to wait 20-40 minutes every single time I go there (twice in over a year) so I took it upon myself to shell out about $20 for a haircut and figured Sports Clips was decent enough, especially since if I was to wait 20 minutes before I could get my hair cut, I might as well be watching sports as opposed to pretending to be busy texting on my cell phone in public if I were at some other hair salon. Either way I arrive at Sport Clips with a 3-5 minute wait as the hairdresser was finishing up a patient and I was soon getting my hair worked on. Normally my hair when grown is a warzone and extremely uneven, I told the hairdresser to trim up the sides and back with a blend on the top. She did a pretty good job. And as a bonus for going their for the first time, they gave me the MVP treatment for free. It's certainly nothing like a VIP treatment at some other establishments out in Las Vegas, but I really do appreciate the hot towel over the head, nice neck rub/massage/shampoo (normally $5 extra). When it was all said and done I was pretty much looked the the aspiring wannabe hipster I set out to be. Overall, I had a decent experience, mid-day Saturday visit with no wait, paid about $20 for a pretty good haircut, no complaints, decently solid in my opinion.",positive
"Got a flyer in the mail for this place, and heard about it from a friend, too. It just opened a month ago, so I thought I'd give it a try with their coupon. Normal haircut is usually $17, MVP haircut (more on this later) is $22. My coupon was $12 for an MVP cut, so definitely a price break from the $39 I pay at American Male across the street. No appointments was a like and a dislike. Liked being spontaneous and going in when I had time, but didn't like waiting. Lots of sports on TV, which is their thing but isn't mine. Definitely not as fancy as American Male or other salons, but good for the price. MVP haircut included a hot towel, massaging chair and scalp massage. It was all OK, but nothing amazing. It made me miss the treatment I'm used to across the street. Sheesh, I think American Male has ruined me for every other hair salon. I'll probably end up spending the extra bucks. But if you want to save money, Sport Clips is perfectly acceptable. Think of it as a bit higher end Supercuts without quite going to salon prices.",negative

"SportClips Haircuts: Guys watch sports! Guys get haircuts! What a an experience! SportClips offers inexpensive men's haircuts with options! Just $16 for a men's haircut and wash AFTER (great so you don't have little hairs everywhere for the rest of the day). You also have the option of doing a shoulder massage - heaven! Meanwhile, you are in a cool place with sports decor everywhere, and TVs playing the sports you like. The employees definitely know sports, and in my case, Deana was nice, friendly, and gave me the perfect cut. This place reminds me of the old-style barbers of the 1940s & 50s, who cut your hair while you and the other guys talk about guy things - like sports! In this day and age, there are plenty of salons for women. Why do guys need to sit there and get their haircut in an atmosphere they feel uncomfortable in? This is a modern-style, friendly, sporty place with great services and low prices! Three Madison locations: Corner of PD & Verona Rd, Deming Way in Middleton, and Gammon Rd near Woodman's. I'll definitely be coming back (after all, I got a coupon for $5 off my next haircut, $4 off the following one, and so on, down to $2, which I believe all new clients get)!",positive
"This is a professional hairstylist. His style resembles slightly of an asian hairstyle, and although I'm caucasian, I get even more than I want.

I'm a frequent client.",positive
"Haircuts have always been a bother for me. I can never find a stylist that I like but I can confidently say I am happy with my hair cut. Taro was very personable and gave me a lot of attention. I suppose my only con is price, the price was very reasonable but slightly higher than other asian hair salons in the area.",positive
"Taro is probably one of the most experienced hair stylist that I've ever met. I brought a couple of pictures with me to show him the styles that possibly suits me. And then we had a discussion about what I actually wants. He gave me a little bit advice in here and there, and as a result we came up with a new hairstyle that I like a lot. His service exceeds my expectation. my suggestion: as a reference, you can bring the pictures and show him the style that you want. but, his advice is definitely something that deserve a consideration too.",positive
"I have been trying to find a good place to get a haircut in Toronto for a long time. I was never satisfied with my haircut before coming to Studio T.

I have my hair done by Kame and he is amazing, he is always on time so I never have to wait. He cuts my hair diligently and is very detailed.",positive
"I would give this place a 4 star review based on this guy who did my hair. His name is Masa and he is very friendly and pays attention to detail. I got my hair colored here and I really liked the color. In between when he washed my hair, he have me a head massage which was much appreciated!! However I came back with my mom and sister who also wanted to get their hair colored. My sisters hair turned out fine because Masa dealt with her, but my moms hair turned out HORRIBLE. Don't let the assistant touch your hair!!! She is this stumpy Japanese girl with long blonde hair who speaks no English at all. She made my moms hair 3 different colors. It was like gradation! I don't remember asking for a tie-dye color style for her hair. She doesn't speak English AND is completely rude cause she didn't even apologize. Don't ever let her touch your hair. She is completely useless and stupid. Due to this incident, we had to stay extra 2 hours....SO RIDICULOUS!!!!! Because of her I give this place 1 star.",negative
"Taro is a very talented hair stylist. I've been going to him for around 4 years now, and even after I've moved to NYC, I still go back to him to get my hair cut! He is attentive and a bit of a perfectionist. His suggestions as to what kind of hairstyle fits my face have never disappointed me. From your basic cut and wash to the elaborate Japanese thermal hair straightening, he does it all and he does it well. 5 stars for extremely reasonable prices and excellent service.",positive

Being that it's cheaper to get done in Oregon rather than flying back, I decided to spread my wings (after I expressed my fear :)). They did an amazing job and made me feel right at home. Priced extremely well for the results, love my hair! Would recommend to anyone!",positive
As a busy working mom I can certainly appreciate the convenience of having all of my services done in one place from tanning to nails to best haircut ever. And great prices the Sunfire seems to be my great find of the year. The tanning beds are sizzling hot. Haven't tried the spray tanning yet but look forward to it. And the specials can't be beat. Renee did my nails exactly as I wanted and that was refreshing. (I tend to be picky) But by far my most favorite aspect of the salon is Heidi my new stylist. Once I sat in her chair purly by coincidence since I was a walk-in the first time I felt she really listened to what I wanted and did her best to achieve that perfect haircut and what do you know I love it. Since then I've become a loyal client even bring in my son who used to be terified of haircuts and now will only allow Heidi to cut his hair. Even let her use clippers this time. And that's huge for the little guy. So ladies and gents go check them out you won't regret it. Promise,positive
Heidi cut my daughter hair in a perfect A-line!!!!! Her hair is soooooo cute!!!!! Heidi cares about the quality of her work.....she really took her time and made sure it was perfect.....thank you Heidi......we wont go anywhere else!!!!!,positive
"I'm sure that if I had a chance to even get a service done here, that I'd be decently satisfied, but the issue is that it seems they never have anyone on schedule that does what you need done. Maybe it's bad luck on my part, but after 5 attempts for different services over the past 6 or 7 months, it's seeming less and less likely that it's bad luck or bad timing. They run plenty of specials, but when you try to take advantage of those specials, they can't provide you with the services advertised. For a while they had $10 haircuts on Mondays, but for some reason, no matter what time it was on a Monday, no one working there could sit my brother down and give him a simple haircut. Now that may have been an anomaly, a one time deal, so we tried the next two weeks, and had the same result. In fact, the last time we tried for him they told us to try to make an appointment on a separate day. (As in not a Monday when it would only cost $10). We ended up just going into medford to get his hair cut for cheaper and as a walk in. My dad tried as well a bit afterwards, and same deal there, not one of the three girls in there knew how to operate a clipper and do a simple hair cut. Those were the first 4 attempts. The fifth (and likely the final time, no matter how close and ""convenient"" they may seem, I don't think I or any one of my family members will try again) was today. I scheduled a nail appointment earlier this week, and less than 2 hours before I was scheduled to go in, I got a call telling me that my girl had a family emergency and she asked me to reschedule. Regardless of her family emergency or not, how is it possible to only have one girl on schedule that can do nails? Especially seeing as they currently have a coupon in circulation advertising a free express manicure or $10 off of a full set of nails. They have that coupon out and only have one girl who knows how to do nails? They usually seem to have 2-4 girls sitting around in there, they have free time to go to restaurants in this complex, order food, sit around for around an hour, but they have NOT had the time or the people to give us the services advertised any of the 5 times we've tried in the past 6 or 7 months? Maybe my opinion of them will change if I get a chance to actually step in there to get my nails done this week, and if my appointment the day after tomorow isn't cancelled again, but so far it's not looking good. It's so much easier to go all the way into medford to get what you need, than it is to play their game and hope that you get lucky and actually get what you need done.",negative
"The inside is outdated, old. Brandy was nice but pushy about me dying my hair after I said No several times. I got home and found out I had lots of really short hairs on the side of my head that I didn't ask for and it is taking forever to grow back. It was only $30 for a haircut and style which is a great price though. But I won't return, I have had better haircuts elsewhere for the same price.",negative
This Supercuts does a great job with color and haircuts. I have been getting my hair colored here for the last several months and it always turns out great! And at such a great price. I have never had a bad haircut and I have had several different stylists. My son is very picky about who cuts his hair and he has never had a bad haircut. The stylists are super friendly and very helpful when I am trying to find the right product for my current hairstyle. I will always come back here to have my hair done. Thanks Supercuts.,positive
"This place depending who you get is awful the hairdresser I had used to cut sheeps in Idaho I think She really screwed up my hair, my general conclusion is I would not go to Supercuts for anything!!",negative
"Older lady with the dark hair super mean, huge attitude. To be fair, I walked in at 4:35 when they close at 5 and I had an appointment at 3:40 so I was super late but still, I apologized and asked if it was too late she could've easily said yes come back tomorrow and I would've walked out the door totally fine and came back the following day. But instead she said no it's fine and then just started tearing my hair out with a comb angrily, I could see her making a face and rolling her eyes at me in the mirror as I Grimaced in pain so I said no thanks and ran out the door . I work in the service Industry as well and I would never treat anyone so rudely. I will never go back here again that's for sure thanks for making me feel so unwelcome and for tearing out my hair.",negative
"They give good haircuts, but dont get waxed, they really dont know what they doing in this area, unfriendly service. The worst of the worst of the super cuts",negative
"Kimmy and the staff couldn't be any nicer or more accommodating. No appointment needed, but call.ahead and get your name in, especially if you have a specific person to see. When Kim isn't available, ask for Lori.",positive
"South east corner of the intersection in the Albertsons shopping area. I've been going there for years, it's a great shop.",positive
"I got a shellac manicure done here and I'm pretty disappointed. I saw chips less than a week after it was done, and the polish looks streaky and discoloured. My tech was also quite rude and spent more time trimming my cuticles than on the nails themselves. Overall this was not a great experience and I definitely won't be going back.",negative
"I wonder how people run their business!! A lady with an attitude?!! I was picking colors and not sure between two, impatiently she said: Is it that hard?!!!!! Then while she was polishing my nails and I was looking!!! She said: RELAX?!!""!!! Seriously?! who would treat a customer like that? I would never go back!",negative
"This place is extremely small (can only take like 3 mani and pedis at a time.) They were great except be careful when selecting an opaque white/cream. Will return for mani/pedi if i choose a diff color. The lady gave me streaks like crazy. ugh. Also got a Brazilian and eyebrow&upper lip. My upper lip broke out a day later and the line I required for the Brazilian looked like a Hitler 'stash (short instead of medium length and thinner)! lol with more vocal input from me it could have been better. My whole bottom was super cleaned off! I would return for the braz but not the face waxing! All in all: cheap, friendly and convenient location. ( right behind Starbucks.) Will return. edit.. just went this morning for another wax. $30 and took no more than 15 min long and I didn't have to wait to go in. LOVED the way she waxed. When I groaned or yelped in pain she just held down the area until the pain subsided or blew on the area. She quickly and professionally wiped aloe vera on the waxed areas. Her English isn't the best so if you have a special request (Brazilian w a ""landing strip"") just make sure you're clear:) Immediately recommended a friend so if you are worried about feeling awkward or in unnecessary pain, THIS is where to go!!",positive
"Three words: cheap. brow. waxing. I always run in here to get my brows waxed. For $8, it's the cheapest price I have found in my area; I have heard Brampton has a lot of salons that charge $2, $3, but after including gas I would be spending like $50 for a brow wax. You don't need to make an appointment and you'll be in and out within 10 minutes.",positive
"I get shellac done here and they are amazing! It's super cheap, fast and the staff is really friendly. I've been to other more expensive places in the area and the quality just doesn't compare.",positive
"Vanessa was so friendly. She researched the haircut I wanted before I got it. She stayed in on her day off to take care of my service. Not only is she a fabulous person but I love my hair! Thanks, Vanessa!",positive
"I wandered in to this salon because the yelp ratings were great. Stylist Vanessa was able to accommodate my request for wash and cut. I have naturally curly hair and wanted to maximise the natural curl for an easy care short style. I was very pleased overall. Terry and Vanessa were both very friendly. I also enjoyed conversation with several other customers there during my visit. It is a small salon, and you must go looking for it. It is on the second floor of El Cortez casino hotel, and you would never find it walking by. Thank you to the hotel staff who told me to take the elevators by the hotel /casino gift shop to the second floor. It was worth looking for.",positive
My friend and I wanted to do something fun with our hair for the Life is Beautiful festival. We found this place and Loretta did our braids. We love it! I feel beautiful and ready to dance all weekend! Thank you!,positive
Terry is great. She's super cute and her shop has a beautiful Old Vegas charm. She did my bridemaid and I's hair for my ceremony. I gave her full artistic license and she ended up doing this pin up-bouffant updo with sparkles. It was exactly what I wanted without even knowing it.,positive
"Vanessa is the reason I come here. Shes a real pro with a relaxed demeanor. I give her four stars. Terry on the other hand, while skilled with her scissors needs to keep the politics out of the workplace.I want my hair trimmed. Not to hear pro Trump banter.",negative
Great customer service the ladies made you feel very comfortable. Went to get our hair done for a wedding - had a bridal updo and a blowout done.. thank you for making us pretty !!!,positive
"My mom needed a last minute updo for her 50th anniversary wedding renewal ceremony. The owner, Terry got her in and did such an amazing job. Exactly what my mom wanted and then some. I can't say enough good things about the experience. Absolutely made my moms day. Thank you, thank you!!!!",positive
We visited Terry Rae's on Tuesday 9/6. Very nice salon tucked away in the El Cortez Casino. Very friendly staff and comfortable place. Extremely satisfied with the services provided. Will return for another hair coloring next time in Vegas. Thank you.,positive
Uptown hair and downtown prices! Terry has done my hair for more than 20 years! She is the best colorist and stylist around. She is a wonderful person and her retro shop is always fun. Love my hair! I always get so many complements on how healthy it looks and the outstanding color. Check her out!,positive
"I was in Vegas for my 20th high school reunion and Terry very graciously accommodated me at the last minute for a mani/pedi. She was kind, professional and did a fantastic job! Her salon is clean and professional. She is Vegas native, like myself, so it was a bonus to swap stories of our hometown.",positive
Me and my husband were married there in Vegas on Aug 25th. We stayed at the El Cortez and Terry from the hair salon there gave me a very beautiful hair style. My husband loved it also! She did such a great job and she also recommended some places for me and my husband to go while we were there.,positive
"The best cut and colour EVAHHHH! I have been going to this salon since September. To begin they have an amazing online booking system. You pick your stylist and service(s) and time/ date and they slot you in. They are alos clear on pricing too. They remind you and confirm straight to your phone. I love it! Secondly, I am middle aged and I don't want a frumpy cut so I like to go to a studio that is current and modern. Often I feel out of place in more modern settings but this is not the case at Texture. 100% comfort for every guest who comes in. Thirdly, they are professionals. I have just been cutting my hair short for the last 8 months. I came in on Saturday and I was greeted by my amazing stylist Emilie. I had grown out my colour and was trying to own my grey but needed a change. I totally trusted her and now I have an amazing lavender pixie. I have never looked so beautiful. I thought using the ""fun"" colours would age me but instead I look 20 years younger. She never pushed and just knew what to do... and it looks amazing... like I have naturally violet hair... I have never been so happy with my hair in years. I have in the last 48 hours given out all the cards I took with me. I am stopped to say how great my hair is and I just am thrilled there are good salons like this exist.",positive
"Best haircut of my life. I still can't get over what a great job Emelie did! She's so good at her job, it's obvious she was meant to cut hair. I'll definitely be going back again!",positive
Had my hair cut by Ashley today and she did an awesome job! She was very attentive and listened to my needs and took what I requested and tailored it to my hair texture. She suggested thinning out my hair which I haven't done in a while and I couldn't be more thankful. I have super thick hair so it moves so much better now that it's not so weighed down. She's a sweetheart and you can truly see that she not only knows what she's doing but that she's also passionate about doing it.,positive
"I cannot say enough amazing things about Jessica. She is so super talented. THE boss when it comes to colour art! I found my forever hairstylist. Hands down. She took me from drab to tres chic. I have a perfect colour melt, beautiful style & healthier hair. Being on multiple harsh medications that really effect my hair, she was able to work with my hair and get the right red colours to shine through. She was very detailed on what the process would be before beginning, what products she used, gave tips on maintenance aftercare, came in below my budget and made sure I was completely satisfied with everything before walking out the door. She truly loves what she does and it shows through in her work. She is easy to talk to and listens to exactly what the client wants. Even better is I can look forward to an affordable maintenance plan so I can keep up this new great look that matches my personality. Thank you Jessica for reviving my hair and me!! I cannot recommend Jessica enough. You're search for a colourist stops here!!",positive
"Updated: Honestly, Allison, I think your justifications are odd. I came in to get a few silver highlights put into my bangs. If you couldn't do it, you should have said so. Instead I got yellow and dark brown bumble bee highlights to the middle of my head that don't match my natural hair at all. Plus, now I've got regrowth And yes, when I calculated what i paid to your salon, i did include the generous tips i left. How you could let me leave looking the way I did (which i couldn't tell because of the lighting in your salon) is beyond me. If anyone wants to see the outcome of your work, I've uploaded the photos to my profile - so take a look. And yes, in my many years of going to hair salons, I've posted three bad reviews and yours is one. Honestly, you're the absolute worst. You should feel embarrassed but, clearly, that's not in your repertoire. ......... After growing out my grey hair for three years, while keeping it long, I decided I'd put a few DIY highlights at the front of my bangs, where the hair is still pretty dark. Dumb idea. I went for a fix, but the tone was still off, so I called Texture, where there's a really great colourist who knows how to work with grey. She wasn't available, and I was heading into two weeks of travel and client presentations, so I asked if there was anyone else there experienced at matching grey hair. I was told that Allison, the owner, was. I paid $170 for silver highlights in my bangs. Unfortunately, Allison made a mess of it, giving me big yellow streaks that didn't match my hair at all, then, as an initial attempt to correct the problem, extending it all about three inches back into my natural hair. The result was terrible, dwarfing the issue I started with. The only solution at that point was to put a demi colour on the whole thing to try and get rid of the now very large section of yellowed hair and create some semblance of a unified colour. I understand that mistakes happen. Such is life. But Allison then charged me an additional $75 for the 'fix', bringing me up to $250 for my botched bangs (not to mention the hours i spent at the salon), which still don't match. I was also told that i would now need to tone this big front section of hair, now, every few weeks to keep the yellow at bay, until it grows out - in about a year or so. A very disappointing outcome and customer service experience, all round.",negative
"I absolutely recommend this salon! I saw Dasha and I could not ask for a better experience. She listened to my concerns (I recently had a cut at another salon / it literally looked like I had 3 separate hair cuts that did not blend together....) and I did not want to lose too much length. Dasha took the time to explain options and when all was said and done, I left the salon feeling great about my new cut. She even took the time to show me some different styling options! I will definitely be going back!!!",positive
Fantastic experience! Just moved to the city a little while ago and was dreading finding a new stylist. I easily booked an appointment online after reading good reviews here on Yelp. Booked with Allison and had a great experience. Showed her some pictures of where I wanted to go in terms of a new look. She totally got it and was super positive. Even though I'm a guy my hair can be a disaster in the wrong hands and I can tell this is an excellent cut already. I'll be back. Highly recommended!,positive
"I gave Textür a try because I read great reviews about it online. I've now had my hair cut there twice (by Allison) and have been very happy both times. I was inspired by their Instagram feed to ask for an undershave under my usual bob and Allison made a nice design in the shaven hair. When I went back for bang trims/undershave cleanups, she continued to switch it up with great designs. She also recommended underlayering for my thick hair, and I loved it! The way she cuts my hair, I am actually able to replicate the result at home with a hair straightener, which never seems to be the case with other stylists. Plus, there's an adorable little doggy in the studio named Burger. Needless to say, I'll be going back! *Same review posted on Google.",positive
"New to Toronto. I'm very picky about getting my hair cut. Dasha did an excellent job getting an idea of what I wanted and I couldn't be happier with the results. Welcoming and friendly staff, non-pretentious, good tunes playing on the radio, tea or coffee if you want it while you wait, and an awesome little dog named Burger who will sit in your lap if you're cool with it. I'll be back at Textur for my next cut and I suggest you do the same, you won't be disappointed.",positive
"Went in for a haircut, The experience started off alright, I explained what I wanted and she said she could handle that. When she washed my hair she didn't ask about pressure or temperature, and I was a bit taken aback when I told her I was getting over a cold and she told me not to breath on her. She didn't place a towel over my shoulders so my shirt got soaked while she was cutting. She did not add layers to my curly hair so I've ended up with a strange triangle shape which, a few people have pointed out, is massively uneven one side to the other. Someone said it looks like I did it myself. when she was done she handed me a mirror to look at it, but didn't ask how I felt abut the length. I called to see what could be done (ive never called to complain anout something before) but no one called back. I'm disappointed as I had a great experience with another stylist previously. I live and work in the area and I will not be recommending this place.",negative
"Let's be real, finding a new hairdresser can be a daunting experience. You get recommendations, but you never really know if you'll leave happy until you go and try them out. In my personal experience, I have been disappointed pretty much every single time I tried somewhere new... until I found Dasha at Textur. Admittedly, I'm not the easiest client and I like to switch up my style pretty regularly. Having said that, I have had appointments when I have gone in with specific photos of what I want done, and appointments when I have left it entirely up to her to decide what to do with my hair. In either scenario, I am always leaving with a huge smile on my face and, as cheesy as this may sound, feeling like a new person. And it's not just me, both my wife (who also sees Dasha) and I have had complete strangers complimenting our hair and asking where we got it done. The entire team at Textur is equally fantastic. I am greeted with a smile and nothing but positive vibes every time I visit. I'm always made to feel welcomed and comfortable by literally everyone I interact with here (including their famous pooch, Burger). I cannot say enough about Dasha and Textur, and no Yelp review will be able to accurately describe how you will feel walking out of this place, finally being truly satisfied with your hair. Go check them out to understand what I'm talking about. I promise you, you will not be disappointed.",positive
"I was trekking back to the suburbs for the last three years since I've moved down into the city, for a haircut that I could trust and afford. Finally, a friend recommended Alison @ Textur and I haven't had to head north of the 401 since. Headsup, Burger runs the place, no matter what anyone else says.",positive
Love my colour and cut by Trish! I wanted a colour change (hadn't done it in years) and she gave a great consultation on what would work for me. I've received numerous compliments on my hair. Thanks Trish! The salon has a great vibe and everyone is super friendly. Totally recommend this place!,positive
"Wanted to make a change in stylists, and so glad that I took a chance here. Jessica gave me exactly what I wanted and talked about a game plan to slowly grow out my hair with the utmost enthusiasm. Can't wait to go back.",positive
Had my haircut today by Tiffany!!!!!! It was absolutely amazing! She is amazing she really listened to my concerns and needs. Im extremely picky and can never find the perfect cut for my face shape she really took her time and give me the perfect cut plus showed me how to style and take care of my hair. Just an amazing experience at the salon.,positive
Great salon in Leslieville. Allison cut my hair and gave me exactly what I wanted. I was able to get in same day (thankfully!) and the price was fantastic.,positive
"Fantastic personal service in a great environment from passionate hair experts. My only complaint is price. $40 for a men's cut is definitely on the high side. Then again, they're right around the corner and it's hard to put a price on convenience :-)",positive
Walked in to Thairapy and was told they do not accept walk ins. I asked if i could schedule an appointment with Mimi because I was referred to her by a friend. The girl at the front desk said that she was booked all month long and that she would give Mimi my number and they would get back to me. It has been over a week and I have heard nothing. I am willing to spend good money on my hair with the right stylist and have heard and seen nothing but great things as far as Mimi's work. This absolutely leaves a bad taste in my mouth. It seems like the front desk is not organized. I do not understand why they would need to call me back just to schedule an appointment for next month.,negative
"Blush Salon is no more, but lucky for me and the other thick haired girls of the west Valley, its best parts have been reincarnated in a fresh new salon called Thairapy. Located just a mile or so up the road at Wigwam and Indian School, the new space is roomier, has better parking, and is just steps away from several tasty lunch options if you want to make a day of it. I am completely enamored with my stylist, Shamika, who is the divine combination of hair genius, gorgeous tall model, and wicked funny honest. She has big dreams and I have full confidence that she will nail them all. Her hands are magic on my hair, which in its natural state is grey, heavy, flat and boring. Before my head gave up on making brown hair, Shamika colored it with amazing expertise: blond, brown, caramel, you name it. Once I went fully grey and silver, she encouraged me to embrace that natural beauty. I'm so glad I listened. Her cuts are equally brilliant. She's taken me super short, she's twirled me into shoulder length sexy waves, and she's currently got me in an a-line bob for summer. No matter what, I leave looking good and feeling empowered. Thairapy clients are welcomed by Alexis, who is charming and adept at keeping everyone happy. They offer beverages and snacks bits from a bakery just across the parking lot, and plenty of stylish and comfy seating if you arrive early. While I truly adore Shamika (also known as Mimi) the talent in this salon is all top notch. When I needed an urgent cut on a fully booked Shamika day, she referred a colleague named Danielle who snipped my messy strands into a perfect chic bob. It is truly an indulgence to put myself in a Thairapy chair. My haircuts are $45, and well worth it.",positive
Haircut was great. Jewelz listened to what I wanted and did a great job with my hair. A little pricier than most but I was happy with the end result. As a first time customer I received a 20% discount which was really nice.,positive
"This salon is classy and so professional. Shamika is my go to stylist. She is AMAZING at blonde highlights and bayalage. She listens to me as a client and executes exactly what you're looking for. I would 100% recommend her to anyone looking for a personable & professional hairstylist. She is honest, genuine, and cares about her clients.",positive
YYyyaaaassss!!!! I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS SALON! I had my appointment with Melissa and she did your girl awesome. Went in for color and not just any color but PURPLE of all colors and it came out fabulous!! Many salons told me it couldn't be done but she did. I am highly satisfied with the results. Plus the whole staff complimented me and were super nice!! Can't wait for my next appointment!,positive
Love everything about this new salon. Just visited today for a cut and full highlight/color. Melissa is such a gem and does such a fantastic job with my stubborn hair. I actually drive all the way from south Chandler to see her because she is THAT good. Thairapy Salon is so classy inside. You can tell that the ladies take extreme pride in their services. You won't be disappointed.,positive
"I'll follow Melissa anywhere! She has an amazing way with my frizzy, brittle hair. I love the new salon. It's well decorated and classy, there is easy parking, and the whole staff is amazing. I highly recommend Thairapy Salon!",positive
"The salon is beautifully decorated. The hair stations are clean and well spaced. But the stylists are what make this salon great! Jewlz is my girl and I have followed her to 3 salons now - she is so knowledgable about hair. She listens to what I would like but also makes suggestions on what she thinks could be best - I trust her opinion, she is the professional after all! She also cuts my 8 yr old daughter's hair and she's so sweet when she works with her. Recently, we both went in for a cut and I had told my daughter we didn't have time for Ms. Jewlz to curl her hair. My daughter went first and was waiting for me to be finished when Jewlz started to curl my hair with the flat iron - just some each beauty waves. Well my daughter says ""hey! no fair!"" and kinda smiles and pouts at the same time. Watching this happen, Nicolette, the stylist next to Jewlz, takes my daughter to her chair and puts some curls in her hair while I was finishing up - my daughter left there BEAMING and GIGGLING! She was elated! It was so very sweet of Nicolette! That story is what THairapy Salon is all about - making every client feel beautiful when they leave the salon! If you are not thrilled with your current stylist - give Therapy a chance! You will not be disappointed!",positive
"This salon is filled with incredibly talented stylists! Nicolette is amazing, she's passionate about what she does and it shows in her work. Not only does she do hair magic, she's also super down to earth and will help you have realistic exceptions of what your hair will look like. She has done my hair every color I have asked (a lot of colors) and she's always made me look and feel beautiful!!",positive
"Gorgeous salon filled with the sweetest, most talented hair stylists. Danielle has been making me feel beautiful for 11+ years now, she is a must for your hair goals! #hippiehairchick",positive
The space is beautiful! Love the location and Danielle does an amazing job. I absolutely love my highlights! If you are looking for a professional salon and amazing and experienced stylists (ahem Danielle especially!!!) tryvour Thairapy!!!,positive
"I've been going to the big chain stores to get my hair cut for maybe 10 years, this is the first local barbershop/salon that I've been to in a while. First and foremost, when you walk in, the place just screams comfort. It's not a very big place, but you feel immediately welcome. The stylist that cut my hair was inviting and helped me decide on what to do. It's not as cheap as those big stores but you get a detailed cut that isn't rushed. I say if you're looking for a good locally owned shop stop in.",positive
"I've never really cared about my hair... I usually just walk into whatever the closest barber is and tell them to do their best, and am generally pretty happy with the results. This time around, I decided I'd actually proactively look for a well-rated salon, and I'm so so happy I found this place! Melissa was super super patient, and obviously knew her craft really well. She took the time to help me choose a cut I'd be happy with (quite the feat) as well as came up with a morning styling regimen that fit my needs and showed me how to style my hair. Couldn't be happier with the cut or the service, and I know I'll be coming here regularly for haircuts from now on. This is one of those world-class small business gems. [Note: They've been having some problems with their phone system, so don't be discouraged if you have problems calling them... they're definitely open!]",positive
Stopped in to get my teen boys haircuts before Christmas parties. Owner Melissa was super nice and did a great job. We will be back!,positive
"Was in town on business and needed a quick cut. I got in without a wait and Britney did A pretty good job considering it was her first time cutting my hair. It's a no frills place and if you are a simple guy with an easy cut, I bet it's perfect for you and fairly priced.",positive
Guys just go there I am sure you are going to get satisfied. Guys don't explain too much what they want it's ok she will grab your ideas and will know what you want. And I should say it is like ordering a coffee it's fast. I can keep on praising these pretty ladies. I got a hair cut from Britney .going there is worth your money .,positive
"I've got curly hair that I like to keep longer and style loosely but still need to look trimmed enough to pass for professional. I have gone to a half dozen shops over the last 4 years that say they specialize in men's hair, described what I wanted, worked with them over a couple sessions to give them a chance to figure things out, and never come away feeling like I got my money's worth. I did the same for Melissa and her first response was ""I don't know what the hell is wrong with those other people"" and she got to work. Hands down the best haircut I've had in years. Not only that, but since I was passing through town for work, she took time to describe what she did so I could explain it to someone else down the road. So if you're looking for a new spot, Melissa is definitely worth a visit. For me, if I lived in this city this would be the only place I'd need to go.",positive
"I usually do not pay more than $10 for a haircut, but since I moved to this area I was unable to find a quality haircut in my original budget. However, I tried out the Man Cave Salon and I was very impressed. I finally got a good haircut! Melissa was very friendly and engaging. She is also a very good barber and cut my hair exactly as I wanted it. Facility was clean. Not the biggest place and I would imagine it gets busy (it wasn't the day I went) but you can make an appointment. Highly recommended.",positive
"I recently moved from Akron to Tallmadge and was looking for a local convenient spot to get my hair cut. I have had three cuts at The Man Cave and will be a regular there now. When I read Brian's review, I felt compelled to come in and give my own, especially due to one statement that I thought might keep people away and is completely out of sync with my three visits. Brian is a regular reviewer on Yelp. Maybe he will reconsider and edit. Maybe just a bad day? First and foremost, I think it is important that if we are going to review someplace, we review the product. You know, if I am looking for a restaurant, I want to know how the food is. I am a 50 year old business man. As a veteran of the military, I never really changed my cut much over the years. I part on the side, and I like a very short, clean cut look. I am typically loyal to a local barber. For the first time in a long time, I have received compliments on my hair after Melissa cut it. Multiple compliments. Seriously, my look is similar, but my hair looks sharper and it has probably been 30 years since anyone even noticed it. It is a great cut and I will certainly send people there, including my father when he is in town. For the record, my father is 72, a retired business executive, and he isn't looking for ""attitude,"" nor am I. That brings me to the points I would like to politely rebut, so that you at least feel comfortable giving it a try. The review in question states it is a bit expensive for a ""humble cut."" I would say it is a humble price for a professional cut. The price is less than 20 bucks. It cost about the same as a fast food trip for two. It is very expensive to keep a small business running these days. Priced health insurance lately? Rent? Even if you go to a chain, you are going to pay this in many cases. My wife pays anywhere from 3 to 5 times this amount. You can find cheaper barbers. As I have stated, I am sticking with this place for the foreseeable future. I am a value buyer. I look for ""bang for the buck."" The review in question states that there are two ""distractions."" One of those is an attractive, ""cool"" person cutting your hair. Um... Why does the persons appearance have anything to do with the product? I am really scratching my head over this one. If you are insecure, yeah, you can go to another place I guess. I didn't give it a thought. She can weigh a hundred pounds, or 250 pounds, as long as I walk away with the same quality hair cut. Now for the complete disconnect. The other reviewer states that the haircut is served up with attitude. What!? Just disregard that. That is so far from reality that I can only guess that it either was tied to the other issue with the stylists looks, or maybe he just had a bad day, at worst a misunderstanding. I have waited in there with every seat full, half of them with guys like me, half with kids with cool young cuts. The owner walked over and poured us each a cup of coffee if we wanted one. Politely and professionally. She always shows concern for the length of your wait and gives you updates. The salon has a consultative approach. You will be asked some polite, concise questions to insure you get the cut you want. The communication is very good. I also learned about new hair products (who knew that styling gel was so 1980's). Melissa recommended a product that works fantastic on my hair and keeps it in place. It is similar to going to a good establishment to buy a suit. They consult with you and make you look better. I need all the help I can get. Give it a try. Great customer service and work ethic. Great hair cut.",positive
"I had been looking for a place to get my hair cut as my previous barber closed her shop. I wanted someplace close to home (Stow) but I was willing to drive to find a shop I felt comfortable at. Man Cave is that type of place. Melissa took my appointment on short notice and when I first walked in they have a big chalkboard with a quote on it from Bob Feller (one of my all-time favorite Indians) and a chalk drawing of Chief Wahoo, I really liked this ambiance. Melissa is a good barber/stylist, I explained what I wanted and she completed the cut perfectly. I like to have hair rinsed after the cut and it was no problem. She made some good recommendations on product and showed me the difference between different types. I have been back twice since then and this is now my regular hair shop.",positive
"I, like a growing percentage of men, put effort in their appearance so that they make a good impression before even saying hello. Melissa gets that. Not only does she take care in making sure that you understand how what you are asking for is going to actually look on you, she explains variations and options to make your future style your own. I'll admit, I was wary when I first left, not sure if how it was cut that day was how I wanted it. But I did exactly what she said, and let it grow a few days, and I can't even count all the compliments I've gotten since. I cannot speak highly enough of Melissa and the pride she takes in her work. I would absolutely wait until the next time I visit Kent, just so I could go back to her. A. Motherf#cking. Plus.",positive
"This place solved my problem of never knowing the place to go for a good haircut. Melissa is the owner, and she is extremely nice, and also fantastic at cutting hair. I will not go anywhere else. You will not get a $10 haircut in price or quality. However, you get what you pay for, and that is why I keep going back -- and will not go anywhere else. You actually get to know your hairdresser, and Melissa knows her stuff. 5*'s",positive
"My first time at The Office Salon and I was matched with the most talented, beautiful Sarah. Unsure about what exactly to do with my hair, Sarah envisioned the perfect color and cut - and easily explained the techniques she would use. Sarah is meticulous and has unbelievable creativity. She literally transformed my hair and I have never been happier with it. Sarah is an expert in her field, and has this amazing warm, positive energy! Also, the salon's owner and stylist - Kevin, and stylists -Max and Matt - have the best sense of humor, energy, and skill. This salon is a little family of their own. You're not going to find another environment like this one Never looking for another place to go.",positive
"Wonderful salon. I just moved from Los Angeles and needed to find a new salon in Phoenix. I love the Davanes products that I have been using. I started my search looking for salons that used these products. Then I narrowed it to the one with the best reviews. That was the Office Salon. To say I do not my around Phoenix is being generous. This salon is not anyway near where I live. However, Sara is so good I made two more appointments and I will keep coming back. This salon is incredible. Glad I found it.",positive
"Sara was so awesome. Super sweet and without even giving much direction, gave the perfect cut i wanted! Will definitely be back!",positive
"I came to the Office because I'd lived in Phoenix for one year and had a hard time finding a stylist for my pixie cut. After several attempts at different places, I tried the Office and had a great experience with Sarah. She took the time to talk to me about what I wanted and had great recommendations. She listened to what I wanted, and now she's been helping me grow out my pixie cut and given me suggestions for the difficult stages. This is a fun place to go and I always feel comfortable here.",positive
"My first time here! Recommended by several friends, and I was not disappointed. Sarah did an amazing job on my long and lifeless hair, gave me some layers and taught me some tricks to replicate at home! I'll definitely be back!!",positive
"Kevin at the Office is amazing with cut & color. After trying several barber shops/salons around town, I have found my home. I have short hair, so typically for a cut I would go see a barber, but with Kevin he actually shapes and styles my hair unlike anyone else has. I always get compliments. For color, I wouldn't trust anyone else. I always get exactly what I ask for. Also, the salon is very cute and all of the staff are friendly and professional. Check it out!",positive
"I was in a hair rut and went out on a limb after reading the Yelp reviews and was not disappointed! Matthew has cut my hair twice now and I love love love both styles! It's super stressful trusting your hair to someone you don't know, but Matthew is so knowledgeable--from the products to use, to best styles for hair types and the steps he's taking throughout the appointment. Definitely get a spot with Matthew before he books up!",positive
"This place was great. I was recommended to use a stylist here by a friend. She happened to be leaving on vacation but they still got me in next day with another one. He was amazing, made me comfortable with the big change I was going to have. Had 15 inches cut off and it turned out great. I get compliments on it all the time. He even told me to call if I had any problems styling it or if I find any problems. Strongly recommend going here.",positive
"I am new to the area and found The Office had desirable Yelp reviews. Trying a new salon and stylist can be scary stuff! I am pleased to say that I LOVED everything about my visit. My stylist Max was marvelous. He took the time to truly listen to what I wanted, he was vocal about everything he was doing and offered perfect solutions to my hair woes. I was super impressed with his round brush technique and my color turned out better than I had expected. The other stylists were friendly and the salon itself had a great vibe. I am coming back for sure and will be trusting Max to work his magic on my hair again.",positive
I love this place! It brightens my day when I know I get to come here and get my hair done. The atmosphere is very welcoming and by the time you leave you will feel like you've known them forever! Max does an amazing job with my hair and actually gives me the look that I am going for.,positive
"You have got to go to The Office for some fun and a great, great cut!!!!!! Usually I get my hair cut in a familiar salon near my house. I have been thinking of growing it a bit longer so I am in between styles. On vacation this week and out of state, I decided to look on yelp for a place that specializes in shorter styles and yelp reviews for Sherri were a 5 across the board. I figured what the heck and I made an appointment right on line. Convenient!! Sherri was as awesome as my haircut. She asked me a lot of questions before she started to cut which helped her understand how much (or little in my case) that I want to spend on my style once I am out of the shower. Sherri's questions put me at ease and when all was said and done my haircut was super, and easy to care for. Sherri took time to teach me how to apply products like pom and different looks with the same cut. Thanks to all the crew at The Office",positive
"Came from So Cal for Spring training baseball. Has long hair and decided to get it cut while here in Phoenix. Did some Yelp searching and decided Sherri was the one to do it. Scheduling was very easy. Sherri asked me lots of questions on what on hair cut I was leaning towards, and care and time I was willing to invest in to keep it looking good. We looked through some Styles on Pinterest. I am thrilled and very happy with my new style. Awesome cut Sherri. I would seriously consider driving 5 hours to have her keeping it looking great too!!! Great friendly stylist all in all.",positive
"It is all true about Sherri! She is amazing!! I wanted to cut my extra-long hair into a pixie, and she is the only hairdresser who would agree to do the cut! I have never gotten so many compliments on my hair!!",positive
"Sherri is awesome! I'm just a dude, so I don't know about color, etc. But I do have difficult hair to deal with (what's left of it anyway). And she does a great job making me look presentable. And even when all of my hair is gone, I'll keep coming in for those awesome head massages.",positive
"Love this place! Was going to the same spot for years and needed a change. So I gave The Office a shot. Soooo glad I did. It's scary trusting your hair to someone new, but Kevin was such a pro that I immediately felt comfortable. He asked a ton of questions up front to make sure we were on the same page. I got a cut and color and left feeling happier about my hair than I have in years. So glad I found a new place!",positive
"I am not a typical female-- going to the salon for me is torture rather than pleasure. I just don't like to sit idle and am a busy body. Recently, late one afternoon, I decided it was time for a haircut. I jumped on YELP and typed in best salons in Phoenix"" Keep in mind I had no appointment and was calling around with the expectation of getting in within the hour. I really lucked out because I found Matthew at ""The Office"" He was just about to leave for the day when I called. Not only did he stay late for my haircut, but after I got there and we started talking, he suggested color which although I knew I needed I had not dared to expect both cut and color at 5pm without an appointment! Matthew is as sweet as they come. We chatted and I felt extremely comfortable with him. The end result of my color and cut could not have been any closer to exactly what I wanted. He is very knowledgeable regarding color. I would highly reccommend The Office and Matthew in particular. I don't have any experience with any of the other stylists there.",positive
"I found Jamie by simply searching ""Pixie Cuts"" on Yelp. I've been trying to keep my hair short but after a busy couple months, my hair was starting to get the characteristic mullet. Jamie spruced me up, showed me some different ways that I can style my hair and voila! She really did a great job and is so flexible with her time that she worked me in for a quick neck trim a month later. Highly recommend, especially if you are thinking of taking the plunge and trying short hair!",positive
Jaime expertly tamed my below-the-butt locks and left me feeling more like I had just had a makeover than a solid trim. Love her.,positive
I was really looking forward to my appointment based on the reviews. I left work early for a 3:30 appointment....which they apparently never put in the schedule. I had scheduled with the stylist herself...so no miscommunication between stylist and scheduler was to blame. So now I have to take off work early again on another day to go to another appointment....with another salon. I'm disappointed they couldn't get the basics right.,negative
"What more can I say about Jaime!?!? So patient (I have a ton of hair), such an awesome communicator (always makes sure I'm getting exactly what I want) and will work to get your hair the way you want it, not the way she wants it. I've been going to Jaime for almost a year and a half now and I've never been happier with my hair. She saved my platinum blonde mess and made it look far more natural than it ever had before. When I decided I wanted to change it up and go ombre, she took the challenge on and now I'm rocking an awesome style that gets complimented almost every day. Thank you, Jaime, for rescuing me from my platinum nightmare and making me feel more naturally beautiful. Also, going to The Office Salon is always a fun time - Kevin and Sherri are hilarious and there is always a great mix of clientele and music. Their product line is amazing and the environment is always clean and inviting.",positive
"I moved to Scottsdale in 2010. The most important service to find was a good cosmetologist. I tried an expensive salon in old town and didn't have a good experience. The best thing that happened for me since moving here was meeting Kevin Anderson through a mutual friend/client of his. He is truly a great hair stylist and a genuine, wonderful person. I look forward to seeing him every time and always leave with beautiful hair - many compliments and friends who have gone to him also because of how my hair looks - cut, color and style. He knows what will look good for each person. I am so happy for him to have his own salon now, he was formerly at Dylan's in Arcadia. Wish him all the best, he will be my stylist as long as I live here!!!",positive
Thank you Sherri for another great cut & color!! This is a great salon! Great atmosphere and very friendly service! Highly recommend!!,positive
"Sherri is the best ever! I have hopped around to different salons all over the Phoenix/ Scottsdale area and I finally feel like I have found a place that I am going to make my one and only hair salon. Sherri takes time to listen to what I want done and she asks questions to make sure that it is going to come out exactly how I want it (and it always does). With many other places I have been I have felt the need to rush home and fix my hair style after I leave, but with Sherri I want to go out and show off what she has done. She is also super cool and funny and easy to talk to. I would recommend Sherri to anyone!",positive
If you are looking for a place for great hair and a comfortable salon this is the place to try. Kevin is the best my hair has never been in better condition since I started going to Kevin. Along with the products i will reference as hair crack smells yummy. Check them out very relaxed and comfortable.,positive
"Kevin has been my trusted colorist and stylist for several years. As most women know, the hairdresser client bond is often times more important than any romantic relationship. He is a friend and incredibly talented. He is also very competitive price wise and I would follow him anywhere. I am thrilled he has his own adorable yet chic salon of his own.",positive
"I love this salon! From the stylist to the decor this place is great. Jaime V. has been my stylist for awhile now and I won't see anyone else but her! I trust her, her style and judgement with my hair. She's honest and a perfectionist. You won't leave disappointed if you go see Jaime!",positive
"Jaime has been doing my hair for months! I seriously wouldn't let any else touch my hair besides her! She knows exactly what I want every time I go in and keeps track of what we have done with my hair in the past. She is simply amazing and has the greatest personality, I adore her! The Office Salon has such a retro cool vibe yet makes you feel right at home. I look forward to my appointment each and every time. If you are looking for a great stylist (Jaime, Sherri or Kevin) and a cool place to get your hair done... GO to The Office Salon!!",positive
Kevin the owner is the best very knowledgable and polite. He really knows his way around a head of hair. Gives the best head massages while washing your hair.,positive
"Not sure. Had a 10:00 appointment, and owner?/stylist was a no show. Finally called at 10:15 and said was having trouble getting a cab. Hard to own a small business if you can't manage guest expectations or time.",negative
"I was referred to Kevin by a friend after having a few coloring disasters by multiple hair stylists. I came to him with a spectrum of wrong colors going through my hair and he was able to make me look amazing. It is never brassy and it always still feels healthy afterwards, not dry and damaged like other times I have had it overprocessed. It is a little of a drive for me but I would follow him anywhere!! It has been almost 2 years now and every time I get my highlights, I am so relieved that my hair is in the care of his talented hands. I highly recommend him!",positive
I went to Kristy twice and told her exactly what I wanted but I didn't like either haircut in fact I went home in tears after the last one. I think she is great for younger people but I am older. I will not return.,negative
"Chelsea cuts my hair -- she's great. Kristy doesn't cut my hair, but she's great too. Found this salon on Yelp when I moved into town a year ago and I'm glad I gave them a call. Online booking makes it easy for me to set appointments, and Chelsea will often text me to let me know when she's available earlier than planned in case I want to come in sooner. Definitely recommend them.",positive
"I have been going to Kristy for my hair needs, for over a year. She was my first choice for hair and makeup for my wedding this past October, and she did not disappoint. She made the drive to Sedona and was amazing with her work. Always prompt and professional, she even did my mother's hair and everything turned out beautiful. I'm so happy with the way that my wedding pictures came out, Kristy enhanced my features so that the makeup and hair would pop. If you want something done the right way, go to The Shear Shack, you won't regret it, absolutely love this place.",positive
Been looking long and hard for a salon to help me with my edgy pixie experimentation. Kristy was awesome and very attentive to what I wanted to try. Affordable with quality.,positive
"Love this place - Kristy does a fantastic job with my highlights and is very patient with doing my hair (I have A LOT, our last appointment took 3 hours when only allotted for 2.5 - I'm so sorry but thank you!!). Her salon is cute, clean, and charming. Highly recommend!",positive
I recently had my hair done (cut & highlights) at The Shear Shack....I love it!!! Kristy did a fantastic job! My highlights came out just how I wanted & the cut was actually better than what I thought I wanted. I was unsure of a cut/style as I'm trying to grow my hair out from a very short cut & Kristy took my idea along with her own (of course she asked me before she just snipped away) & I absolutely love it!!! I will be back for sure! Definitely recommend The Shear Shack! :),positive
"I got my hair dyed purple and I followed their instructions very clearly and yet it was gone from most of my hair within 2 weeks. I only washed my hair once in a week with cold water, which is what they instructed which is why I find it weird it faded so quickly. I honestly think they either did a bad job dying my hair or they used a cheap hair dye. I called to let them know and they said I could get it re-dyed for $75 but I was not willing to risk paying that kind of money again for nothing. I also got a haircut and I'm highly pleased with it. Would only recommend you go here, to cut your hair not to dye your hair. Overall I'm giving it 1 star because I feel like I wasted my money, on dying my hair although the staff was very friendly.",negative
"I'm a 24 year old female who was having a hard time finding a good hair stylist. I've tried many of the cheaper $15 dollar hair cut places and odds are, 9/10 times my hair was always messed up on in some way, took way too much off (yea hair grows back but I'm paying you to listen to what I'm requesting, not just do your own thing and have me out of your chair in 10 minutes) or my layers were choppy beyond belief!!! I searched and searched and finally took to yelp to see if there was anything near by I hadn't seen or heard of before, that's where I saw this place. All the great reviews are what made me pick this place for my next hair cut. Like a gal before me states, you pay $15 bucks and you get a $15 dollar hair cut. I've had my hair dyed at a salon but never cut so I wasn't really aware of what to expect. The building this is located in, I'll admit I went through the wrong door the first time around and got horribly lost lol. Now I know. Walking in, it's smaller than what I'm used to BUT it's also not a chain company, it's someone who wanted to start their own business to make their dream a reality. I arrived early for my appointment and was greeted, I sat down and explained my horror stories of past hair cuts and pleaded for her to please be my holy grail lol she then asked me to go to the shampoo bowl so I'm like okay. Yes I have thick hair, it needs to be drenched with water before hand..then conditioner ! Oh okay, I like this...then a nice little towel dry and then the magic began. Chelsea took her time with cutting my hair the exact way I wanted and didn't stray from my idea. I was in the chair for a little over an hour and I cannot explain how pleased I am of the overall result of my afternoon mini spa day there. There was some nice casual conversation, not dead silent or being ignored by the stylist. I was included in every conversation which made me feel like I was having my hair done by a long lost friend. It was $40 flat for the cut, shampoo, condition AND. Blow out!! All included (then whatever you tip) I can now say I have found my holy grail. I will never stray from you!",positive
"Kristy is great! Does a perfect cut and k ones how to add great color. Tried the color just at the roots and it looks awsome. Used a Coarl color and it almost looks natural, but fun still!",positive
"Love, love, love The Shear Shack Salon!!! I can't say enough good things... I was looking for a new salon (moved to phoenix about 5 months ago) and found Kristy's place on Yelp. Made an appointment to see Chelsea, don't let her age fool you, babygirl is SUPER talented! Chelsea did such an amazing job, I have never ever received so many compliments on my hair before ;) I can't wait for my next appointment! Thank you so much Kristy and Chelsea, you girls ROCK!!!",positive
"I am pretty picky about who touches my hair.... I mean, I guess most of us are....anyway, Chelsea took care of me and my two daughters and now she is my new stylist. She knows how to deal with people and make them feel at ease and she definitely has skillz :p",positive
"I've never received as many compliments as I have since I started seeing Kristy - well over a year ago. I will never change and I will ALWAYS book in advance. First off, when I moved here from the midwest my hair underwent disaster after disaster as I tried to save a couple bucks and go to Chain-Hair salons. I finally saw this place with excellent reviews and decided that if Kristy could see me - I would give it a shot. I never imagined that I would recommend her services to all my friends and even the people I meet out and about. What's so great about the Shear Shack. Well Kristy for one, but as you've seen on other reviews, Chelsea now for reason number 2. They often overlap with each other so I feel confident in Chelsea's abilities/training and customer service since Kristy is there teaching her how she runs the Shack. So reason number 3 is all the compliments I get on my hair. Which translates into expertise and skill. These compliments range from the color (usually something in the reds but her crafty color skills are dazzling), the healthy shine, the bounce and volume, the realistic look...I could just keep going. Kristy takes the time to consider more than just what a client wants, but what is realistic. She discusses the pros and cons, and helps guide the client through the process. Kristy will advise the client on how to achieve the end result and maintain the integrity of the hair. #4 Cost - SUPER REASONABLE. You get what you pay for. So if you want a $15 haircut - your hair will probably look like you got a $15 hair cut. Kristy's prices sometimes surprise me in how reasonable they are. I like to touch up my roots (again, red is not the easiest color to maintain when your hair grows super fast) every three-four weeks. This would cost me a fortune at other salons, but Kristy keeps it super reasonable. In fact, her prices were one of the reasons I chose her. I've had whole color applications, high lights, low lights, cuts, styles, and loved what I paid every time. #5 Time and Respect. I've never waited more than ~10 minutes before for an appointment. Kristy books responsibly and holds her appointments. She is always there when she says she is. I know I can count on her keeping to our time so I don't miss a hot date later that night. Once, I even missed my appointment and she called and was able to reschedule me. I loved that she understood I had forgotten (one and time - I'm a woman of my word too) but still really needed my hair fixed up. Other stylists don't bother calling you but I love the text reminders/email reminders I get. I love that I can book online too. From my experience - she is great with kid cuts, weekly hair maintenance, men's cuts, women's everything. I could just keep going on and on but will let you find out for yourself!",positive
"SO happy I found Shear Shack! I just moved back to AZ from the midwest and was really upset that I had to find a new salon. I'm very picky about my hair so I googled tons of places before finding this place. All of the good reviews prompted me to go in. My first visit was the beginning of January and I saw Chelsea. She was super nice and at the time did my hair perfectly! I was so ecstatic since I was so worried I'd never find a place I loved again. Last week I decided I wanted to cut more off so I made an appointment with Kristy just to switch things up and so I could try both. Kristy is just as amazing, I love my new hair and I was so afraid to cut off as much as I did. I'll recommend this place to anyone near me looking for a good haircut. I haven't tried color here yet but I'm sure I will at some point!",positive
"The girls are awesome! Chelsea is very good at what she does. We discussed what i wanted and she didn't disappoint. She puts you at ease and talks you through the whole thing. She stops periodically to update you on the length and the cut. No surprises no tears . Kristie is so much fun to be around. The girls make a good team, i highly recommend this place.",positive
I made an apt because of all the reviews on yelp and I'm glad I did! Chelsea cut my hair and she did an awesome job! I have long hair and she understood my anxiety in cutting it LOL! She was very patient and really listened to what I wanted. Great place plus my hair looks AWESOME! Thanks Chelsea :),positive
I went there before a wedding last March. I had let my hair grow out for awhile in preparation for getting victory rolls. She made my hair look amazing and gave me tips for how I can try it at home!,positive
"I am three months new to phoenix. This is my second salon. This is my only salon now! Kristy worked magic with my really bad haircut. She gave me a great pixie cut that looks great and is easy to style! Can I just say I love it and ""thank you"" Kristy. ""It's so cute!""",positive
"After relocating to Sun City this was my second try looking for a new hair stylist. Well, I hit the Mother Lode.... Lol. Found Kristy on Yelp, couldn't be happier!!! She listen to my concerns and did a wonderful job, I have short, thick hair, I don't want to look matronly but yet I don't want to look like a 30 yr old hipster either.... Prices are great also. Thank You Kristy!!",positive
Kristy is amazingly talented and very personable. I just moved here and went to her based off of these reviews. It was worth it. She's excellent with short hair!!! She is my new hair lady.,positive
"Thank yooooou, Yelp! Since moving to PHX I haven't had anything done to my hair (blaaaah) & I came on here to find someone who could do a really good cut as well as ombre color. Shear Shack came up & I was able to make an appointment on her website which was awesome. I arrived & Kristy was as sweet as could be. I showed her a picture of what I wanted & discussed some concerns which she addressed & really helped put me at ease. Kristy was so friendly & we chatted the whole time, I love that I wasn't just sitting there in an awkward silence which has happened at other places before. I felt like we were old friends. She REALLY knows what she's doing! My color is great & I love my cut, it looks so healthy! To top it off, her salon interior is AWESOME & totally retro! So glad I was able to find someone who was able to accomplish exactly what I was wanting. I'm really looking forward to making another appointment again soon!",positive
"I wish there were more stars to rate The Shear Shack Salon. I love the results, and get so many complements from my family and friends. The Shear Shack Salon is such a classy little salon. Every time I go I get a great cut and color and blow out. This is not your average walk in Great Clips cookie cutter stylist. Kristy is the best. I even have my hubby going and she does a great job with his beautiful curly hair.",positive
"Shear Shack is by appointment only. Not that this is apparent from their website where business hours are clearly listed, but this is clearly the case as I was turned away today by the stylist because ""she was just stopping in today.""",negative
"OMG!!! Kristy done an awesome job on my daughter hair. I couldn't be more happier, she looks so stylish. I was a little nervous because she has short hair. So if you want the hipster look Kristy the one to go too. Thanks Kristy",positive
I love my hair! My stylist moved away and I've been looking for new person I could go to and become a regular. I have found that with Kristy. I am thrilled with my cut! I went in with no real idea of what I wanted I just knew I needed it cut. Kristy worked her magic and I'm so happy!,positive
"Finally! Someone who understands how to convert a brunette into a blonde. Kristy uses great products and knows exactly what she is doing. She does what YOU want, not what she thinks you should have. I love the way she listens and then makes it happen. I have a lot of hair and it is very long. She makes my hair look amazing time after time. I want just plain old blonde, nothing fancy and she doesn't try to do weird highlights or cuts. Though, she is capable of doing those different colors and cuts because I've seen her work on others. She is very versatile like that. Kristy can give you what you want regardless of what it is. I LOVE shear shack and recommend it to anyone!!",positive
"Kristy does the best vintage styles & updo's I've ever seen. If you are looking for an updo, vintage style for your wedding, prom, date or just because look no further than Kristy at The Shear Shack!",positive
Kristy R. is one heck of a stylist. I can't believe she has left Denver now I am left a hair orphan! She has always done a great style and cut and I would recommend her to anyone.,positive
I like going to a stylist to get my hair cut and Kristy is the best to go too!! She has a $5 off men's cuts on Wednesdays and that's when you'll find me there!!,positive
"You have to admit, its takes a lot for a guy to wander into a salon to get his hair cut in a place generally associated with women getting their nails done, do's did, and GOSSIPING ALL THE DAMN DAY LONG!!! But if you know anything about me, I got some seriously awesome hair. I mean we are talking Don Draper in his prime kind of hair. And it really takes someone special to get that right. Fade with a part to the side, little pomp in the front, and comb over. oh and LOTS OF GREASE!!!! This is barber shop stuff that local barber shops don't know how to do anymore! Kristy does it all.......... Instead of waiting forever to get butchered at some barbershop in the mall, swing by Kristy's place and get a cut that's quick, cheap, and high quality!! You can even book on the phone, email, or Facebook and not have to wait! She even sends email reminders for those forgetful soles (Me!).

"Best hair I've ever had! Kristy is so good I carry her cards around because people ask me how I get my hair to look so good! It's not me, it's my stylist!",positive
I get my haircut from Jenna. She is such an amazing hair stylist and the sweetest girl I have ever met. I also get my daughters haircut with her and she loves going there and her hair is always beautiful from the cut all the way down to the Paul Mitchell baby shampoo so it doesn't burn her eyes. 5 stars is the most I can pick but you will not be disappointed. Such a great family business. Adam R,positive
"I have had positive experiences at this salon in the past but Kim left sores in my head. I have been blonde most of my life and never recieved a chemical burn, been scalded by hot water (that I asked to be turned down), been told she was doing been a favor at the same time she is freaking out that my hair was neon yellow..... I could go on but won't. I wish she would have asked Tony for assistance as I requested. This bad experience could ruin my hair for years. I am sad and greatly disappointed. Please be careful with who you choose to touch your hair as getting the wrong color could be the least of the damage.",negative
At this salon you will find a hairdresser named Jeff Olivier and you will not be disappointed. He is your go to guy for hair color. He'll do whatever it takes to give you the best experience. And he's located at a salon that has the best atmosphere! You'll def be taken care of with the finest Paul Mitchell has to offer. Thinking of going from black to silver? I did and Jeff Olivier did not disappoint! Very friendly and personable and you'll leave there looking and feeling like a million bucks. A++++++,positive
I absolutely love the work Geoffrey does on my hair. He always has new and awesome ways to fix it. He colors and tones it perfectly every time!!! I always leave there looking like a million bucks!! Thanks Geoffrey,positive
"I highly recommend looking elsewhere. The stylist didn't listen to anything I asked for, I had to interrupt him 2 times while he was cutting my hair and say that's not what I want and he would just argue with me that he knew what he was doing. He clearly didn't, he messed up my hair and did whatever he wanted. The shampooing was the worst experience I have ever had I left with a head ache and a terrible hair cut. Find somewhere else!",negative
"Had the best experience here! The setting is super cute, I really love the rustic look. I had Kim who did an absolute amazing job. Kim, I've never been so satisfied walking out of a salon. Thank you so much!!! The staff are all really nice and friendly.",positive
"Today is my first visit, walk out with big smile, my hair stylist is Ms. Kim, she is very very friendly, very sweet and professional. I already make my next appointment with her. They are deserved 5 stars !",positive
"Kim is amazing. Took in a picture for inspiration and walked out with the look. I have very thick hair with curl, it requires a lot of time. Kim put in almost 2 hours into cutting about 3 inches off. She is amazing!",positive
"Wonderful place with caring and talented owners and staff. I came in here with an actual hair emergency. They stayed open late to help me and Kim did an AMAZING job. The other salon I went to first did a terrible thing to my hair and Kim worked a miracle and fixed it for me, way better than what I expected could be done. Wonderful atmosphere and you can tell that the staff is not only really good at what they do but they also love doing it.",positive
I moved here from out of state and was stressing out to find a great hair stylist. I have platinum blonde hair and have had many stylists in the past screw it up. I was scheduled with Jeffrey Olivier and he was amazing! I would highly recommend him. It was pricey but worth it because he didn't screw up my hair. He is a Master Stylist. Thank you Jeffrey! I also loved the atmosphere and everyone in their was kind and welcoming. I would recommend this salon to family and friends.,positive
"Tony and his high quality and professional associates are just simply the BEST!! If you want to feel and look like a movie star after a visit to your hair dresser, look forward no more!",positive
Tony is amazing! I haven't been so happy with my hair in years I'm so grateful I found him! He takes his time and know what he's doing. He and his staff are super sweet and everyone seems actually happy to be there unlike the majority of salons. I highly recommend him and would never go to anyone else!!! Thank you Tony!,positive
I just moved to Vegas and was looking for a new salon and someone I could trust with my hair. I saw pictures of Claudia's work on Yelp and checked out her instagram @lovelydisguises and knew I found the one! She is so sweet and works hair MAGIC! She is your girl if you want a gorgeous balayage.,positive
"I went and saw Cynthia C to get my hair done after I got engaged and she is the prettiest and nicest girl! I follow her on instagram and see how her work gets better with every client. The salon is very industrial and the whole staff is really friendly, they're always making sure you're okay and comfortable and they have a variety of drinks to sip on while you get pampered! My hair came out AMAZING and I can not wait to keep seeing her I recommend anyone with curly or straight hair to see her, she is confident in what she does and makes sure you are happy with the end result",positive
I've been getting my hair cut by Erica for about a year now and she always does an incredible job! Every time I come in she pays attention to details and makes sure I'm happy with how everything. Always super friendly and outgoing with a big smile.,positive
"Love everything about this salon. Great vibe, everybody was super friendly, (Claudia) @lovelydigsguises who did bayalage on my hair was amazing!!! (Pictures on her Instagram) I will definitely be back!",positive
"I have been taken care of by Claudia for the past 4 months and everything from as soon as i walk in the door to the moment i have to leave is a nice experience. I have to say getting my hair rinsed and my scalp massaged was a pleasant surprise, since i went from going to super cuts to the comfort of Barbershops, i remember telling her i wanted to skip it cus i didnt want to pay extra for extra services, but surprisingly this came at no additional cost. This is at another different level to what i am accustomed to and a totally different experience. I needed my hair to be ready for a wedding and ever since i started going to Tony Moreno's, Claudia set up a plan for me to get the goal of my desired hair lenght and style. Every time with each visit my hair would look and get better and better Ive posted a couple of pictures of the wedding day because thats how happy i am with the work. I really dont see myself going back to any other place. Plus the price difference is not that different. Also the Salon has unique look and feel to it. All the stylist are very welcoming and nice. You have to be there to believe it..",positive
Definitely a 10 on every aspect of my experience... Claudia is very professional Will definitely recommend her to all my friends and family.. Thank you Claudia!!! Love my hair..,positive
"I only ever get my hair cut here, i'm always happy with the way my fiance's hair turns out. All of the employees are friendly and inviting. Tony Moreno's is much better than those shitty $5 chop-shops and worth every penny. And they have the skills to back up their beautiful establishment.",positive
"Don't let the orange hair scare you! Michi is amazing! All the reviews are true, if you're looking for someone who LISTENS and gives you exactly what you want, Michi is your girl! I had to look for a new stylist, mine retired at an ripe old age of 25 to be a stay at home mom (I'm not bitter, lol) I have long straight hair and most stylists jump to wanting to chop it all off or cutting more than a ""trim"". I talked to Michi about it and you can tell how passionate she is about hair and exceeding her clients expectations. She made subtle suggestions and can be as creative as you allow her to be. She mentioned that creativity comes in after she understands your boundaries, which I can totally appreciate! We spoke about some of my impulsive styles that pop in my head every once in a while, like bangs or a soft wavy perm and she gave me advice, her thoughts and honest opinions and next steps if that's what I wanted to do. What I appreciated was that she said she'll question bangs and make you question it before she'd actually agree to doing it. Having just had a baby, she made good points and we decided not to do it. Because my highlights had grown out and not having a lot of time to maintain my hair (newborns don't like to wait for a 3 hour hair session) we decided on low lights and doing My version of a ghetto ombré for lack of words and she gave me a classy, beautiful blend! She also did an extra step to give me more immediate results (which exceeded my expectations completely) I also told her I'm a low maintenance hair person and she suggested texturizing to prevent knots. She's sure to tell you what she's doing every step of the way so you are aware of what she's doing, which makes you feel super comfortable! I put all my trust in her to do her thang, whatever she felt would look best and my hair looks amazing. Listen people don't go filling up her schedule so that I can't get back on the books! But I can't keep her a secret because Las Vegas deserves to know that she's hiding out in southern highlands and is a true orange gem!! And contrary to my mom's description of her, It's not tattoos, it's just make-up!",positive
"This is a 5 star business that provides excellent customer service from the second you walk through the door. I have very fine, thin, and blond hair. Basically, a styling nightmare. Thanks to Jenna, I now have a stylish cut that is easy for me to take care of. I'm glad I was referred to Jenna at Tony Moreno about a year ago.",positive
My hair was in such bad shape. I went in for just a hair cut . Kathleen did such a great job on styling and cutting my hair . I decided to go back and get some color and high lights .I am so happy that I found a great place to get my hair done,positive
"Someone recommended Jenna to me. She is one of the worst hairstylist I have ever had. I told her that my hairstylist in Venice, CA used to add some green to the color to neutralize red tones. Jenna simplified this by coloring a layer of my hair to light green. Now, after many months finally the green color is barely noticeable after my new stylist colored it over many times. Jenna thinks that customers want to have a hair color like a clown: pink, black, green etc. Horrible colorist who makes very expensive mistakes. She also did not do my low lights correctly as the right side of my hair was not even close to the low lights on the left. I did go back to have the low lights fixed but I figured she was such an inexperienced and horrible stylist I would never trust her to fix the GREEN tone of my hair. Awful job, should not be licensed!",negative
"I came here to get a cut and I loooove the staff, they are soo hospitable. My hair stylists really listens to what I want and gives me great feedback ( not Attitude). I also come here just to get my hair braided for busy weeks of being a mom, hard worker, gym rat ...etc. I have not got my color done here yet, and if and when I do I'll be sure to post it ! I can't give 5 stars till I get that done and see how it goes.",positive
Same day appointment for a wash and blow dry. Did a great head massage with neck too. Great service and convo. Got compliments.,positive
"I was starting at a new location with my job, and thought to myself now is the time to set yourself a part from the rest. After many years of thinking I am skilled to color my own hair., I reached out for the best after my failed a tempt to reach my younger California surf days. I was lucky to have walked into Kathleen life's, who seemed to share a lot of the same journeys as mine. She really connected to me, all though our age is at least 10 years apart. Kat was amazing she gave me the full experience of what stylists should do.. I believe and continue to believe. Thank you Kathleen for not only giving me the confidence to conquer my new job, and making me look good. But somewhere between it all I feel I gained a friend",positive
"My hair was hacked by someone who I thought knew what she was doing with bob cuts so I let I grow a couple of months and then went in to the Tony Moreno salon to have it fixed. Michi was my stylist and she did a fantastic job! I didn't think there was much that could be done to make it look better as it grows out, but she managed to give me a much better look without taking off very much length! I left the salon feeling a lot better about myself because my hair was no longer crooked and weird looking",positive
I've been coming here for a few years now. I've followed Tony from salon to salon and I'm glad he opened up his own place. The stylists are excellent and professional. I've had haircuts from a few of them and have never been disappointed.,positive
This is the BEST salon ever and Tony is the absolute MASTER of hairstylists! I have been a client of Tony's for 8 years and everyday I get compliments on my hair. People are amazed that it could be sooo blonde and sooo healthy/silky soft. I recommend this salon to everyone and I will never go anywhere else! Thank you Tony for making me look amazing!,positive
"The new location is wonderful. So big and open and much easier to find. As soon as you walk in, you are offered a beverage. The staff is awesome. Jenna, my stylist, is nothing short of amazing. She is so talented and creative. She can do anything with hair. She always has great suggestions too. While the salon is a bit pricey, you get what you pay for.",positive
"My first visit at Touché with Audrey. So very happy with my cut and color that I've already booked my next two appointments. I've been searching for the perfect place over the last two years. Truly believe I've finally found it. Great atmosphere, totally comfortable salon. I live in Scottsdale but can get to this location in Fountain Hills in 20 minutes. What a great way to start my day. Highly recommend!",positive
"Looking for an expert in gray hair? I'd like that blend it, or make the gray and nice blond tone so as it grays, it blends. Please send me pics as examples. Thanks.",positive
"This place will leave you transformed. It's both a casual and capable professional salon. Audrey, deserves the praises of us all. She has exquisite skills and I walk out with great hair and receive endless compliments. Aveda products, too. This is an oasis in Fountain Hills.",positive
"Touche Hair Design is the best salon in the valley! The staff is great. I get my haircut from Audrey and she is amazing! I don't live in the same area but my 30 minutes drive to get my hair done by Audrey is absolutely worth it! She can turn a worst disaster into a masterpiece. She definitely cares about her work and makes sure you leave the salon feeling and looking awesome.She listens well,makes suggestions and gives you feedback. People consistently give me compliments and tell me, ""Wow, that's a great haircut"",""Where did you get your hair done from?"",etc. I can definitely say I love my haircut each time I visit Audrey. Do yourself a favor and give this salon a try, you won't be disappointed, in fact you won't go anywhere else after visiting Touche Hair Design.",positive
"When I moved to Fountain Hills from Chicago I had to give up my hair dresser of 25 years. I was devastated. By chance I walked into Touché Hair Design with photos of what I wanted in regard to the perfect haircut just for me. ""My wind blown look."" I found Violetta, (Violet). She listened, looked at the photos and I left with the best hair cut I have ever had. I mean that. She is perfect. Plus she is happy and fun to talk to about anything. Patricia R.",positive
"Touche is an amazing place with many talented hair stylists. I highly recommend requesting Kim Brown when you call or walk-in. She's very experienced and I've been working with her for 3 years, she's amazing, talented and so considerate! Everyone there is so sweet and inviting, you certainly won't regret choosing them. It's a very relaxing environment.",positive
"This was my first visit to Touche. It was wonderful. My hair was a disaster prior to Audrey working her magic with my cut and highlights. The atmosphere of the salon was very peaceful, I immediately felt at ease. I would highly recommend Touche!",positive
I have been a customer of Audrey's for several years. I only go to touché and Audrey to get my haircut now. She is very professional and talented. I have sent several friends to her who have complimented me on my hair style. They are always happy they went and now get their haircuts and styling only with Audrey. Touché is an Aveda salon with only quality products. The salon is comfortable with several seating areas.,positive
"IMy experience with this salon was really great! I was able to get a wonderful stylist (Audrey), she was a true perfectionist with my hair. She took the time to really get to know what type of length and cut I wanted. (even brought over a few books to choose the bang length),... I had originally called due to the fact that they carry Aveda products and she was really informative with each item. Also washed my hair in the Aveda products I was originally calling about so I was able to really experience the products first hand. I would highly recommend this salon if you are looking for a salon with skilled stylists.",positive
"Having a bad hair day?? Look no more! Touche Hair Design can make your day better with a new do, great music, and sensible conversation! Audrey ""fixed"" a bad hair cut from another salon with ease and assurance. She listens to her customers needs and offers professional advice to enhance your hairstyle. Definitely try this shop out! I'm stylin'in Fountain Hills, Az",positive
"Love how my hair turned out. She actually listened to what I wanted and gave me a few suggestions before doing a color, cut, and style that turned out to be exactly what I was looking for.",positive
I always feel welcome here & I get tons of compliments on my hair. Maytee works her magic & voila! Beautiful!!! Thank you Maytee & True Essence!!!,positive
"This is absolutely the best place to get your hair done! I drive 45 minutes just to go here. The service is excellent and I always leave with the best hair. They do scalp and hand massage, and hot towel wrap while getting your hair washed. Reagen has magic hands! I have never gotten more compliments, even from total strangers. It is worth the drive from anywhere!",positive
"I thought this place was great before, and great just got even better. I still love everything I loved in my previous review, and my haircuts and color are the best I've had anywhere. But I just visited yesterday and they've got a cool new guy working there named Sam who washed out my hair after Maytee did my foil, and he gave me a super relaxing scalp massage (totally free). It was excellent enough to make me want to find this review and mention it in a update. And you know, I think it's these extra little touches in addition to the superior level of hair artistry that really make this place special. BTW, if you're checking out True Essence for the first time, Sam said he is taking new clients.",positive
"I had the same hair stylist for years, and a few months ago she moved to a different state. I was terrified. A friend of mine recommended Sammie, from this salon. I have been going back to her ever since! She is fantastic! She is friendly, professional, and really has a good idea of what hair will work best, but can also replicate anything brought to her. It is not cheap- But well worth it. I would recommend Sammie (I have never been to any other stylist) to anyone!",positive
"Update: My regular hair stylist was in a car accident and I found myself scrambling for a last-minute appointment, and calling every hair salon in Mesa. I finally found a place with an opening, not realizing that True Essence was the salon I had sworn to never go to again. I thought I had called the salon across the street, and it wasn't until I was at the intersection that I realized my mistake. So I sat in the parking lot, debating turning around and driving home or going inside. Looking at my hair in the rearview mirror, I decided I rally didn't have an option. I had to keep my appointment. My appointment was with a stylist named Sammie, and she was excellent. She made some suggestions which I went with, and the color came out looking great. I got highlights and low lights and it looks natural, and the color goes all the way to the roots. I couldn't find a single strand that wasn't perfect. I even gritted my teeth and made a future appointment to see her again. Sammie's work was definitely five stars, but with the previous issues I had, I can't go that high for an overall score. I still believe there are issues with the lack of customer service and the failure of the manager to respond (I waited over a week before posting my previous review to give them a chance to contact me and rectify the situation), but if I can see Sammie without having to deal with them, I'm OK with that.",positive
"I have been going to True Essence Salon for over 6 years. Maytee always does an amazing job on my hair. I am very particular, as most of us are about our hair and she has always gone far above my expectations. I can trust her to try something different on my hair or do the same thing I have done for a year, she just seems to know what I'm thinking! I highly suggest trying out the salon, you will not be disappointed.",positive
"My neighborhood go to salon. Receive consistently good service - haircuts, massage, and an occasional pedicure. Front desk is friendly - greeting you when you come in, offering water, and efficiently checking me out. When there are problems, Maytee does everything she can to make it right",positive
"I made an appointment at the True Essence Salon for a ""base break"". The appointment resulted in golden/orange roots that the stylist spent a long time trying to correct with a toner. The stylist told me that I can call and come back if I still feel like my roots are too orange. During check out it turned out I was given the wrong service, a color touch up which bleached my roots instead of a base break. When I left the salon and saw my hair in daylight and later in my bathroom light I was very unhappy with how it looked. My roots looked orange in contrast with the rest of my neutral highlighted blonde hair. It looked cheap. I even received negative comments at my work. I called the salon and spoke with the manager. After explaining what happened she booked an appointment for me with an experienced stylist and told me that the corrective procedure may require more time then a base break normally would and that this will be free of charge. When I came in the stylist told me that she would need to add few highlights to the base to neutralize the orange and that this will not be free of charge. I asked to speak with the manager. This time the owner Maytee Green came out, not the salon manager I spoke with. I explained yet again what happened. Even though she seemed to understand what happened she told me that since the correction is more time consuming then just a ""base break"" I would have to pay to get my hair fixed. I tried several times to reason with her but she told me to leave her salon. You shouldn't charge someone to fix what you screwed up in the first place!",negative
I am very disappointed with this salon we came in with a bridal party of four plus the groom came in a little later. As soon as I walked in the stylist was very rude I did not wash my hair because the mother in law of the bride had set our appointments for wash and style. I told her I needed my hair washed and if I knew it was going to be a big deal I would have washed my hair before I came. She argued with me and then washed my hair very fast said she didnt have time for anything but to blow it out. Then I get into the chair and i asked her if she could curl my hair with the extensions she said she could not. They are clip ins it would have taken five minutes. While all of this is going on the stylist that was doing my sisters hair the bride was laughing like it was funny. So I said this isn't going to work if you arent going to do what I want. I'm not going to pay someone to blow out my hair I can do that myself. I am the maid of honor I needed to look nice. So she said ok i walked out with soaking wet hair and had to drive around to 5 other salons to find someone that would take the time to do my hair the way I needed it done. I just got married myself && have had never had a problem like this we had a party of 7 with extensions and hair washes that just came up in a last minute deal.I understand not having the time on an ordinary day but not a wedding day. The customer service part of it was just very rude the bride was very upset I was almost stuck doing my own hair. Please be aware we didn't even get a I'm sorry from the stylist. A wedding day isn't a good time to be a rude person.,negative
"Do not buy the $10.00 Aveda club card. When I went to pick up by birthday gift which expires at the end of February, they would not give it to me because I did not renew my card. Waste of time and waste of money.",negative
"Now maybe I was spoiled by the other Aveda Salon I went to when I lived in Washington, but I feel like charging $30 for a blow dry when you're already paying $65 for a hair color is RIDICULOUS! I made an appointment here to touch up my hair color because my roots were starting to show. I had the color ""recipe"" from my last stylist so I wasn't worried about trying to get the color to match. When I called in to make the appointment the lady I spoke to was very nice and friendly, I did think it was strange at the time that she kept checking to see if I wanted my hair blow dryed, I was used to it just being a standard service after your hair was washed. When I got to the salon the day of my appointment the receptionist was on the phone and didn't greet me. I stood there for a minute before she finally greeted me and asked if she could help me. I told her I had an appointment and who it was with so she said she would tell the stylist I was there. Then she proceeded to keep sitting there talking on the phone about how her son couldn't pull money out of his bank account but she could see that there was money in there!! I was not impressed. The stylist finally did come out (probably thinking I hadn't shown up since no one notified her that I was there) and she was very friendly and welcoming. I gave her my color combination and she seemed to understand it right away, even commenting on the shade which put me at ease that she knew what she was doing. There were just two things about her that kind of put me off. She talked a lot about travelling all over the world and going to different Aveda events and learning different techniques which is great, but it almost felt like she was trying too hard to impress me and then she commented at the end that she had done it all out of pocket and that Aveda didn't pay for it. It was almost like she was name dropping countries she'd been to. The other thing I didn't like was it seemed as though she was trying to shove products down my throat! She asked if I used any Aveda products and I told her I did use several. Now maybe that was my fault for admitting that I use the products, but the WHOLE rest of the time she kept telling me about probably 20+ different products that she recommended for me. I'm sorry but I really don't want to be discussing what kind of exfoliator I use while you're washing the dye out of my hair. Then the final straw was when she asked if I wanted my hair blow dried or not. I paused for a minute because I still thought it was strange for her to ask as I'm sitting there with my hair dripping because I just expected it to be a normal event. She then informed me that it was $30 for a blow dry. I told her that I didn't want to worry about it in that case so she offered to ""kind of"" brow dry it just so that it wasn't dripping when I left. Thanks. I love it when I leave a salon after getting my hair done and it's frizzy and fluffy because you just shook a blow dryer around my head. Normally when I get my hair done I leave feeling hot with a little more swagger in my step. When I left True Essence I immediately put my hair into a pony tail to try and hide the frizz she created and ran home to fix my hair. Not exactly an indication of a great hair experience.",negative
Came to this location yesterday for the new Becca bronzers called ahead and a very nice lady answered the phone she was just soooo nice and put what I wanted on hold. Got to the store ended up getting two more Becca products (this always happens to me) turns out the girl that was ringing me up was the one I talked to again suuuuper friendly I tried reading her name tag I think it said Jenny? She was amazing! The only two things that were annoying that I noticed with this location only are 1. Understaffed cashiers 2. This location puts these obnoxious security tags on their high end makeup that beep so freaking loud every 2 minutes me and other customers were standing like just beeping our lives away! and if you get too close to the door ( and by too close I mean towards the fragrance area) the alarms on them go off so loud you would think I was trying to steal Ulta's soul But other than that had a good experience thanks to Jenny!,positive
"Horrible customer service. Tried to be as easy going as possible about one of my items breaking during shipping. Was told they would not replace the one item, would not order a new one because it's out of stock, won't let me know when it is in stock and ultimately said too bad here's your money back. Sephora hooked me up though with 5$ off just for dealing with Ulta, at least they show customers they appreciate them. Won't be back.",negative
"Went into the store last night for two black eyeliners and left with a bunch of other stuff-- but what else is new when going into Ulta? Anyway, Shannon was super helpful and answered all questions that I had in a friendly and happy manner. Thank you Shannon for assisting me in finding a bunch of new products, it was much appreciated!!",positive
"I try, I really do. I simply never have a decent experience at Ulta. For instance this time I called ahead and wanted to make sure the specific Nars item I was intending on purchasing was in stock before going there. Note, I was running errands and figured I would swing by and scoop it up. Well... I called m, held and waited. Waited so long I preceded to simply drive there. 21 minutes- I'm still on hold and waking into Ulta. The store, which I was still on hold with. Two employees were standing in front of the Nars, just them no customers. Please insert an emoji, rolling my eyes might be suitable. Searched for the item, luckily one left. Yes! Still on hold. 26 Minutes, as I walk over the line. Line, always a line of at least six individuals. I hang the phone up, wait touchscreen hit the end button;) Two cashiers, and not the two who were simply chatting by the NARS section. Waited on the line, yes, I clearly timed it. 15 minutes, give or take twenty seconds. I try about three times a year with Ulta, and always similar experiences. Store is never quite neat and tidy, as for the help well I will refrain on that. Sephora rules.",negative
"Avoid the salon for ""blowouts"". My hair going in and coming back out after a ""blowout"" service looks exactly the same, except with a lot more product's perfumed in my hair.",negative
"Warning this is going to be long. Sorry! I come to this ulta all the time because it's pretty close to me, it's clean, and Nicely stocked. I work in a hotel on the strip so hospitality and costumer service is a big thing to me. And the people that work here have awful customer service. The lady at the cashier counter greeted me when I walked in ""welcome to ulta!"" It was very nice. My birthday was in 2 days so I needed a new brow pencil. I had plenty on time and I love browsing, so I'm in the urban decay section, looking at the heat palette and one employee asked if I needed anything, I replied "" oh no I'm just browsing for now just looking at this new palette"" and she said ""if you need anything just ask."" Not in a very happy tone almost like she forced herself to say it. I said "" thank you I will!"" I see a man sitting by the little table next to the urban decay on his phone. In my mind he's just a guy waiting for his girlfriend, I look and move on. Then as I'm walking around about 5 employees ask if I need anything. I again tell each of them no I'm just looking around in this section. And we all move on, then as I keep moving up sections the same employees asked me about 10 times again if I need anything. I was getting kinda annoyed. So I said "" no no I will ask if I need help, thanks."" I'm still trying to be nice. Then I finally get the Anastasia section for my brows, pick my color and then I was looking at the lipsticks. And again the same employees kept asking if I needed anything I said "" no. I'm fine"" and I said it kind of moody so they could know, no im fine please let me shop in peace. Back to the guy, he had passed me a couple times, again I'm thinking he's just killing some times for his girlfriend or whoever. And as I'm walking the employees kept hovering over me, so I moved into the NYX section and not one employee came up to me. But this guy was next to me and I was very confused because I looked around the store and all the other costumers where new (as in they just walked in) so it finally clicked to me, this isn't some guy just waiting, he's the security in normal clothes. I know I look kinda young but really I'm not some rebellious teen. If you have something to say, say it. I put all my stuff down walked to the cashier and said you have the worst costumer service I've ever seen. And I left. I'll still come to this ulta because it's close but I'll never browse again.",negative
"After going to a location off of Rainbow and not finding what I needed, I came to the summerlin location. I love everything about this store and if I every need any other beauty products, I will defiantly return to this location. The women who helped me check out, was multitasking and helping other customers while still giving me undivided attention.",positive
"I don't know why there's so many negative reviews, compared to other ulta stores this one is always clean and well stocked with stuff for the most part. I just come here to pick up makeup and beauty needs haven't had my makeup or hair done here. I never had an issue with staff being rude and I wouldn't prefer to go anywhere else.",positive
"I have not been to ulta in months. I was so excited to come in today and shop from all the brands I don't find at Sephora. I started to grab new goodies and put them in the basket. After 15 minutes someone approached me. It wasn't really a friendly approach more like a ""are you stealing"" approach. Before I knew it there was loss prevention lingering by me and a call over the intercom saying ; ""loss provention please watch over cameras 1 & 2"" I felt really uncomfortable.... why couldn't you customer service me and ask if you could hold my purchase at the front? I've worked in retail (Sephora) and this is not how you handle a ""suspicious "" looking person. I got in line and paid for my purchase over $200 while a loss prevention waited for me right by the entrance... ok. I'm a 24 y.o. Woman who happenes too look like a teenager, I get it. But I'm a hardcore shopper and I love makeup and having the consultants show me new goodies and talk to me about it. Maybe if I got that service BEFORE you had me followed and watched. Very turned off by the lack of service . Not going back, I don't even want to support this company any longer. Not professionals. I felt very uncomfortable as the staff stayed in the background talking only among themselves.",negative
"No hi, hello, or how are you. Every single time I come in here, I am literally a ghost to EVERYONE in this store. I'm so sick and tired of this store and I am never coming back again. Even though it's more convenient because of distance, I'd drive else where to get away from the shitty service you guys provide me every single time I come here. I come in looking for Smashbox Photo Finish Water Primer. The lady in the very front of the store doesn't even greet or look at me so I go straight to the Smashbox aisle. I see that there is none. I see an employee pass by and I ask her ""is there any more Smashbox Photo Finish Water Primer?"" All she says is ""No"" as she keeps walking away from me and DOES NOT make eye contact with me at all!!!! I understand you're busy, but at least a hi would work. I am absolutely fucking tired of this store and its shitty service! You guys don't even deserve one star! Ulta should be a place where someone should be able to de-stress and shop for makeup. But no, all you guys do is make me feel unwelcome! This store is pathetic and such a disgrace when it comes to customer service, I am absolutely done with it! I'll make the drive to Town Square or the Rainbow location instead. Until these employees pull their heads out of their snotty asses, which they probably never will, I will never be coming back to this location.",negative
"Went to this location close to opening time. A lady and I waited for 15m for someone to help us. The staff that was there looked disinterested and avoiding us as we patiently waited for them to finish whatever it was they were doing. Totally Avoided eye contact to acknowledge us. I couldn't wait any longer as I was pressed for time. I moved on from makeup section to hair products. Finally, someone from the salon asked me if they could help me after 10m of searching. She was very nice and friendly but not knowledgeable enough to give advice on the hair product (she was a stylist in the salon). It's hard to google also due to Poor connection. So I picked up an item that was familiar with and got outta there. Will have to check out Sephora in the department store in Summerlin which is a bit inconvenient but at least I won't be ignored.",negative
"They emailed me a coupon for $25 haircut and style for first time customers so I booked an appointment online. I had an appointment with Heather at 1:30 pm but I forgot I had to be somewhere so I booked another appointment online at 5:15 pm with Liz. I called in the morning to cancel my first appointment but no one picked up. I tri d to confirm my 5:15 appointment later after calling a few times. Someone picked up after two tries. I came in at 5pm and sat at the salon. After 5 min a guy finally acknowledged me and checked me in. He said Liz was busy with someone but she'll be done soon. I waited till 5:30 and no sign of Liz. I stood up and told the same guy that I have a coupon from Ulta and asked if that was ok. He had an irritated look on his face and asked if he could see the coupon. He said it was fine after looking at the email for god knows how long. 5:50 still nothing from Liz. I got up and told the guy that I have to be somewhere so I'll just leave if she can't accommodate me. He gave me an attitude and said ""But I already told her you're here"". I said politely, I understand but its already 5:50 and I haven't seen her yet. He gave me an irritated look and just said ""ok"" with a rude tone. I walked outta there and had not been back since then. First off, I came 15 min early. Never heard from the stylist. And waited nearly 50 min the store. And somehow I was given an attitude because I had to leave. Wow great customer service Ulta!",negative
"My first ""real"" facial and all I can say is that she did a wonderful job!! When I first walked in I did not think much of the place there were no greetings at all. Which is what I would expect of an Ulta. After being in the store for about 15 min Zendaya came over and told me about there facials which were 30% off!! What a deal! $18.90 for a facial is great with all of the other $60-$100 facials that may damage your skin. My skin is glowing and feels great! I will definitely do this again!! Thanks Zendaya you rocked! The other in the store could take some pointers!",positive
"Rachelle at the Salon at Ulta Beauty is so awesome! She did an amazing job on my makeup and hair, and she has a great personality. I showed her a picture of what I had in mind for my makeup, and I loved the makeup application. Just like the picture I showed her. She explained all the products that she was using, and she introduced me to some brands that I will soon be buying (Julep lip color, Laura Gellar lip scrub, De-slick, and Naked products to name a few). She gave a great classic blowout that showed waves and volume. It was raining today, but my hair stayed in place all night for the event I attended. Thank you, Rachelle!",positive
"I was at Ulta tonight looking for a gift. The girl that helped me was so nice, helpful & very knowledgeable about the beauty products I asked about. Ulta carries high end products as well as drug store brands. The cashier was also super friendly. Good experience!",positive
"I can't say this was this store. I bought an ULTA gift card through their on-line program and never received the card even though the charge was processed by my VISA. ULTA refuses to assist, saying it's a cash star problem. I have two phone numbers for cash star 844.249.2086 (from their website) and 855.741.1209 (from ULTA) and both ring and ring - no one answers, nothing goes to a call queue, They got a lot of financial press from Forbes, etc., but I have to wonder if they have gone out of business and simply absconded with everyone's Christmas money? They sent a response to get a status and sent the link: http://Liquid error:undefined method 'split' fir nil:NilClass"" which, of course, doesn't exist either. What's up, guys, and how do I get my $50 back???",negative
"ULTA Beauty located in downtown Summerlin is a nice place to buy cosmetics, hair styling products in addition to designer perfumes and colognes. This location has a very friendly staff and the store is nice & clean. I have encountered Christina on couple of occasions and each time she has offered excellent customer service and has helped me find what I'm looking for. I believe the customer service may be best at this location. That's why I prefer this store. Its that time of year as far as holidays go and for me this means stockings to stuff. I have always been quite pleased with the selection here and haven't had any problems finding what I am looking for being in stock. Of course if I waited to the last minute it could be a challenge, fortunately I have had the time to get here before the last minute shoppers. ;) The colognes and perfumes are priced accordingly and are comparable to any of the Department stores. I highly recommend this location for most of your beauty supply needs. :)",positive
"This review is for the Ulta Salon! I had the most amazing experience! I had never been to the Salon before so I booked with caution from the other reviews, but I was pleasently surprised! My stylist was Caroline and she was so sweet, gave me great tips for my frizzy hair, and left me with a beautiful haircut and blowout! My hair is soo healthy and soft now! I booked my next appt. right after she finished my hair. Highly recommend Caroline!",positive
"Heather Vaughn is absolutely amazing and the only soul I trust when it comes to my hair. My hair has been screwed up before in the past and heather is my GO TO GAL!!! I had made the mistake of using box dye and completely fried my hair and had it 2 different colors. Heather worked with me to remove the box dye, do deep conditioning treatments, and glaze my hair back to a color similar to my natural color. They are reasonably priced and do an amazing, amazing job. Positive vibes throughout the whole salon and the work is just flawless. Pics to follow.",positive
"Got my haircut here and it was an awful experience. I usually got to another ulta location, however I was in the area and decided to try this one out. The girl who cut my hair was very young (probably in her 20s) and treated me like an idiot. Granted, I am a teenager but this girl couldn't have been that much older than me. She constantly made comments about how damaged my hair was and how my hair care routine was all wrong. I understand as a stylist she knows more about hair than I do, but come on you don't have to be rude about it. I asked her to give me a little bit of layers to take some weight off my thick hair but not to make the layers too short. She made such short layers in the back its embarrassing. My hair is so uneven i've spent the last month keeping it up because its blatantly uneven. My left side is longer than my right, the front and back are short while the middle (chunk of hair beside my ears) are long. It looks awful and I do not trust this ulta to ever do my hair again.",negative
"My fiance bought me Too Faced's Semi-Sweet Chocolate Palette for my birthday, and with it came three sample sized Too Face items: Better than Sex mascara, Born this Way Foundation, and Shadow Insurance primer. I was super excited to try them all, but when I opened the box for the mascara, it was empty! Determined to get my item, I called around the Ultas by my house to see if they could help me. All of them simply told me they were out of the item, and could not do anything. When I called this location, I spoke to Joanne who was actually concerned about the fact that I received an empty package, and promised to help me even though the original purchase didn't even happen at this store. When I arrived at the store, a different employee helped me get my replacement (I don't know her name, but she worked the register at about 4 pm!) She searched all over the store, high and low, and profusely apologized for my empty package. She finally found one in the back, and quickly exchanged mine out. I truly felt the customer service was exemplary here, especially since they were the only store willing to help me (not even the store we purchased the item from would help us!) If this location was closer to me, I would definitely return. But, for now, I highly recommend it for it's outstanding customer service!",positive
Worst color I've ever had! I left there with flaming orange roots and silver ends. The foils are so stripy too. She completely ruined my hair! I asked for my money back and will never return. They need to give their stylists some serious education!,negative
"This review is actually for Stephen at the Ulta Salon in Downtown Summerlin. The Ulta itself seems like other Ulta's, just what you would expect, in a nice location. parking kind of a pain but near other shopping, food etc. I have come to get my hair done twice. I took a chance as I'm new in town and wanted a specific service that Ulta offers that I have a harder time finding other places (accent highlights) I have a couple of photos on my instagram and have already told all my followers to go see Stephen. I recently took the photos of my hair down cause of all the weird men following me (I suspect as a result lol) so that's pretty good advertising but I figured a review over here on Yelp might be better :) I have light hair but it can be resistant to highlighting. I appreciate Stephen got me the right blonde color, no brassiness, no red. nicely woven, no toner needed, fun to talk to. I'm extremely picky about my hair and would not have gone back otherwise. Ulta is also a professional salon compared to some others I have researched in the area which can mean a real lot in the end in terms of feeling comfortable or in case something goes wrong (it didn't for me just something to consider when deciding to go somewhere new and in the sea of groupons and independents floating around in LV)",positive
"Today was my 1st visit to Ulta Salon stylist Ashley. She is absolutely wonderful. She took very good care of me, consulted with me every step of the way, and we called my former stylist Vernon, to make sure all the procedures were accounted for. I am so luck 1st time out, my hair looks fabulous and I look forward to going back in the next 6 weeks.",positive
"I am mystified by the bad reviews about this location. The store manager, Sita, who has helped me on more than one occasion, is friendly and has outstanding customer service skills. The staff has always helped me with the best makeup choices, are a pleasure to work with, and help me arrive at good choices for me. I've even had to make a few exchanges lately (which is rare), and they cheerfully took back the used products with with I was dissatisfied, and helped me find alternative products that work for me. I cannot recommend this location more highly, and I've been shopping at Ulta in Las Vegas for many years. So pleased they opened this location at Downtown Summerlin.",positive
"Hello I am writing because I am livid with my experience on 8/10 shopping at Ulta, located in Downtown Summerlin in Las Vegas, Nevada. When I arrived yesterday afternoon at around 4:00 pm. I was taken back by the customer service and how the store General Manager Marney made me feel. Upon arrival I was immediately followed throughout the store by Marney. I was not asked if she could assist in any way. Her first words for me, was ""Don't touch those makeup Brushes""! She commented how they are not meant to be taken out of the clear showcase glass. If I am going to purchase the item, I want to feel the texture, material, etc. I was not taking it out of the pre - packaged item that was for sale. I was holding and touching the sample. She followed me througout the store and made me feel like I was a thief. She judged me the minuted I walked in to the doors. I was followed throughout the entire time after she alerted the staff. I was so upset as I have NEVER been treated like this in my entire life. After I had made my purchase asked to speak with her and told her how she made me feel. She was very rude and told me ""I follow people all day""! I can tell you not to touch those makeup brushes as they are samples not to be held. I was in complete dismay and utter disbelief! I have been a long time shopper with you. I will take my business else where and advise all of my professional colleagues and friends of my horrific experience.",negative
Clean store. Greeted upon entering. Very nice staff. Helpful when I called looking for a product and kept in on hold for an hour at the register until I could get there to pick it up. Electronic coupons no problem; they scan it off the phone. Products grouped by brand.,positive
"Received a blow-out and style at the salon the other day. Not impressed. The shampoo/condition used cold water and the chairs were so uncomfortable that my neck was in pain. Then I sat with wet hair at the stylist station for 10 minutes while she shampooed another client. This was annoying because I wanted a blow-out during my lunch break and was in a rush. The blow-out was no better than I could do myself, although my hair was very soft so that was a plus. But at $36 with a $10 off coupon, the blow-out was definitely not worth it. I would pay maybe $10-$15 but definitely not close to $50. High-end salons don't even charge $50 for a blow-out. The reason for the 2 stars instead of 1 was that everyone was very sweet. My stylist was pleasant and the manager was very sweet too. However, for $46 for something I could do myself, I will not be back.",negative
"I went to this location to get my hair cut. When I walked back to the salon the guy greeted me. He asked me what I was there for. When he went to get my stylist, I could see them both talking. He pointed at me and the girl rolled her eyes! I felt very uncomfortable the whole time. I'm not sure if that's how you operate your business. But I'm totally not going back to this location.",negative
"Worst Ulta I've ever been to. The person working at benefits brow is racist! She knew I had an appointment and was waiting right by the counter for almost an hour, I did not get any greeting or even acknowledgement for my presence. She continued on chatting with the girl she had on the chair and taking her time. It was clear she did not want to serve me. I've been going to benefits brow for two years now and go every month. This is by far the worst I've experienced. It's like they opened up another branch and put the worst staff in there! I doubt this branch will make much money given their service level now",negative
"What an amazing salon! I live in the UK and was visiting my family in the area. I'm so glad I found this place. I came into the salon desperately needing a change. From the front desk to the assistants to both of the stylists that I saw, my experience was fantastic. Ronaldo & Sadie really know how to wow their clients. Sadie was my colorist and she was absolutely amazing. She took her time and really perfected my color. Coming in, my hair was damaged and brassy but leaving Sadie's chair my hair felt brightened and healthy with the exact color and tone I requested. Ronaldo cut my hair and I absolutely love It! He took time to discuss hairstyles that complemented my face and fit my lifestyle and recommended a brilliant cut. It is one of the best cuts I have ever received! Both Ronaldo & Sadie were incredible professionals that took their time and really perfected everything. I will definitely be returning when I'm back in town next year!",positive
"First time customer yesterday at this North Central neighborhood salon, and couldn't have been happier with the results. I have very thick hair, which Renaldo took his time working with to understand the texture before cutting. I'm sold, this is my new salon!",positive
"First visit and haircut today. I have been in search of a hair salon that felt welcoming. I have found it. Sadie and Ronaldo, owners, are very congenial, fun and open. Sadie cut my hair and she took her time to understand my needs/wants. I have hair that was way too long (almost to my waist in the back) and needed to be cut. She did an excellent job of layering my hair and she cut my bangs, the best anyone has ever cut them. I asked for choppy, uneven, edgy. No one ever understands what I mean. Sadie did! YAY! I look forward to a new haircutting adventure with her during future visits. The look of the salon felt very New York, cool, sophisticated and still welcoming. Price was perfect.",positive
"Sadie and Renaldo are two talented stylists that understand our cult-like obsession with our hair. How it looks affects how we feel. Not to sound shallow, but a good hairstyle + haircut + haircolor = a good day!",positive
"Sadie is a true professional! I'm so glad I discovered this place! She knows how to get the color and tone right the first time. Very friendly and the environment is open, modern and relaxing.",positive
"poor results in the lash lift. lashes are barely even lifted, let alone curled. all other salons offer lash lifts that actually curl the lashes for a cheaper price but this place will guarantee you that the basic lash lift (lower end of the two types) will not work on most people. do not go",negative
"Update: I went to a reputable shop for Phi removal of Unyozi's horrendous microblading. The Phi technician commented that she could not believe how deep Shirley had gone when she did my microblading (and commented about how uneven my brows were by saying ""did she even measure you?!""). She said that my microblading would have definitely been **permanent** due to how deep Shirley went. I had suspected this given how little success I had had with my own attempts to fade them. It will likely take another expensive, painful removal procedure to get rid of what Shirley did. What a nightmare.",negative
"Can't say enough positive things about my experience with Shirley at UnYozi. Very clean and pleasant location, and Shirley is incredibly friendly, patient, and informative. She did an awesome job on my eyebrow microblading and I will definitely be back!!!",positive
"I did a microblading service for mens with Shirley and it was absolutely worth it. She assured me about the results, the duration on which it heals varying amongst people, and was very professional about it. I would be aware that it takes a bit of time for it to settle in and that if you have any events or special occasions, to plan it afterwards in advance to avoid the awkward ""cartoon eyebrows"". Definitely would recommend buying the product for the post care, it works very well and I haven't ran out of it yet even after a month. Be patient with it, take care of your brows afterwards and it'll turn out great! Mind you this was a 2 month process, it will vary amongst each individual!",positive
"First of all, let me start by specifying that this is with regards to a Groupon on which I had the misfortune to lose all of my money. Bought a misleading Groupon from this business. I immediately booked an appointment online and received a call a few days later, asking me to cancel that same appointment seeing as apparently ""the therapist wasn't available"" (weird! Your online booking said you were!, but anyway). This could be a technological glitch. They happen.. so I didn't say anything. She sends me a text message with my appointment details. About 5 minutes prior to my appointment, I receive a text message from her again, telling me her unit number and buzzer code. ( Uhhh.. what??)..Of course I show-up at this place, which I thought was a studio, only to realize that this is to occur in a private residence. (Of course, no research that I performed online indicated or that this was done from a private home. I mean, there are no pictures anywhere online indicating this. not even on this here Yelp listing!) URGH..I thought, but It's not like I have any other choice now, I mean Groupon has a 3 day cancelation policy for a refund, and wit this rebooking thing pushing me way over the deadline, there was no way I could get my money back from them, so I proceeded anyway.. Seeing as I was already soured by all this, I was immediately put off by the setting, and also by the misleading Groupon and decided not to go thru the procedure, as having received 14 tattoos in the past, my personal experience dictates that trust and comfort are a MUST. This goes for a tattoo which you can SEE being done.. much more a FACE tattoo.. BTW.. for those of you who think you are getting a 'deal' on your eyebrows, you are not, as while most (ALL) other microblading providers do give you a free touch- up, this woman will charge you the same as a microblading session for EACH touch-up, so in the end, you really are not getting any type of discount, at which rate, you are better off going somewhere else, with a better atmosphere and setting. My 2 cents anyway! Ah well, too bad I lost my money, hopefully this will help you not lose yours!..",negative
"I got my eyebrow microblading done by Shirley at unyozi beauty and had an awesome experience. The first time I met Shirley was at the consultation, where she took me though the whole process and I showed her pictures of the brow shape I wanted, which is was how I filled my brows in myself for years. She wasted no time by drawing out a shape that was best for me. Originally I wanted to follow the natural shape of my brow, which slopes downwards, but she recommended a different shape to open up my eye. At first I was nervous, but I trusted her professional opinion and am SO GLAD I did! She applied a numbing cream and used a laser to numb to brow area. I was surprised that in less than 5 mins my brows were numb-then she started to microblade. you can hear (but not feel) it. By the end of the procedure I couldn't feel a thing! I haven't had my final touch up yet, but am loving my new brows so far and am confident the final product will only be better. I am so glad I went to Shirley for microblading, as her knowledge and experience definitely show. Her concern is genuine, and I think that's very important when letting someone perform this kind of procedure on your face. I highly recommend going to see Shirley if you're thinking of microblading!!",positive
Shirley did an amazing job on my lashes! I had them done last week and they are still going strong! Definitely recommend her over about 5 other places I have been!,positive
I had my lashes done by Shirley a week ago. Overall I was very happy with the experience and the results. Shirley was very professional and the studio had a very relaxing atmosphere. I requested to have more natural looking extensions and Shirley really listened and worked with me to find the right length for my eye shape. After a week the lashes are still looking great and don't require much daily brushing if any.,positive
"Had a great experience with Viva Blowout, my girlfriend absolutely loved the treatment and I loved the price. I would highly recommend them if your in Las Vegas.",positive
"In Vegas for a holiday family reunion and stayed at a resort off the Strip. A friend of mine recommended Viva Blowout for getting my hair done and I am so glad I took up her suggestion. Booking was super easy and I loved the convenience of having my hair done from the comfort of my hotel room. My stylist arrived at my hotel room as scheduled, was friendly and did an excellent job. My blowout was just as good as the ones I normally get at my local Drybar in LA. The cost was comparable to the other competition when you factor in the convenience of not having to travel, wait time and tip. Highly recommend!!!!!!!",positive
"Love the convenience of having someone come to my room at Aria, this past Saturday. Crystal was a pleasure and everyone complimented my ""do"". Thank you!!",positive
We had Viva come to our pre-party this weekend and they did a great job! Everyone looked beautiful and it all went smoothly and on time! Makeup and Hair! Would def recommend and use them again.,positive
This was my first time trying a mobile makeup and hair service and I must say Caron and Sue made my first experience a very pleasant one! They were both very professional and did an absolute great job. I will definitely be booking Viva Blowout again on my next trip to Vegas.,positive
"Just got my hair done with Zanet, this is totally the way to go in Vegas! So convenient, the stylist comes to your room, with all the products and tools. Very professional, friendly, great service! Highly recommend it! And the cost is a fraction of the salon downstairs in the hotel! Thank you Zanet and Viva Blowout. Will definitely use your services again!",positive
"I loved Viva Blowout. My blowout was great. I received so many compliments and my stylist was very professional. I was a bit concerned to allow anyone in my hotel room but after getting rave reviews and a personal reference, I decided to go for it. The price was right and the experience was great. i will definitely use them again.",positive
"My brother and now sister-in-law got married last week in Las Vegas. I wanted to get the bride something special for her wedding day. I'm so glad I found Viva Blowout online. She was so happy with her hair and makeup. The big day was a big success! From the moment I called Viva Blowout, they were up front, responsive and answered all my questions. I found the pricing fair as well, especially since they came to the bride's hotel room which was super convenient. I would 100% recommend them and use them myself if and when I need this type of service in Vegas!",positive
Zanet arrived a few minutes early. Did a great job for me and my friend . She did exactly the style that we asked for quickly and efficiently . She also had a great kid personality !!thank you Viva,positive
"My company held a beauty bar during CES and reached out to several companies with similar services. From minute 1, Viva Blowout was responsive, and quick to provide information. They immediately won our business which was servicing over 20 woman who wanted to get glammed up during a busy time. We had 3 hair stylists and 2 make up artists who were all STELLAR, and our clients could not have been happier. Every girl left feeling beautiful, and it was SO much fun. I would hire them again in a heart beat and will be referring them to every single friend who is heading to Vegas for an occasion. Thank you!!!",positive
Was so happy to find these guys last minute and book hair and make up. So convenient! The stylist and make up artist were both amazing. Recommended it to all my friends and will be using Viva Blowout again.,positive
WE spent the weekend in Las Vegas for the HWY 91. Viva came to our room on Friday and Sunday to do our hair. Blowouts were great. We will use again...,positive
"Me and my friend has booked blowout services last Saturday night at 9pm so we would have the convenience of blowouts in our hotel room before going out that evening. I had specifically called ahead of time to ask if extensions were extra, and were told they are not. When the stylist got to our room... 20 minutes early... without texting or calling to let us know she was coming early (Luckily I had showered) midway through the appointments she informed us she came early so she could get to another appointment and then asked my friend to pay $20 extra for her extensions. When I politely pointed out we had called ahead and asked, she said it was up to the stylist however the website clearly says no cash is exchanged. I then texted the unknown person at Viva who I was coordinating with and asked her if we had to pay extra, she replied with a curt response informing us we did not. I then had to ask her to please reach out to the stylist and inform her that we did not have to pay extra. She did reach out to her, but never followed up, apologized or anything. We then had an extremely awkward encounter with our stylist who said that her boss informed her ""we did not want to pay"" and that she would get reimbursed on that end. Super weird and awkward...",negative
"This was my first trip to Vegas, and Caron definitely delivered! She was prompt to the hotel room, and finished me and my friend's hair right on schedule. We were there for a work conference, so we had to get our hair done at 8 am, but it was still perfect hours later. The picture I took was actually taken 12 hours later, and my hair was still looking exactly as she had styled it. Definitely worth it. Next time I come back I will definitely be booking with them again.",positive
"I can't say enough about Viva Blow Out. I booked them for two consecutive days for hair, makeup and lashes. They were on time, professional but super friendly and best of all gave me two completely different looks each night. Each look was fabulous and I got so many compliments. I am definitely booking them for my next stay in Vegas!",positive
"Caron and Nikolina did my hair and make up respectively, for my wedding. They were fantastic! Punctual, efficient and really good at what they do. Two thumbs up! :)",positive
Love the text verification including flexibility when I was running late! My hair came out PERFECT. Thank you so much!!! will definitely use Viva Blowout during our next stay.,positive
"I did a spray tan and Hair and both girls were wonderful! On-time, professional, and they did a fantastic job! I will use them every time I'm in Vegas.",positive
"I was getting married in Vegas and needed someone to do my hair for the big day! I immediately thought of Viva Blowout because I used them the last time I was in town. I only had a few days in Vegas before the wedding and Viva was able to book me with the same stylist the day of and the day before for a trial run! The stylish completely understood what I wanted with little direction! They were also able to book another stylist to do my bridesmaids hair for the wedding! Their prices are much better than other stylists charge for wedding hair! My bridesmaid and I all looked amazing the whole night, even throughout the rain! Definitely recommend to anyone who is getting married or wants to be pampered!",positive
"Was in town for business and didn't want to fuss with my hair, enter viva blowout! Came to my room at 7:30am and gave me an amazing blow out and styling! When my hair wasn't big enough from the blowout they curled it, teased it and I was thrilled with my big, beautiful hair. Highly recommend them!",positive
"What a great concept! Used this service in Vegas, and didn't have to worry about packing any hair products/tools, or doing my hair the whole trip. My girlfriends and I had Laura come to our suite and she was fantastic! We were able to hang out with everyone getting ready as opposed to leaving to get our hair done at a salon. The price was fair and well worth the convenience and being able to go out with our hair on point!",positive
"The service they offer is the best thing I ever discovered here in Vegas! I'm so glad I found Viva Blowout and would ask for their services the next time I'm back in town. My stylist Chelsea was on time and very sweet during the whole service, which was greatly appreciated. I showed her a picture and it was beyond my expectations. Thank you so much Viva!",positive
Highly recommended with five stars! I came to Las Vegas for a Sales Conference and wanted to look my best and looked for a salon to get a blow out and found Viva Blowout. The best part is a stylist comes to your hotel room so you don't have to go out searching for a salon. What a fantastic business and I'd like to do a shout out to Sam for great service and making me look gorgeous and polished in 35-40 min. It was easy to book In my mobile phone and the owner texted me the morning of my appointment to walk me through how to allow the stylist to come to my room Highly recommended and thank you again Sam!!,positive
Chelsea was great! Arrived a few minutes early to my hotel and did a wonderful job styling my hair. She was even nice enough to deal with my business call interrupting the blowout a few times (sorry!). Would highly recommend using Viva. It's easy to book and having them come to your room makes getting a blowout super convenient. Definitely worth the cost. Thanks!,positive
Just received a wonderful blowout in my hotel room during my business trip to Vegas! Scheduling my appointment online was totally painless (the team even graciously accommodated 2 time changes due to my work schedule) and my blowout looks perfect. Super professional- and so amazing I didn't have to step foot out of my hotel room during the whole process. Highly recommended.,positive
This is a review for the wonderful customer service. I was booking a group of blowouts from another city and was so impressed with the Viva Blowout team. They were responsive to my emails and kept in constant contact with me through texts and calls. They were able to accommodate my needs and the booking and payment process was very easy! Thank you for all of your help!,positive
"As my trip to Las Vegas approached, I kept nervously checking the weather. I have hair that when not blown-out ends up as a giant, frizzy curly mess. The predicted temperature was 105. Amid my growing panic, I started searching for a blow-out place. Viva Blowout came to my rescue. They accommodated my 7am call time (I had a day of meetings) and even came to my hotel. Zanet arrived a few minutes early (one of my favorite traits in people) and proceeded to give me an excellent blow out. She was fast, professional and did an excellent job. I would highly recommend this service. Now we just need to get you guys to come to Chicago!",positive
"Slam Dunk!!!! Best service to come to Las Vegas I guess wishing on a star really makes dreams come true! Samantha is very good at her craft and she is fun and witty to chat with, she can move in with me!! Thanks Viva Blowout!!",positive
"I used Viva Blowout for my birthday weekend in Vegas and it was everything that I hoped it would be! My stylist, Zanet, was amazing ... she was always on time and really took the time to make a hairstyle that suited me. One day I went curly and the other I went straight ... I absolutely loved both looks. I would highly recommend Viva Blowout to anyone who wants to have a stress-free hair day in Vegas. Will definitely use them again :)",positive
"I am new to Las Vegas from NYC, and I definitely am one of those annoying people that says, ""it's good, but it's not like NYC..."" Yes, I am that person! Last week, I hesitantly booked a blowout from ViVa Blowout expecting a subpar experience compared to my beloved ex-city. Cue the harps! In walks Samantha, bubbly, friendly, fast and fantastic. She listened to my hair woes and was patient when I detailed the exact way I like my bangs parted and laying on my forehead (thus is an exact science!) I am happy to report that it was BETTER than my last few blowouts in NYC! Yes, I am eating crow, pass the ketchup!",positive
"WARNING - If I could give a negative rating I would. This woman does not know what she is doing when it comes to tape-in extensions. After removing my extensions she was too lazy to remove the old tape and put the new tape on the old tape, then proceeded to use a hot iron melting the tape into my hair. The subsequent removal took almost 2 hours to complete with massive amounts of hair being ripped from my scalp. After 2 hours there was an incredible amount of adhesive still stuck in my hair whilst she proceeded to explain to me that this was typical for tape in extensions, which it is not. I spoke with manufacturer about their products and tape has a cold bonding adhesive and is NOT to be applied with heat as this will melt the adhesive into the hair and cause the damage I have described above. It was incredibly painful and has caused serious damage to my hair that will take years to grow back if at all. PS hair colour has nothing to do with this.",negative
"Been going here several times and have to say she is one of the best hair-dressers. She is very attentive, helpful, pleasant and treats her customers with respect. A true professional! have reccomended her to others!",positive
"I wish I could give a higher rating. I have been seeing Joyce for almost 10 years now. She is the only hairdresser I have ever remained loyal to. She is the only one in the city who knows how to make a weave stay for months in Caucasian hair. She is giving and cares about her clients. She always checks up on me to make sure I'm happy and she has never ever disappointed. I have sent countless people to Wavelength Hair Studio over the years and they all rave about their hair! Anyone who gives this salon a bad rating clearly has an axe to grind- or they are on drugs (hey, it's Yonge Street.) Joyce is the best at her craft in the city. I've never met anyone who comes close to comparison.",positive
"I'm going to begin my review by doing something I rarely if ever have done... by defending the honor of a true professional and wonderful lady. I was shocked and appalled when I read many of the reviews posted here about Wavelengths Hair studio and later in my review I will address these concerns in greater detail but first my experience at this salon I recently decided to make the change and go with fusion extensions instead of having to clip in my extensions every time I needed long hair, which turns out to be a lot with the work that I do. So I began to research my options both online and by phone; believe me I spent much time gathering info and comparing salons but Joice stood out immediately as she was one of the only ones who would quote prices on the phone and the only one who provided a variety of options, catering towards quality but affordability. I called back many times with a barrage of questions which she answered politely and efficiently with a keen understanding of the care and consideration something like this takes. I eventually decided to go with one of the options she presented me with, which was to go buy my own hair (which would work out cheaper) and she would apply it. She quoted me a very affordable price and was accommodating schedule-wise so I set my appointment. The salon itself is located on a little side street called Irwin with surprisingly ample parking as there is street parking and underground public parking just up the street. Small but tidy and quaint this is a full service hair salon with the specialty in Hair Extensions. As soon as I walked in I recognized not only the voice but the generally warm and friendly vibe I got from speaking with Joice on the phone. I came in with a bang, almost knocking over a mirror and chair in my clumsiness but she was her bubbly and accommodating self and made me feel right at home. She explained to me the process and some info about care, maintenance ect.. but as she proceeded she noticed I had bought pre-bonded keratin packs, which she informed me wouldn't be the ideal option so she went with a shank method that was MUCH more expensive but because she quoted me a certain price on the phone she actually honored that. I was SHOCKED! Not only that but she really knew her craft and how to work the best she could with the materials provided. Throughout it all she was conscious of price and quality even making the move to space out my extensions because I had only bought 100g though she made it look full and natural. My hairstylist even went out of her way to compliment the job and I have trusted her opinion for a while now as she has saved my hair many a time from silly dye jobs and wacky cement hair styles. Joice even gave me a clip in highlight cause I was asking about pink highlights, really the generosity was incredible! The whole procedure was no more then 2hrs in total, prob not even that and it was a pleasure to sit and chat with such a kindred spirit like Joice so the time passes by even quicker. After it was done I couldn't get over the feeling of the hair it was amazing! So light and natural looking... blended perfectly and was literally invisible even with my hair up . The salon itself also offers a fantastic incentive for referral too, any guest you refer gives you 15% off your next visit now I have never heard of that before. She also gave me a very reasonable deal to remove them when it comes time and if I do choose to get them redone it will DEFINITELY be here!! Now I have never done this before but feel compelled to call out the two resoundingly negative reviews I have read here because I feel Yelp is a place for people to find TRUTHFUL, HELPFUL and HONEST reviews not petty, childish attacks at a business and persons reputation. These businesses are run by human beings that deserve the respect of decency and making personal attacks publicly and using yelp to slander or berate someone is not what this site is intended for. We as reviewers have an obligation to not only be truthful and respectful but be mindful of the consequences of our words as these are peoples livelihoods we are affecting after all. So if your going to leave such a negative review/rating be sure to give ample reason and try to remain objective.",positive
"I went to Joyce for weave hair extensions. She is really good at it. She was recommended to me by Cosmetic World - 623 Yonge St. My hair didn't pull and felt completely natural. I got tons of compliments. She also put great highlights in it. Joyce seems to be quite experienced with extensions and more importantly is creative. Also, I took hand-woven hair and she knew all about how to work with it (different from machine-weft). She is nice and listened to what I wanted. Just work with her and you will get a good result. Also I found her salon to be very comfortable unlike the typical rushed, hectic and sales-like atmosphere of other salons. Make sure you do your own research on where to buy your hair to get the best-looking and quality hair - Joyce will have suggestions as well, and from what I understand she will start to carry her own supply. She seems to really know what good quality hair is, but as to where to buy it you must do ur own research ! Note: She does it differently than other typical hair weaving places - her website says she specializes in Caucasian hair for weaving and that would seem to be true. I gave 4 stars because ""Yay! I'm a fan."" I will reserve a 5 ""This is as good as it gets"" for when I have been there enough to really know that. I am really happy with what I got.",positive
"WARNING - The owner threatened to sue me again today (Feb 2018) since the last threat (mid-2017)... I logged in after a long lull, planning on deleting mean girl reviews I wrote during my teenage years but srsly?? Be careful if you're a walk-in, don't you dare voice any concerns to Joyce, her first response will be ""You just see who gets the last laugh when I take you to court for libel!"" Just told her to stop perennially threaten me with court orders over this review (I really was considering taking this down if she changes her mind)...but nope. She insists she'll take me to court. - - - - - (2010 experience) Ever want to get royally shafted?!? 3 cut & up'do's, in a 3-hour appointment slot (set up 2 weeks ahead of time). 7 hours later: - my friend's highlights turned GREEN: they blamed it on the fact that she didn't tell the stylist she sometimes dye her hair with drug store hair dyes. - I didn't get my haircut because they spent the whole afternoon trying to fix my friend's hair (and FAILED). We were late for the event because it took up 7 HOURS. We sat there from 2p.m. to 8:45p.m.. We came out with a handful of company logo-emblazoned cosmetic mirrors, ball-point pens and lip balms as souveniers. Luckily my boyfriend got his haircut first (1:45p.m.) and he wasn't expecting anything other than a crew cut. And I am glad our up-do's were creative ones; it was up, thick and fierce, and has some structure to it. Looked like we were the only clients that entire day. There's no way they're convincing any of us to fork out $950 for Cinderella Hair Extensions. We were nice clients, they were nice people but obviously the stylists need to go back to barber college.",negative
"After having such an unfortunate experience at Whitehouse the first time, I was contacted by both the manager and owner to apologize and invite me back. This kind of dedication to customers is not often seen and I was struck by how sincerely they wanted to make things right. So I went in to get my hair and nails done and had such a great experience. My hairstylist did such a great job listening to what I wanted but also offering great tips. Easily the best haircut I've had in a while. Jimmy did my nails and he was wonderful- really great attention to detail. Overall I would say this salon lives up to all of the recommendations I was given- and will highly recommend to others!",positive
"I had a haircut appointment with Lacy today. She is one of the art directors at the Whitehouse Salon, and the title encouraged me to leave aside my trust issues when it comes to trusting a new hair stylist. And I should say I'm glad I did so! I showed Lacy some pictures of the hair cut I was envisioning, and also explained to her how I wanted my hair to look like and feel like, and boom! she gave me a beautiful layered haircut with lots of texture and natural movement. I'd definitely go back and I'd recommend her!",positive
"Coming from San Diego, I was worried I wouldn't find a place that caters to men and gives upscale haircuts and treatment. I worry no longer after finding this place. Everyone is very professional, and always happy with my cut.",positive
"The staff could not be any nicer. Conversations are great, atmosphere is great and the cuts are second to none in this area. They really go above and beyond to create a welcoming environment. Rachel is my stylist and have never received a better cut.",positive
"This place is amazing. My last few haircuts at other local establishments have been terrible, but Wise Guys is a cut above the rest. I was promptly greeted upon entering the establishment and made to feel welcome. Their wide array of services were tailored to my specific requests, as Nadine and the staff were extremely accommodating. In the end, I received a great haircut that both my wife and I love. I will definitely return!",positive
"Came across this place while traveling for business. Wish there was a place like it where I live. The facility was clean and stylish. Nadine, the owner, was my stylist. She was friendly and gave me a great haircut.",positive
"As a man who cares about their appearance, a hair cut completes it. With a friendly staff, nice layout, and clean facility this place is great. Very professional staff who gave me a great cut. The only reason I give this place a 4 star is because I scheduled an appointment for 6:30 and the man in front of me who didn't have an appointment somehow got in the booth before me. Although it it may have been a simple mistake due to our names bring too close, They were 20 or so minutes late to get me in. I assume this will only happen once and that it was a simple mistake. I highly recommend getting your haircut here if you realized that great clips or any of the amateur chains we're butchering your dome. They provide 5 star haircuts and service and I plan to be back as soon as I need another cut.",positive
I've dropped in on this place periodically when traveling on business - it is now called Wise Guys. This is a great place to get a haircut with a lot of different services provided at reasonable prices. Scalp massage and hot stone neck massage are amazing stress relievers and was told they do a great facial massage. Radine was my stylist and will definitely book her again.,positive
I have had the privilege of having both Rachel and Nadine cut my hair (and my son's hair) over the years. They are both amazing stylists! So excited for their new salon!,positive
