**WEB SCRAPING REVIEWS: Data Science with Python**

**TECHNOLOGY USED:** Python

**IDE:** Jupyter Notebook

**AIM:** Scrape consumer reviews from a set of web pages and to evaluate the performance of text classification algorithms on the data.

Each review has a star rating. For this assignment, we will assume that 1-star to 3-star reviews are “negative”, and 4-star to 5-star reviews are “positive”.

**TASKS:**

1. Select three review categories of your choice. Scrape all reviews for each category and store them as three separate datasets. For each review, there is a review text and a class label (i.e. “positive” or “negative”).
2. For each of the three category datasets:
  
    a. From the reviews in this category, apply preprocessing steps to create a numeric representation of the data, suitable for classification.
  
    b. Build a classification model to distinguish between “positive” and “negative” reviews using one of the following classifiers:
        
        Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Random Forests
  
    c. Test the predictions of the classification model using an appropriate evaluation strategy.
  
3. Evaluate the performance of each of the three classification models when applied to data from the other two selected categories:
  
    a. Train a classification model on the data from “Category A”. Evaluate its performance on data from “Category B” and “Category C”.
  
    b. Train a classification model on the data from “Category B”. Evaluate its performance on data from “Category A” and “Category C”.
  
    c. Train a classification model on the data from “Category C”. Evaluate its performance on data from “Category A” and “Category B”.
