**EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS: NBA GAMES**

**TECHNOLOGY USED:** Python

**IDE:** Jupyter

**AIM:** Collect a dataset from one or more open web APIs, and use Python to prepare and analyse the collected data.

**TASKS:**

1. Data identification:
 
      •  Choose at least one open web API as your data source (i.e. not a static or pre-collected dataset). If you decide to use more than one API, these APIs should be related in some way.

2. Data collection:
  
      • Collect data from your API(s) using Python. Depending on the API(s), you may need to repeat the collection process multiple times to download sufficient data.

      • Store the collected data in an appropriate file format for subsequent analysis (e.g. JSON, XML, CSV).

3. Data preparation and analysis:

      • Load and represent the data using an appropriate data structure (i.e. records/items as rows, described by features as columns).
  
      • Apply any preprocessing steps that might be required to clean or filter the data before analysis. Where more than one API is used, apply suitable data integration methods.
  
      • Analyse, characterise, and summarise the cleaned dataset, using tables and plots where appropriate. Clearly explain and interpret any analysis results which are produced.
  
      • Summarise any insights which you gained from your analysis of the data. Suggest ideas for further analysis which could be performed on the data in future.
